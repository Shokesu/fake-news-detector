The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently issued a new proposed rule entitled “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science.” Sounds like a good idea, right? Well, that is the point—to make it sound good. Not as many people would like it if they called it “Censoring Science in Rulemaking,” which would be much closer to the reality of the new policy’s impact.

Essentially the proposed rule would require that the agency only use science for which the underlying data is fully public. Again, it sounds pretty good at first. But there are very valid reasons researchers don’t publish all the underlying data—personal privacy being the biggest one. Major health studies often collect large amounts of information about the people who agree to participate. No one wants their personal health information published. In fact there are laws strictly prohibiting sharing a person’s medical information, namely the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

EPA’s proposed rule claims there are ways to mask data to ensure privacy is protected, but those efforts are not foolproof. Even when personal identifying information is removed from data, it can be possible to identify individuals in the right circumstances from a combination of simple data points. The best way to protect personal privacy is to not publish the detailed data underlying these studies.

If the policy goes into effect, the EPA won’t be able to use those large human health studies even though they have been conducted by reputable researchers and academic institutions, and peer reviewed to ensure validity. Instead, they will be left with industry studies that more often use animal test subjects, which don’t have personal privacy concerns when it comes to detailed data.

In a published letter from the heads of six major scientific journals, editors note that while data sharing contributes to the robustness of scientific results, “in not every case can all data be fully shared.” They raise concerns about limiting scientific evidence, and conclude that “excluding relevant studies simply because they do not meet rigid transparency standards will adversely affect decision-making processes.”

The EPA’s proposed policy also seeks to ensure “reproducible scientific assessments,” which again sounds reasonable but can actually be used to eliminate important findings of dangerous exposures that have occurred. Studies such as those that linked leaded gasoline to brain damage in children or a Harvard study that found a link between fine particulate air pollution and premature deaths examine dangerous real world exposures and cannot be safely repeated. Just because they can’t—or shouldn’t—be repeated doesn’t mean we should ignore the vital insights they provide. The knowledge we have gained from these tragedies can and should be used to help prevent future problems.

So the policy will result in the agency having less science to work with—and will quite likely force the agency to rely on more industry-funded studies. It is important to note that while there are plenty of quality studies funded by industries, there are also serious risks for conflicts of interest with industry studies. New regulations from an agency like EPA can cost companies millions to comply with, so when industry studies conclude that such regulations are unnecessary, it is only reasonable to want confirmation of those findings from independent scientists that don’t have a financial stake in the outcome.

Placing large portions of scientific research off limits for agencies goes against common sense. We should want agencies to be able use any and all information available to produce the best, most up to date rules. If a study is unreliable or flawed in some way, then the agency can decide that based solely on the study’s own merits. And sometimes even flawed or partial studies can offer important insights that the EPA should benefit from.

Consider a scenario where you or a loved one gets a serious diagnosis. You want your doctor to consider every piece of information that could help—international research, results from experimental treatments, studies of related illnesses, and early reports from research currently underway. Do we really want to use a different standard when EPA is seeking to protect the health of whole communities across the entire country?

The proposed rule would not actually require the government to be more transparent but, instead, demands a new level of transparency from academic and industry studies, a level of transparency that has questionable merit. The reality is that agencies are already required to be pretty transparent when it comes to rulemaking, including about the science they use. When rules are proposed EPA has to state which scientific studies they relied on and explain why they chose those studies. The agency already determines to weight studies differently or not use them on their merits as a function of their methodological clarity and data quality. The notice and comment period for a rule allows outside stakeholders to raise concerns or problems with the science used or offer alternative studies. And the agency has to consider and respond to those comments, which commonly occurs in the form of an extensive explanation that accompanies the final rule in the Federal Register.

The EPA is accepting comments on their proposed rule until May 30. Environmental groups are already pushing to have that deadline extended, almost certainly so they can offer a more comprehensive refutation of the proposal. However, the EPA could press forward no matter how compelling and convincing an argument opponents offer in the comment process. If so, the agency will almost certainly face a court battle next and it could be a difficult one.

Back during the George W. Bush Administration, the American Trucking Association filed suit against EPA over air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone. One of things they argued was that EPA denied them essential procedural right by failing to make public underlying data for the key studies used. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against that point agreeing with EPA that such a requirement would be “impractical and unnecessary.”

The three judge panel, two appointed by Ronald Reagan and one by Bill Clinton, said in greater detail:

“If EPA and other governmental agencies could not rely on published studies without conducting an independent analysis of the enormous volume of raw data underlying them, then much plainly relevant scientific information would become unavailable to EPA for use in setting standards to protect public health and the environment.... [S]uch data are often the property of scientific investigators and are often not readily available because of ... proprietary interests ... or because of [confidentiality] arrangements [with study participants].”

In the proposed rule the agency notes that “the best available science must serve as the foundation of EPA’s regulatory actions.” It is hard to argue with that as a fundamental principle. But this policy won’t make scientific information better or more available. Instead, the new rule will often mean the best available science is off limits to the agency. This is a “solution” for a problem that doesn’t exist. In fact, it is a problem dressed up like a solution. It would severely limit the information EPA can use, threaten the personal privacy of those participating in human health studies, and make it more difficult to produce large human health studies. And it’s a problem we don’t need to saddle the EPA with.

2,1,,"A black Yale student was taking a nap in a common room in her dorm earlier this week when a white student saw her sleeping and decided to call the police.

Lolade Siyonbola, who is a graduate student at Yale, was woken up by the classmate and interrogated by law enforcement for 15 minutes. According to Siyonbola, the white student told police that she appeared out of place in the building.

“I deserve to be here. I pay tuition like everybody else,”  Siyonbola told police officers in a video posted to Facebook. “I’m not going to justify my existence here.”

The Yale incident is the latest in a number of recent, high-profile cases where people of color have been racially profiled, confronted by police, and, in some cases, arrested after white business owners, employees, or bystanders viewed them with suspicion. Many of the incidents have spread on social media, calling national attention to the issue.

In April, two black men, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, were arrested for trespassing as they waited inside a Philadelphia Starbucks for a business partner. The men later said they had been inside the Starbucks for mere minutes before the store’s manager called 911 because they sat down without ordering anything.

Not long after this, a black woman was violently arrested inside a Saraland, Alabama, Waffle House and had the front of her shirt pulled down by police officers after a manager called 911 because of a dispute over an extra charge on the woman’s bill.

That same month, the owner of a golf club in Pennsylvania called police on a group of black women who they said were playing too slowly. On April 30, two Native American teenagers were pulled aside by police during a tour of Colorado State University after a white parent on the tour called them. And on May 8, the president of Nordstrom Rack issued an apology after employees at a Missouri location called the police on three black men who were shopping for prom, accusing them of shoplifting. A white customer in the store called the men “a bunch of bums” as they looked through items.

If “shopping while black” and “driving while black” have been long used to describe a tendency for people and police to treat black people with suspicion, recent incidents have provided an increasing number of scenarios to add to the list.

But while it’s tempting to think that this recent wave of incidents is proof that this is a new phenomenon, that’s definitely not the case.

As many black writers have pointed out recently, people of color have long been subject to racial profiling in public, or private, spaces. If anything has changed, it’s that social media and the ubiquity of cell phone cameras have made it easier for black and brown people to share footage of confrontations and arrests in real time.

But though they’re not new, these incidents are a reminder that decades after the collapse of legal segregation, spaces like clothing stores, coffee shops, and universities remain strongly controlled along racial lines.

They also highlight something more complicated. Many people of color already have a tense relationship with law enforcement, due to documented racial bias, disparities in police use of force, and the impacts of officer-involved shootings. When white Americans needlessly call law enforcement on people of color, it’s making an existing problem worse.

When looking at the incidents that have occurred over the past month, one thing that stands out is how minor some of the alleged offenses are — and that someone feeling suspicious or uncomfortable is enough to warrant calling law enforcement.

For example, when a woman recently called police on a trio of black filmmakers staying in an Airbnb in Rialto, California, she told authorities that she was suspicious because they didn’t wave to her.

The owner of the Airbnb agreed with the neighbor, saying at a police press conference that “If the kids had simply smiled at (my neighbor) and waved back and acknowledged her and said, ‘We’re just Airbnb guests checking out,’ none of this would have ever happened. But instead, they were rude, unkind, not polite.”

Some people on social media have attempted to justify Siyonbola’s ordeal at Yale by saying she was “rude” for sleeping in the common room of her dorm.

These examples show how people of color are subject to arbitrary social expectations and heightened scrutiny. And it’s a phenomenon that academics argue is more likely to happen in places where people of color, especially black people, are in the minority.

Yale sociologist Elijah Anderson notes that there is a difference between “white spaces,” where black people are often not present, or exist in a limited number, and “black spaces,” communities and spaces occupied by larger numbers of black people.

And because so much of America remains divided along racial lines, black people who enter white spaces are often viewed with suspicion unless they are in a service position, like working as a store clerk or a waiter. And as gentrification increases the number of these spaces, this can create huge difficulties.

Anderson notes that part of this suspicion arises from commonly held stereotypes of black people as being criminal and black behavior as being deviant. As a result, black people in these “white spaces” are forced to justify their presence, and face consequences when that justification isn’t accepted by others.

“In the minds of many of their detractors, to scrutinize and stop black people is to prevent crime and protect the neighborhood,” he explained in a 2015 paper. “Thus, for the black person, particularly young males, virtually every public encounter results in a degree of scrutiny that a ‘normal,’ white person would certainly not need to endure.”

But according to academic and writer Tressie McMillan Cottom, the desire to protect space in these instances is not simply motivated by concerns about safety or the desire to “see something, say something” — but a need for control.

On Twitter, Cottom explained that recent incidents like the one at Yale are rooted in an effort to preserve racial hierarchy by showing that black people can be removed at any time.  “At millions of places, in a billion different interactions across the country ... a white person is doing all the daily management of white spaces and places,” she wrote.

If the recent spate of incidents has sparked a conversation about why black people are met with so much suspicion in public, another important part of the conversation focuses on why the police are being asked to respond to situations where they aren’t really needed.

And when white people call law enforcement on people of color for unnecessary reasons, they are adding to an existing problem, since minority groups are more likely to face police violence, or harsh punishment from the justice system.

You don’t need to look far for examples of how this can play out.

In 2015, white residents of a McKinney, Texas, neighborhood called police on a group of black high schoolers holding a pool party, complaining about noise. One adult allegedly told the teenagers to return to “Section 8 [public] housing.” When police arrived, a black girl was violently slammed to the ground and pinned by an officer. Residents later posted signs thanking the officers for “keeping us safe.”

In 2014, John Crawford was fatally shot by police inside an Ohio Walmart after a man called 911, telling the dispatcher that Crawford was pointing the gun at people. Crawford was holding a BB gun, and video footage later showed that he was not waving the weapon.

As the Atlantic’s Adam Harris notes, black and white people call law enforcement at different rates, with people of color calling the police less often. And that difference is driven by a crucial perception: While white people see police as a force that will protect them, communities of color see a force that is more likely to do the opposite.

There’s a real reason for that. In addition to studies that reveal racial disparities in police use of force, data collected by the Guardian shows that black Americans are more likely than whites to be shot by police, when controlling for population.

And as Vox’s German Lopez has noted, high-profile incidents of police violence erode trust in law enforcement, and that trust can be difficult to regain. A 2016 study from a group of sociologists at Yale, Harvard, and Oxford found that after the 2004 police beating of Frank Jude in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, residents made 17 percent fewer 911 calls the next year. And those numbers remained low even after the officers involved in the incident had been punished. Researchers found similar results after high-profile incidents of police brutality in other predominantly black communities.

“White people have not had the same difficult relationship with police and state-sanctioned violence, making them less likely to fear harm by police,” Harris writes. “For black people, an examination of that history can easily discourage someone from picking up the phone —even when they’re in need of help.”

Put together, the incidents like the one at the Philadelphia Starbucks, Yale, and countless other places serve as additional proof of persistent racial divisions in the US. And those divisions, which include assumptions of black guilt in the most minor of circumstances, lead to more policing — part of a much larger problem.

3,1,,"Friday afternoon, the Justice Department released an indictment that’s part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

The indictment outlines the lengths Russia went to influence the election in favor of Donald Trump and against Hillary Clinton — including by supporting Bernie Sanders (and, later, Jill Stein).

The Russian operations on social media were meant to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton and other candidates, including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. And they were supposed to support Sanders and Trump.

“Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump—we support them),” they were directed, according to the indictment.

This was because the Russians involved really didn’t like Hillary Clinton.

Around September 14 in 2016, for example, one “account specialist” of a Russian-controlled Facebook group called “Secured Borders” was reprimanded for having a “low number of posts dedicated to criticizing Hillary Clinton.”

The specialist was also told, “it is imperative to intensify criticizing Hillary Clinton.”

Later on, Russian operatives used accounts they controlled — including an account called “Woke Blacks” and “Blacktivist” — to urge Americans to vote for third-party candidates or not to vote at all. “Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein,” one such message read. “Trust me, it’s not a wasted vote.”

Kremlin-linked Russian politician Alexander Torshin traveled frequently between Moscow and various destinations in the United States to build relationships with figures on the American right starting as early as 2009, beyond his previously known contacts with the National Rifle Association.

Documents newly obtained by NPR show how he traveled throughout the United States to cultivate ties in ways well beyond his formal role as a member of the Russian legislature and later as a top official at the Russian central bank. These are steps a former top CIA official believes Torshin took in order to advance Moscow's long-term objectives in the United States, in part by establishing common political interests with American conservatives.

""[Vladimir] Putin and probably the Russian intelligence services saw [Torshin's connections] as something that they could leverage in the United States,"" said Steve Hall, a retired CIA chief of Russian operations. ""They reach out to a guy like Torshin and say, 'Hey, can you make contact with the NRA and some other conservatives ... so that we can have connectivity from Moscow into those conservative parts of American politics should we need them?' And that's basically just wiring the United States for sound, if you will, in preparation for whatever they might need down the road.""

Torshin's trips took him to Alaska, where he requested a visit with former Gov. Sarah Palin; to the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D. C.; to Nashville, where he was an election observer for the 2012 presidential race; and to every NRA convention, in various American cities, between 2012 and 2016.

But the jig is up. Last month, Torshin was designated for sanctions by the U. S. Treasury Department.

""We can conclude that the administration thought he was acting to advance Putin's malign agenda, but what precisely [he did] they did not make clear,"" said Daniel Fried, a former State Department coordinator for sanctions policy who helped craft the sanctions that ultimately were employed against Torshin.

Torshin's outreach to the United States started well before Russia's now-public campaign of electoral interference during the 2016 elections. And it appears to be a cultivated effort to reach out to conservatives, even in its earliest stages.

""I really do think the Russians are looking at being able to reach out to the right ... to say, 'Hey, you know Russians actually share a lot of the same values,' "" said Hall, whose 30-year career in the CIA concluded in 2015.

Hall said their message was: ""You know, we don't like LGBT causes any more than you conservatives on the right in the United States do; we are interested in engaging the NRA ... the church plays an important role in Russia just as it should in the United States.""

Torshin's earliest known visit to the United States was in 2009, when he requested a meeting with former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin — a request that has never before been reported.

An email from the former Alaska governor's archives, released because of a public records request from activist Andree McLeod and posted online en masse by then-Alaska Dispatch News reporter Richard Mauer, shows how Torshin made the approach through the Russian ambassador to the U. S., who was then-Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

An aide wrote to Palin in May of 2009: ""You had received a request to call the Russian Ambassador regarding a proposed visit by Mr. Alexander Torshin... Torshin will be visiting Alaska on June 6, 2009 and we have asked the Lt. Governor to meet with him."" Neither the Russian Embassy nor Palin responded to a request for comment.

The lieutenant governor at the time was Sean Parnell, who would go on later to become the governor of Alaska. Parnell told NPR he doesn't recall meeting with Mr. Torshin, nor did the name ring a bell — but he said it wouldn't be odd for him to take such a meeting.

""It wouldn't be unusual for Alaska's Lt. Governor to take a meeting with a visiting foreign dignitary, especially if the Governor's Office had been approached first by the visitor/visiting delegation to schedule a meeting and the governor had declined,"" Parnell said in an email.

Torshin's travels in the United States continued with a strange trip to Tennessee. Public records requests made by NPR shed light on how Torshin managed to become an election observer in Nashville during the 2012 presidential elections.

""The interesting thing about election monitoring is it does get foreign officials out and about in places that they perhaps might not usually go,"" said Hall, the former CIA chief of Russian operations. ""It wouldn't be uncommon for either somebody like Mr. Torshin, or a diplomat, or a Russian intelligence officer to appear in places like Washington or New York ... But a place like Nashville, or other locations in the United States, provide sort of an insight about what's really going on in the heartland.""

A memo left for Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett on Oct. 11, 2012, shows that local lawyer Kline Preston, known for his support of Putin, made the application for election observer status on behalf of Torshin.

""Russian Senator Alexander Torshin would like to observe our Presidential election. Polling stations,"" the 2012 message reads.

An email from Tennessee Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins shows that Torshin requested visits to the Davidson County Election Commission and the Williamson County Election Commission. And a sign-in sheet showed that he visited the polling station at Grassland Middle School in Williamson County, Tenn.

According to these documents, Torshin was accompanied by a Russian diplomat named Igor Matveev. Matveev had postings in Syria and the United States and is fluent in Arabic and English. Hall said that Matveev, who did not respond to a request for comment from NPR, fit the profile of a professional diplomat rather than an intelligence operative due to his background, ""but basically the Russian intelligence services can and do oftentimes co-opt standard diplomats to do their bidding for them.""

Torshin made no secret of his visit to Tennessee, and posted it on Twitter, as he has many of his visits to the U. S. He even posted a photo of himself in line at a Nashville-area polling place.

Translation: ""Standing in line to the voting station. Like an average American. 6.45 am.""

Russia has a long history of politicizing the use of election monitors — for example using Western, pro-Putin observers to vouch for the validity of its contested elections.

Preston, who arranged for Torshin's 2012 election observation status in his hometown of Nashville, recently went to Crimea. In a trip reported by a Russian state operated news agency, Preston declared that the election process in Crimea, which Russian annexed in 2014, was open, honest and trustworthy. He did not respond to a list of questions provided by NPR.

There were very few international doubts about the fairness of America's 2012 presidential elections, which makes Torshin's visit to Nashville for this ostensible purpose all the more perplexing.

And while there have been election monitors in the United States in the past, it usually involves an international organization like the OSCE, which during the 2012 elections sent 44 observers throughout the U. S. to monitor the elections.

""There are, of course, no real elections in Russia that Vladimir Putin doesn't approve of and essentially run himself,"" Hall said. ""So the idea that any Russian entity would go to be an election monitor anywhere in the world is, of course, on its face ridiculous. It's sort of like sending an alcoholic to the distillery to make sure that everything is going OK.""

More frequent visits leading up to 2016 campaign

From 2012 to 2016, Torshin began making regular visits to the United States that suggested Russians were trying to find common cause on issues like religion and guns. Torshin attended every National Rifle Association convention during this time and met high-ranking NRA officials.

These trips took him all across the American heartland, with stops in St. Louis, Houston, Indianapolis, Nashville and Louisville. Last month, the NRA acknowledged Torshin was a life member of the NRA and has been since 2012, but insisted he only ever paid his membership dues to the organization. The gun rights group said it had received $2,500 from about 23 Russia-linked contributors since 2015.

""Based on Mr. Torshin's listing as a specially designated national as of April 6, we are currently reviewing our responsibilities with respect to him,"" NRA general counsel John Frazer wrote to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., last month. The NRA has denied wrongdoing and says that it does not accept funds from foreign persons ""in connection with United States elections.""

Over a similar time period, Torshin also reportedly made repeated trips to Washington, D. C., to attend the National Prayer Breakfast — Yahoo reported that he even had a meeting scheduled with newly inaugurated President Donald Trump during the breakfast in 2017, but that the president pulled out at the last minute when an aide figured out who Torshin was. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Further, Torshin facilitated reciprocal trips during these years in which he brought Americans to Russia. In 2013 and 2015, he hosted gun rights advocates in Russia, including former NRA president David Keene, whom he developed a close relationship with.

His visits to America sometimes puzzled those who saw him there, as he appeared to have no serious expertise in the field he was purportedly representing. A speech Torshin gave in Washington, D. C., in March 2015, as deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, left some in the audience perplexed.

""For anyone at the lunch who's remotely familiar with finance or the world of central banking, Torshin demonstrated no significant expertise in either realm,"" said a former U. S. official who was at the event. ""Torshin's performance was all the more surprising, given the big questions circulating at that time about the fate of the Russian economy, sanctions, Western diplomatic isolation, and the like.""

In fact, for those observing Torshin, what he was best known for was not central banking, but allegations of money laundering. In 2013 Spanish authorities alleged that Torshin helped a Russian mob syndicate in Moscow launder money through banks and properties in Spain, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

""It is extraordinary and outrageous that a man caught in international money laundering was appointed ... to become deputy chair of the Russian Central Bank,"" said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center.

Torshin's travels to the United States continued through to perhaps his most infamous trip: The NRA convention in 2016, where he attempted to get a meeting with then-candidate Trump.

According to a report written by Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Torshin used a Republican strategist named Paul Erickson as an intermediary to set up a meeting with Trump himself.

""Happenstance and the (sometimes) international reach of the NRA placed me in a position a couple of years ago to slowly begin cultivating a back-channel to President Putin's Kremlin,"" Erickson wrote to Rick Dearborn, a senior campaign official and a longtime adviser to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

That meeting never occurred — though Torshin did meet Donald Trump Jr. at an event during the convention. Trump Jr. claims they did not discuss the election.

Sanctions mean the jig is up

On April 6, the U. S. Treasury Department specifically designated Torshin as a target of U.S. sanctions — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the agency targeted ""those who benefit from the Putin regime and play a key role in advancing Russia's malign activities.""

The sanctions mean that any assets Torshin has in the United States could be seized, and the travel to America that punctuated his life for years will end.

""He's, for lack of a better term, become radioactive, certainly to the United States, but really the global financial institutions, that are unlikely to be willing to do any business with him for fear of secondary sanctions from the U. S. Treasury Department,"" said Boris Zilberman, who works on the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance.

He also reportedly faces scrutiny from congressional investigators probing the 2016 election and the FBI. McClatchy has reported that the FBI is investigating whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the National Rifle Association to help Trump's 2016 campaign. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

Hall said it also probably reflected intelligence gathered on Torshin's intentions over years of travel to the United States.

""The fact that Torshin has now been personally sanctioned ... is an indication that the administration ... has seen, probably, intelligence reporting on Torshin and his background, and perhaps what the plans and intentions of the Russian government vis-a-vis Mr. Torshin,"" Hall told NPR. ""It shows that our system ... is doing its job in informing policymakers about the dangers of somebody like Torshin.""

For years, Torshin built relationships with governors, NRA bigwigs and conservative activists — making a point of traveling to the United States repeatedly to expand those ties. But with Torshin's designation as a target of U. S. sanctions last month, that door has been closed.

Torshin did not respond to a list of questions provided by NPR.

6,1,0.0,"(Reuters) – AT&T Inc on Friday ousted its top lobbyist, and the No. 2 wireless carrier’s chief executive officer said in a memo it was “big mistake” to hire Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, for advice on working with the Trump administration.

AT&T paid Essential Consultants LLC, a firm set up by Cohen, a total of $600,000 over 2017 for advice on working with the Trump administration. AT&T said Cohen and others were hired to help navigate “a wide range of issues,” including its proposed $85 billion merger with Time Warner Inc , AT&T said in the memo seen by Reuters.

The disclosure of AT&T’s relationship with Cohen has turned into a major embarrassment for the telecommunications company as it awaits a U. S. judge’s decision, due June 12, on whether it can go through with the purchase of Time Warner, a deal that has been denounced by Trump.

AT&T said in the memo it did not hire Cohen to lobby on its behalf. The one-year contract at $50,000 per month, ran from January through December 2017 and was limited to consulting and advisory services.

AT&T never asked Cohen to set up meetings with anyone in the Trump administration, and he did not offer to do so, it said in the memo.

“To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate,” AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson wrote in the memo. “But the fact is our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment.”

Stephenson said in the memo he took responsibility for the Washington team’s failure to vet Cohen.

AT&T’s head lobbyist, Bob Quinn, who oversaw the hiring of Cohen, is retiring, according to the memo. But two sources familiar with the situation said Quinn was forced to retire.

The sources wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. Quinn did not respond to a request for comment.

AT&T’s board of directors does not hold Stephenson responsible for the lack of vetting, according to one source.

The AT&T payments were first revealed by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who also said a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and other corporations paid Essential Consultants for certain services. Avenatti would not say how he obtained the information.

Drugmaker Novartis  said on Wednesday it had a $1.2 million contract with Cohen’s firm, but soon realized the agreement was a mistake.

Essential Consultants paid $130,000 to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, days before the 2016 presidential election as part of a nondisclosure agreement that barred her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. He denies any encounter took place.

7,1,0.0,"The Stormy Daniels lawyer who tweeted bombshell allegations this week against Trump attorney Michael Cohen is now facing questions about his own business dealings — as well as how he obtained Cohen's bank records.

Since Michael Avenatti cited financial records to accuse Cohen of receiving $500,000 from a Russian oligarch-tied company — and other media outlets detailed that and other transactions — a frenzy has erupted over Cohen’s dealings at the dawn of the Trump administration. The records suggest Cohen's firm was paid huge sums for insight into the Trump administration.

AT&T and pharmaceutical giant Novartis, both of which paid Cohen's firm, also said this week they had been questioned by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team about their relationship with him. The lawyer is under investigation, in part over a $130,000 payment to Daniels in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with President Trump a decade ago.

But Avenatti has also faced scrutiny over his business dealings.

Recently, a complaint was filed against him to the California State Bar Association regarding his role in purchasing Tully's Coffee several years ago through an entity called Global Baristas.

The complaint, first obtained and reported by The Seattle Times, was filed by attorney David Nold of Bellevue, Wash. The complaint says Avenatti and Global Baristas faced a lien for unpaid federal taxes worth roughly $5 million, claiming taxes were withheld from workers' paychecks but not paid to the government. The complaint from Nold, as posted by The Seattle Times, called into question Avenatti's “fitness to practice law.”

Since the coffee chain purchase, Tully's has shuttered its stores (though the closures were described as temporary) as Global Baristas has dealt with numerous lawsuits.

The paper trail for that deal is maddeningly complex.

Fox News obtained a copy of the notice of federal tax lien in question, sent to “Global Baristas US LLC” and “Michael J Avenatti MBR [member].”

But Avenatti reportedly says he thinks Global Baristas has paid the outstanding taxes. Further, Avenatti claimed to Fox News that he wasn't a “member” of Global Baristas US LLC -- but rather the entity that owned it, Global Baristas LLC.

“The federal tax lien is related to an entity that was owned by another company that I used to have an interest in,” Avenatti told Fox News Thursday. “At no point in time was I ever responsible for any taxes for Global Baristas US LLC, nor was I ever a member of that entity, nor did I own any direct interest in that entity.”

However, a 2017 court document posted by The Seattle Times shows Avenatti acknowledging he was the ""principal"" of Global Baristas US LLC.

Avenatti, though, strongly disputed the complaint itself in an email to Fox News, calling it “complete and utter nonsense” filed by an “unethical lawyer who was recently held in contempt of court.""

Nold told Fox News in an email that this is ""just Avenatti being Avenatti.""

""The court ruled that I should not have given the full Avenatti deposition transcript to the news media,"" Nold said. ""The court found nothing wrong with sending the bar complaint.""

Fox News attempted to resolve their dueling claims by contacting the State Bar -- but a spokesman said they could not comment on ""confidential"" filings.

Meanwhile, another lawsuit was filed back in 2013 against Avenatti by his famous business partner, Patrick Dempsey of “Grey’s Anatomy” Dr. McDreamy fame. Dempsey's complaint against Avenatti, which was settled quickly, alleged Avenatti had not fully financed the coffee chain as agreed.

Avenatti no longer has any interest in either Global Baristas entity.

The attorney was surely the lesser known partner in that Tully's deal.

But since then, he's rocketed to national fame with his representation of adult film star Daniels -- and is still causing controversy.

While Cohen faces scrutiny from federal investigators and the media over his financial transactions, the disclosure of the Cohen bank records has drawn the feds' attention. The Treasury Department’s Office of the Inspector General said Wednesday that it was ""inquiring"" into claims that the information was ""improperly disseminated.""

Inspector general counsel Rich Delmar said the agency’s investigation stemmed from its authority as the federal agency that analyzes banking records for potential illegal activity. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, financial institutions must monitor their customers’ activities and report suspicious transactions to the government. But that information is supposed to remain confidential.

An OIG official said the inquiry was “predicated” on a New York Times story, which cited transactions first publicized by Avenatti and confirmed some of the information.

In their own court filing, Cohen’s attorneys Stephen Ryan and Todd Harrison accused Avenatti of making false accusations, and publishing “numerous incorrect statements to the public in an apparent attempt to prejudice and discredit Mr. Cohen.”

In a letter to federal Judge Kimba Wood, who is overseeing the Cohen case, Ryan and Harrison wrote that some of the information Avenatti published did appear to come from Cohen’s actual bank records and claimed that their client “has no reason to believe that Mr. Avenatti is in lawful possession of these records.”

“[Avenatti] should be required to explain to this Court how he came to possess and release this information,” they wrote.

Cohen's attorneys also claimed that Avenetti had incorrectly linked at least five wire transfers to their client. In two cases, they said the money was received by different Michael Cohens -- one residing in Canada and another in Israel.

When asked to respond to Cohen’s attorneys, Avenatti told Fox News that their filing was “comical and baseless.”

MICHAEL COHEN TEAM SAYS SOME OF AVENATTI'S CLAIMS ARE ABOUT OTHER MICHAEL COHENS

“We have done nothing wrong and the best thing they can point to is claiming that a mere $25,000 worth of transactions out of $3 million that we detailed is inaccurate? What a joke,” Avenatti told Fox News on Thursday.

Cohen is under criminal investigation as part of a grand jury probe of his personal business dealings. The investigation is being led by the U. S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York.

Even before his Daniels representation, Avenatti was known as a hard-charging and effective attorney who employs ""unconventional"" tactics in his legal battles. In Avenatti’s early days, he worked at The Research Group, a political opposition research and media firm run by Democratic political operative Rahm Emanuel.

The latest politico raising questions about Avenatti is Mark Penn—a former top pollster for Bill and Hillary Clinton—who said Avenatti should say where he got the banking details and who's funding him.

“He wants to make the discussion all about where Michael Cohen, President Trump's personal attorney, got his money but, to have clean hands, Avenatti needs to come forward with exactly who is financing his operation, who his sources were for detailed banking information, and whether he really is an attorney solely representing Stormy Daniels or just using her as cover to wage a political operation,” Penn wrote in an op-ed for The Hill, further questioning “where and how” Avenatti got Cohen’s “detailed financial information—because he didn’t find it on Google.”

""He can’t be both an attorney and then participate as an officer of the court in trafficking illegally obtained information,"" he wrote.

Avenatti slammed Penn in response, calling his column ""ridiculous"" and saying there was ""nothing wrong"" in the release of Cohen's financial information. Further, he posted a statement saying the case is funded by Stephanie Clifford (a.k.a. Stormy Daniels) and crowdfunded donations collected online. ""[N]o political party or PAC is funding this effort. No left wing conspiracy group is behind this. And no big fat cat political donors are leading the charge. Get over it,"" he said.

On Tuesday, when initially asked how he obtained the documents he published, Avenatti told Fox News: “That’s my work product and will not be disclosed.”

He then asked: “Why is Michael Cohen refusing to provide the bank statements to the public if what we have asserted ... is not true?”

CBI has corroborated the survivor’s charge that BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar raped her at his homeThe central agency alleged that UP police kept MLA and some other accused out of the FIR as well as chargesheetThe police also delayed the girl’s medical examination, said an officerNEW DELHI: The CBI probe in the politically sensitive Unnao gang-rape case has corroborated the survivor’s charge that BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar raped her at his home in Uttar Pradesh’s Makhi village on June 4 last year while his female accomplice, Shashi Singh, stood guard outside the room.

Sources said while the survivor had consistently named Sengar, MLA from Bangarmau, UP, among those who violated her, local police kept the MLA and some other accused out of the FIR filed on June 20 as well as the chargesheet filed later.

The central agency has recorded the survivor’s statement before a magistrate under CrPC Section 164, in which she “stood by” the allegations. Statements recorded under CrPC Section 164 are admissible in court as evidence.

Two men were arrested for impersonating a senior CBI officers and demanding Rs 1 crore from BJP MLA from Bangarmau Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s wife Sangeeta for ensuring a clean chit to her husband in the rape case. Sengar is at present lodged in Sitapur jail.

The police, a CBI officer said, also delayed the girl’s medical examination and didn’t send the vaginal swab or her clothes to the forensic laboratory. “This was all deliberate and in connivance with the accused persons,” he added.

Sengar, Shashi Singh and the other accused, who were arrested by the CBI on April 13-14, were questioned at length and the agency is tying up the loose ends related to the police’s involvement in saving the MLA.

The UP government had handed over the case to the CBI following an uproar over the alleged effort by the Unnao police to save the BJP MLA.

Describing the sequence of events in 2017, as established by the CBI based on the survivor’s statement and independent investigation, an agency source said, “The girl was raped on June 4 by the MLA after she was brought to his house by Shashi Singh on the pretext of providing her a job. Between June 4 and June 10, the girl didn’t speak as she had been threatened. On June 11, she was abducted by three persons — Shubham Singh, Awadh Narayan and Brijesh Yadav. From June 11 till 19, the girl was kept mostly in an SUV and repeatedly gang-raped by these three while on the move.”

When the girl was finally found on June 20, some officers at the local police station in Makhi (Unnao) were “reluctant” to register an FIR. When they eventually registered one, they left out Sengar, Shashi Singh and a few others from it.

Again, when a chargesheet was filed in August, the police named only the three men — Shubham, who is Shashi Singh’s son, Awadh and Brijesh.

“So, the UP police were right in claiming that the names of the MLA and Shashi Singh were not there in the FIR filed by the girl on June 20. But what it did not disclose was that the survivor’s complaint was diluted by UP police,” the CBI source said.

The UP police acted only recently, when state DGP O P Singh ordered the suspension of the deputy superintendent of police, the local SHO and four constables. The CBI is investigating the role of the DSP, SHO and others at the police station.

9,1,,"An analysis of Sean Hannity’s real estate holdings found that he used evictions and eviction threats against poor to generate revenue for his business.

The Washington Post reported:

Some of the court files include notes showing that sheriff’s deputies removed residents. More often, though, tenants who were taken to court avoided eviction by paying their past-due rent along with hundreds of dollars in late fees and other costs, records show. The Post found that property managers repeatedly filed eviction actions against many of those residents.

Told of The Post’s findings, three experts said the pattern suggests that the threat of eviction is being used not just to remove tenants but also to generate revenue.

“When they are serially filing against the same tenants, they are using the courts as collection agencies,” said Susan Reif, head of the Eviction Prevention Project at the publicly funded Georgia Legal Services Program. “It appears they are just trying to increase their profit margin by demanding fees under the threat of being evicted from your home.”

A light is being shined on who fake populist Sean Hannity really is, and he is more Donald Trump than the outraged common man that he plays on television. It isn’t a surprise that Trump’s top media cheerleader has the same lack of empathy and compassion that characterizes the president.

Sean Hannity is making money by threatening to kick poor and working-class people out of their homes. The same people that Hannity appeals to on a nightly basis as real Americans are who he is shaking down during the day.

Hannity is an even worse human being than you already thought he was.

Crooks was running unopposed for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the state Legislature.

Crooks initially went public with her claims against Trump ahead of the 2016 election. In February of this year, The Washington Post reported a detailed account of her story.

President Trump denied Crooks' claims after The Post's report published, tweeting: ""A woman I don't know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security cameras running.""

Crooks responded to Trump through her campaign's Twitter account, where she urged the President to release any footage from the encounter.

16,1,,"Lolade Siyonbola’s exasperated message to the campus police officers — and to the Yale University graduate student who’d summoned them to her dorm — was simple and consistent:

She didn’t have to do anything to prove that she was justified in being there, just because she happened to be black.

“I deserve to be here. I pay tuition like everybody else,” an annoyed Siyonbola told responding officers after they repeatedly asked her to hand over identification. “I’m not going to justify my existence here.”

It was part of a tense, racially tinged exchange that the African Studies student had this week with four police officers and the graduate student who called 911 after she found Siyonbola napping in the Hall of Graduate Studies’ 12th-floor common room.

The Monday encounter, broadcast by Siyonbola on Facebook Live, has roiled the campus community, sparking campus leaders to call for more conversations about inclusiveness. The nation is also engaged in a dialogue about disparate treatment of minorities in public places after black people who have not committed crimes have controversially had the police called on them at an Alabama Waffle House, Philadelphia Starbucks and Pennsylvania golf course.

And for anyone keeping score, it adds “napping” to the long and apparently still growing list of things it is unacceptable to do while black.

Other entrants include: couponing while black, graduating too boisterously while black, waiting for a school bus while black, throwing a kindergarten temper tantrum while black, drinking iced tea while black, waiting at Starbucks while black, AirBnB’ing while black, shopping for underwear while black, having a loud conversation while black, golfing too slowly while black, buying clothes at Barney’s while black, or Macy’s, or Nordstrom Rack, getting locked out of your own home while black, going to the gym while black, asking for the Waffle House corporate number while black and reading C. S. Lewis while black, among others.

Siyonbola is a first-year graduate student in the African Studies department at Yale. She had papers and books spread out in a common room while writing a paper Monday, but had flipped off the lights and went to sleep, she explained in her Facebook Live video.

Another graduate student, Sarah Braasch, walked in, turned on the lights and said she was calling police. The common room was off-limits for sleeping, she added.

[She wanted to criticize Black Lives Matter in a college speech. A protest shut her down.]

What followed was a racially tinged, police-involved dispute between neighbors that aired lived on Facebook — then spread.

Agitated, Siyonbola went to Braasch’s room, aiming a cellphone camera at her, and demanded to know why she had called the authorities.

“I have every right to call the police,” Braasch said after snapping a photo of Siyonbola. “You cannot sleep in that room.”

“Continue,” Siyonbola said, then taunted her. “Get my good side.”

Instead, Braasch shut the door and Siyonbola waited for the police, who became the subject of her second live video.

“Once we verify that you belong here, we’ll be on our way,” an officer said. The officer told Siyonbola that he doesn’t know either woman, is simply trying to quickly sort out what’s going on and needs to check her identification.

Ultimately, but unhappily, Siyonbola relented. She did not immediately respond to Washington Post messages seeking comment.

As the police tried to sort out who she was (Siyonbola’s given name in a Yale database conflicted with her preferred name on the card, a spokesman said.), she told them Braasch had called police on her friend about three months ago “because he was in the stairwell and he was black.”

She claimed that she is facing the same kind of harassment, from Braasch and from the four police officers who responded to her non-crime.

Later, a supervising officer told Siyonbola that she wasn’t harassed, at least not by the officers.

“Every time there’s an interaction with police officers doesn’t mean there’s harassment,” the supervisor told her. Then the officers bid her good night.

“You have a good night,” she said. “I’m not going to have a good night after this.”

Braasch, a graduate philosophy student, could also not be reached for comment. She had reportedly deleted social media accounts or set them to private in the wake of the incident.

Kimberly M. Goff-Crews, Yale’s vice president for student life, said in an email to the university community that the officers admonished the student who called 911 and that “the other student had every right to be present.”

Goff-Crews said she had discussed the incident with other Yale leaders, trying to figure out “how we can work together to avoid such incidents in the future.” She said they were planning “listening sessions” with the Yale community and encouraged students to share their thoughts.

The issue is, of course, much bigger than Yale. People have picketed coffee shops and received apologies from CEOs and college presidents over viral issues of bias that spread at the speed of the Internet, giving institutions an instantaneous black eye.

And with the “while black” incidents piling up, the aggrieved parties have begun to point out the similarities — sometimes in the very videos they post.

“Folks done made it okay to be publicly racist, and do and say what they want,” a tearful Kimberly Houzah said after being kicked out of a Victoria’s Secret in 2016.

Black people who had tense conversations with police said they felt as if their race made them more likely to be treated with suspicion by the white people around them. In some instances, they felt as though celebrating their blackness was being treated as a crime.

[After calling Barbara Bush an ‘amazing racist,’ a professor taunts critics: ‘I will never be fired’]

Nafeesah Attah, who graduated too boisterously while black last week (she was shoved off a stage while trying to flash a sorority sign) told The Post that her incident “speaks to the bigger and larger issue of race relations in the United States at this time and making sure that black students feel comfortable at these universities.

“This is the time to highlight black excellence; instead we were treated like criminals at our very own commencement.”

In a post on her Facebook page a day after the incident, Siyonbola also acknowledged that other black people have endured similar treatment.

“Grateful for all the love, kind words and prayers, your support has been overwhelming Black Yale community is beyond incredible and is taking good care of me. I know this incident is a drop in the bucket of trauma Black folk have endured since Day 1 America.”

Then she invited anyone reading her post to share similar stories.

The videos have gone viral, prompting Braasch to delete her social media accounts and Yale to issue two statements directed to students.

Siyonbola has now issued a statement of her own about the situation to Yale News.

“The response from Dean [Lynn] Cooley has been terrible. I don’t remember receiving any sort of apology or anything from her the first time, and this time the email that she sent was very vague, just not decisive, it just wasn’t direct with what the actual issues are,” said Siyonbola. “Do you want black students at Yale or do you not want black students at Yale? If you do, then be very clear about taking decisive action so incidents do not continue to happen. We don’t want to wait for a fatality, we don’t want to wait for what happened at Harvard before actual action is taken on this.”

Lynn Cooley is the Dean of Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Yale. She issued a statement to students on Tuesday.

“Incidents like that of last night remind us of the continued work needed to make Yale a truly inclusive place. I am committed to redoubling our efforts to build a supportive community in which all graduate students are empowered in their intellectual pursuits and professional goals within a welcoming environment. An essential part of that effort must be a commitment to mutual respect and an open dialog.”

18,1,0.0,"The day after it was revealed Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen received $500,000 in payments from a financial firm linked to a Russian oligarch aligned with Vladimir Putin, Pro Publica reports another longtime Trump personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, also represented the very same Russian firm as recently as last year. Kasowitz says he has represented the private equity firm Columbus Nova since 2010; Columbus Nova operates as the U. S. investment vehicle for Renova Group, a financial company run by Putin ally, Viktor Vekselberg. Columbus Nova also happens to be founded and run by Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater. Vekselberg and Renova Group were both targeted by U.S. sanctions in April; Vekselberg and Intrater have been questioned by Robert Mueller.

It’s not completely clear the implications of the financial link between Vekselberg, Columbus Nova, and Kasowitz, but, at the very least, it shows an intimate business connection between the Trump World and the Kremlin-approved businesses. Columbus Nova told Pro Publica that its hiring of the pair of Trump lawyers was a coincidence. From Pro Publica:

Kasowitz’s work for Columbus Nova stretches back to at least 2010 in related cases filed in New York and Illinois. In Illinois, Fifth Third Bank sued Columbus Nova and several affiliated entities, alleging that they had caused the bank to lose tens of millions of dollars on loans to a life insurance financing program that was “permeated … by fraud and embezzlement.” In the New York case, Kasowitz and three other attorneys at his firm filed a separate suit alleging that it was Fifth Third Bank that had committed fraud and caused losses.

More troubling is the idea that a lawyer (Kasowitz), who was for a brief two-month period in 2017 in charge of the president of the United States’ legal defense in the Russia investigation, was on the payroll of a Putin-aligned oligarch just months before assuming that role. A spokesperson for Kasowitz told Pro Publica the litigation the lawyer was involved with settled in early 2017, but there is no public record confirmation of that fact. Kasowitz was ousted from Trump’s Mueller defense team in July 2017, but the New York Times reported in March that he was still in contact with Trump, who was considering bringing the lawyer back to his legal team in a larger role.

Video of the Yale incident has gone viral after it was posted to Facebook on May 8 by the graduate student. Yale has called the incident “deeply troubling” and reaffirmed the university’s commitment to addressing incidents of “racial bias, discrimination and harassment.”

Sarah Braasch, a 43-year-old studying for her Ph. D in philosophy at Yale, called police on Lolade Siyonbola, during an incident at the Connecticut university’s Hall of Graduate Studies. Siyonbola recorded her interaction with Braasch and the Yale Police officers who responded to the 911 call. According to the Yale Daily News, this week’s incident was not the first time Braasch reported a black student for being in her hall. Jean-Louis Reneson, told the newspaper that he filed a complaint against Braasch in March after she called the police on him because she did not believe he was a student after he came to the building for a meeting with Siyonbola and other students.

Braasch could not be reached for comment by Heavy. Here’s what you need to know about her and the incident:

The incident happened on Tuesday, May 8, at 1:40 a.m., Yale University Police Chief Ronnell Higgins said in a statement. A woman called police to say that she was a student and there was a woman sleeping in the common room on the 12th floor of the Hall of Graduate Studies. Higgins said the caller told police she didn’t know who the person was. Officers responded at 1:45 a.m. and met with the caller, who showed them her ID. She then let them up in the elevator and they stopped at the 5th floor, where the other student appeared.

“At this point, the caller pointed to the other student and said ‘This is her,'” Protocol is for police to separate the parties involved, so two officers stayed with the woman on the fifth floor and the investigating officer went with the caller to the 12th floor,” Higgins wrote. “The investigating officer spent over 11 minutes initially with the caller to assess the situation, while the other two officers spent about 15 minutes with the other woman to assess the situation and to confirm her identity. After reviewing the scene in the 12th floor common room and seeing a computer, books and notebooks in addition to a blanket and pillow on the couch, the investigating officer determined that the person who had been sleeping in the common room was likely a student, so the officer asked the caller to wait in her room on the 12th floor.”

In the first video posted by Lolade Siyonbola, 34, who is set to graduate with a master’s degree in African studies in 2019, shows Sarah Braasch standing in the doorway of her room with a phone in her hand. Braasch can be seen taking photos of Siyonbola and then she tells her, “I have every right to call the police you cannot sleep in that room,” before taking more photos. Siyonbola wrote, “Sarah Braasch, Philosophy PhD student, called the cops on my friend a few months ago for getting lost in my building. Today she messed—again—with the wrong one.” You can watch the video below:

In a second video, Siyonbola, who had been studying for finals, can be seen interacting with the Yale Police officers who responded to Braasch’s call. In the second video, she can be heard telling the officers, “I deserve to be here. I paid tuition like everybody else. I am not going to justify my existence here. I am not going to be harassed.”

Siyonbola told the officers, “I was sleeping in the common room and [Braasch] comes in and turns the lights on and was like, ‘Why are you sleeping here? You’re not supposed to be sleeping here. I’m going to call the police.'” The officers requested her ID and eventually confirmed it after she reluctantly gave it to them. She also showed them that she had a key to open her apartment. “I really don’t know if there’s a justification for you even actually being in the building,” Siyonbola said in the video.

Higgins, the Yale Police chief, wrote, “The investigating officer reported what she found to the other two officers on the fifth floor and a supervisor who had arrived to assess the situation and determine whether assistance was needed. The officers were having a difficult time confirming the other student’s identification due to the use of a preferred name in the system that was different from the official name on the ID. The supervisor worked with dispatch and security to clear up the matter, taking down the student’s information and giving her a case number. The assessment of the ID took about 15 minutes, which is longer than usual.”

You can watch the video below:

Higgins wrote that after the ID issue was cleared up, “the investigating officer, with her supervisor, went to the 12th floor where they spoke to the caller again for another 7 minutes. Another officer also followed. They informed the caller that the student who had been in the common room was an authorized resident and had every right to be there. They also explained that this was not a police matter and were reporting the incident to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Officers left HGS Studies at about 2:34 a.m.”

Yale’s Vice President for Student Life, Kimberly M. Goff-Crews said in a statement. ” I am deeply troubled by an incident that took place Monday night in the Hall of Graduate Studies. One graduate student called the police to report another student in the common area, who had every right to be there. The Yale police officers who responded spoke with both parties and subsequently admonished the complaining student that the other student had every right to be present.”

Siyonbola told the Yale Daily News that the May 8 incident wasn’t her first run-in with Braasch. In February she invited a group of graduate students to her dorm for a meeting in the common room. Jean-Louis Reneson, a black grad student, told the Daily News that he got lost in the building when he arrived and was “physically blocked” from entering the common room by Braasch after he asked her for directions. Reneson and Siyonbola filed a complaint about that incident with Yale’s Associate Dean for Graduate Student Development and Diversity Michelle Nearon. The Daily News obtained a copy of that complaint.

Reneson said Braasch did not appear to think he was a Yale student and accused him of being an intruder. “Feeling ignored, I went down to the base of the twelfth floor and eleventh floor and turned my back, but she continued to verbally assault me from the twelfth floor claiming that I ‘didn’t belong here’ and I was making her ‘uncomfortable,’” Reneson told the newspaper. He said Braasch left and Reneson went to the meeting, but four officers soon showed up to investigate a “suspicious character.” They quickly established Reneson was a student invited to the building by Siyonbola and left, the newspaper reports.

Yale Graduate School Dean Lynn Cooley said in an email to students on Wednesday, “Incidents like that of last night remind us of the continued work needed to make Yale a truly inclusive place. I am committed to redoubling our efforts to build a supportive community in which all graduate students are empowered in their intellectual pursuits and professional goals within a welcoming environment. An essential part of that effort must be a commitment to mutual respect and an open dialog.”

Goff-Crews said in her message to graduate students that she will be holding listening sessions along with Yale’s police chief and Cooley:

As Vice President for Student Life, I have worked with administrators, faculty and students to strengthen the resources available to address incidents of racial bias, discrimination, and harassment. This incident and others recently reported to me underscore that we have work to do to make Yale not only excellent but also inclusive. I strongly believe we must strive to create an environment that values equity and justice and in which all students are empowered to pursue their personal and professional goals — environment that is diverse, intellectually challenging, and broadly welcoming. Over the last 48 hours, I have been in discussion with Dean Lynn Cooley, Chief Ronnell Higgins, and other university staff, including Yale police, to better understand what exactly happened at HGS on Monday night, and how we can work together to avoid such incidents in the future.

We still have so much more to do.

Siyonbola graduated from the Univeristy of Missouri with a degree in computer science and worked in the tech industry in New York City before enrolling at Yale, according to the university’s website. “Lolade founded the Yoruba Cultural Institute and the Nollywood Diaspora Film Series and served as Arts & Culture Editor, then Editor in Chief of Applause Africa magazine. A spoken word artist, Lolade has  performed internationally and published her first book, Market of Dreams in 2012. At Yale, her research focuses on the relationship between migration on identity formation, particularly among millennial first-generation Americans, and the role that cultural devices like language, film and textiles play in the preservation of culture. Lolade is a Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellow,” Yale’s website states.

Siyonbola told the Yale Daily News, “The response from Dean Cooley has been terrible. I don’t remember receiving any sort of apology or anything from her the first time, and this time the email that she sent was very vague, just not decisive, it just wasn’t direct with what the actual issues are. Do you want black students at Yale or do you not want black students at Yale? If you do, then be very clear about taking decisive action so incidents do not continue to happen. We don’t want to wait for a fatality … before actual action is taken on this.”

Sarah Braasch is scheduled to complete her Ph.d in philosophy in 2020, according to Yale University’s website. The 43-year-old previously graduated from the University of Minnesota with two engineering degrees, aerospace and mechanical, and then graduated from Fordham Law School in 2009. She is a member of the New York State bar, according to Yale. After law school, Braasch worked for a human rights organization in France and also studied philosophy at San Francisco State.

“Her secularism and women’s rights advocacy (including with Ni Putes Ni Soumises in Paris, France) led her to obtain an MA in Philosophy, to address the sub-human legal status of the world’s women at the source, the philosophical foundations of law,” Yale’s website states. “Sarah is interested in applying game theory and cognitive science to the philosophical foundations of law, including international law.  This endeavor encompasses her interests in practical reasoning and social ontology, as well as perceptual and social cognition, including language acquisition.”

On SF State’s website, where Braasch was a master’s candidate in philosophy, the school wrote, “Her graduating with two summa cum laude engineering degrees from the University of Minnesota, Sarah’s path wound its way into a career in the boutique hotel industry in LA and Miami.  Her 30th birthday brought into focus her desire to become an international human rights lawyer, with a focus on women’s sexual and reproductive rights.”

After law school, Braasch spent a year working for Ni Putes Ni Soumises (Neither Whores Nor Submissives), “a fierce women’s rights organization comprised primarily of women from the ghettoized Muslim immigrant communities surrounding France’s major cities.”

The SF State website says, “Her experience with NPS – which fights for universal human rights founded in secularism, gender equality and gender desegregation—alongside her work as a separation of church and state activist, developed her interests in philosophy of law.  During her doctoral studies, Sarah will continue her present work in the philosophical foundations of law to attack at the root the problem of the subhuman legal status of women.  She aspires to a lifelong career as a legal philosopher and women’s rights advocate.  She has recently been invited to present at the 9th International Symposium on Cognition, Logic, and Communication at the University of Latvia in Riga.”

Braasch has advocated for burqa bans in France and around the world, writing articles on the subject and protesting in the streets in Paris, including while wearing a burqa in front of the National Assembly.

“I am a First Amendment lawyer and a staunch church-state separatist. I surpass even my most progressive friends and colleagues in my unflinching and unwavering support of freedom of speech and expression, including religious expression,” she wrote in 2010 for the Freedom From Religion Foundation. “I support the anticipated public burqa ban in France, and I would support a public burqa ban in the U. S. In fact, I would support a global public burqa ban. (I will pause briefly for what I am sure are many gasps of incredulity.) … To me, the issue of whether or not the burqa/niqab is mandated by Islam is irrelevant. To me, in this instance, Islam is irrelevant. We don’t make laws based on Islamic doctrine or scripture or apocrypha or tradition or custom. We make laws based on secular principles and concerns and objectives. Likewise, Ni Putes Ni Soumises fights on behalf of secularism, gender equality and gender desegregation as the foundational elements of a truly egalitarian public space, in which all citizens participate as equals.”

She added, “Having turned my (nonexistent) soul inside out, looking for ulterior motives, I am comfortable with my stance on the burqa/niqab ban. It is a straightforward issue of public safety and security, coupled with democratic representation. Don’t let the discourse be hijacked by the cultural relativists and the obscurantists. That this seemingly benign issue gets so much media and political play is a direct result of our continued and ugly perception of women’s bodies as communal property.”

Braasch has also fought against hate crime laws. “I am pretty much the only person I know who hates hate-crime legislation as little more than bald-faced thought-crime legislation. I am not infrequently verbally vilified for asserting the claim that morality has no place in the law,” she wrote in the 2010 article. In 2011 she wrote a piece on Daylight Atheism titled, “Be Careful What You Wish For (Why I Hate Hate Crimes Legislation, But I Love Hate Speech).” She started her article with an anecdote about seeing a woman in a niqab on the UC Berekely campus, calling it “barbarism,” “brazen” and “a great shame,” and writing, “My views on public anti-mask laws (burqa bans, colloquially) as both public safety and gender desegregation measures are well known. We can no more tolerate gender segregation in the public space than we can tolerate racial segregation in the public space, above and beyond the simple fact that we can neither protect nor prosecute those whom we cannot identify, creating an untenable public safety and security hazard.” She said she wrote about that incident on Facebook and was accused of some of committing a hate crime against Muslims with her opinion.

For the rest of my life, if I should ever get into any kind of a dispute or altercation with anyone who claims to be Muslim, I could conceivably be prosecuted for a hate crime. My vehement anti-religion, and especially anti-Islam, ramblings on facebook, my personal blog, the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s website, and Daylight Atheism could be used against me in a court of law.

Hate crimes legislation is stupid. Seriously stupid. Abominably stupid. I hate hate crimes legislation. But, I love hate speech. Hate crimes legislation has a chilling effect on free speech and freedom of association. This is why hate crimes legislation is in direct contravention of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. Under hate crimes legislation, anyone who has ever said anything, which might be deemed hateful, directed at one of the groups protected under the legislation, opens themselves up to hate crimes prosecution in perpetuity, if they should ever find themselves in a dispute or altercation with someone who claims membership in any of those aforementioned protected groups. I want the haters out in the open, in the disinfecting sunlight of free and open discourse in the public marketplace of ideas. When people feel like their voices aren’t being heard, that’s usually when violence erupts. Thus, the paradox of hate crimes legislation. Hate crimes legislation couches the criminal penalty for hate speech within a crime of violence. But, in my opinion, nothing moves one to violence so much as being denied the right to speak one’s mind.

Hate crimes legislation is thought crime legislation. Hate crimes legislation criminalizes the motive behind a crime. Criminalizing the motive is criminalizing the why. Criminalizing the motive is criminalizing thoughts. A hate crime is an additional penalty, above and beyond the penalty imposed for whatever crime of violence. It is an additional penalty to punish the perpetrator for his/her motive. It is an additional penalty to punish the perpetrator for his/her thoughts, for his/her reason for having acted violently. This is thought crime. Pure and simple.

She also wrote about her view that race does not exist. “Human beings are real. Social groups aren’t. Not nations, not religions, not ethnicities, not cultures, and not races. Group identity is inherently arbitrary and illusory and fluid. There is no objective definition of a social group,” she wrote. “The experience of being a self-identified member of a social group is a wholly personal and subjective experience, which only exists in the mind of one or another group member.”

And in her Daylight Atheism article, she said, “There are a handful of misogynistic Islamists who occasionally try their hand at debating me on such subjects as US constitutional law and abortion rights on my NPNS facebook page. There’s little I enjoy more than publicly humiliating them online. In truth, I owe them no small amount of gratitude. Every time they bait me, and I engage them, my readership jumps precipitously. And, I relish the opportunity to vent a little of my barely contained rage.”

A post Braasch wrote in 2010 on The Humanist has also drawn attention after the Yale video went viral. In that post, Braasch wrote about winning a middle school debate by arguing the pro-slavery side:

I was placed on the pro-slavery side of the argument. I remember spending many an hour in the local public library poring over Time Life books. (The late 1980s were still a pre-Internet age.) It was during this period that I developed an insatiable appetite for history and began to devour history books of all shapes and sizes, as fast as I could read them. I thought that I would be able to unlock the mystery of human civilization, to gain a complete understanding of the world around me, and to peer far into the future of humankind. As an almost inexorable result, this was also when I began to loosen the tethers and fetters of religion from my wrists.

I read about the trials and tribulations of both escaped and freed slaves. I read about the cruel world waiting to pounce mercilessly upon penniless, illiterate, and uneducated former slaves. About how former slaves were torn from the stability of family and community and the paternalism of the slave owner (including the legal protections afforded slaves). About how former slaves struggled to rebuild their lives in a world that didn’t want them.

And then I had a eureka moment. Some—not many, but some—of the slaves didn’t want to stop being slaves. A small number wanted to remain with their owners or return even after being freed.

Braasch wrote that she realized she had won the debate with that argument.

“And indeed, I did. I led our team to victory,” she wrote in the 2010 post. “The pro-slavery contingent defeated the abolitionists because, in a democracy, in the land of the free, who are we to tell people that they can’t be slaves if they want to be? Who are we to tell someone that she has to be free? Who are we to tell someone that she has to be regarded as fully human? It doesn’t matter that the alternative to slavery, which would mean walking away from everything one had ever known to recreate life anew without any resources, was regarded as healthier and more dignified. It was still the individual’s choice to make.”

In a 2009 post on The Humanist site,  she wrote, “the thing that I like the most about genealogy is that once you go back a handful of generations you realize that social constructs like racism and tribalism seem downright silly.”

Braasch is a Minnesota native and has also lived in Wisconsin. She grew up in the Jehovah’s Witness faith and has written about how that experience impacted her anti-religion views. She said she has been estranged from her mother for more than 20 years because she left the religion. In her 2010 piece on The Humanist, Braasch compared her religious upbringing to being a slave.

“I was a slave who extolled the virtues of being a slave. I was a slave who insisted that I had chosen slavery of my own free will, of my own volition, as a conscious and educated choice. Because, you see, I was a Jehovah’s Witness who had been brainwashed from birth to believe that God had created me subhuman–below man,” she wrote. “I had been indoctrinated to accept this truth as part of God’s divinely ordained scheme for mankind (not humankind), to serve the men in my family and community, and nothing more. I had been inculcated to wait patiently for my post-Armageddon blessings in the hereafter or suffer the dire consequences in the here and now, including demonic attack.”

She added, “I decided that I didn’t want to hate myself anymore, no matter the cost. Even if it meant rejecting God’s plan for me. I chose to claim my humanity, my personhood, my human and civil rights. While I was still a teenager myself, I walked away from everything and everyone I had ever known. I made a new life for myself. A human life, not a subhuman, slave life. It was anything but easy and at times seemed like an impossible choice. I know that death and even suicide sometimes seemed easier. And now I think that maybe it shouldn’t have to be that hard to be human. Maybe we should make it a little easier to reject slavery.”

The debate of our time is again about abolishing slavery. But this time it’s about abolishing the slavery of women, usually in the context of religion. It’s the same debate that was held in my middle school social studies class: should women get to “choose” to be slaves in a secular, liberal, constitutional democracy? This time, however, I don’t want to argue for the pro-slavery contingent.

We have decided that we won’t let human beings choose slavery as a result of their skin color, but we permit women to do so in the context of religion. I have been dumbstruck and dismayed by the lengths to which even my ostensibly freethinking peers will go in defense of a woman’s “choice” to be a slave, especially with respect to the free exercise of religion. I chalk most of it up to our deeply rooted notions of women as the sexual and reproductive chattel of their families and communities. Most recently, this debate has reared its head in Western Europe in the form of proposed public burqa bans in France, Belgium, and Spain.

“As a devoted defender of the right to free speech, even I am willing to concede that freedom of expression isn’t unlimited. Compelling government interests may justify impinging upon fundamental rights and still lie within the constraints of constitutionality. Reasonable people can and do disagree about whether identity obscuring face coverings in the public space should be protected as free speech and in which contexts and to what extent. Ultimately, this is a question for legislators and courts,” Braasch continued. “Additionally, and personally, I would argue that women’s emancipation is a compelling government interest that justifies impinging upon the right to anonymous public speech (via an identity-obscuring face covering), if such a right exists. Gender equality and desegregation should be as compelling an interest to the government as diversity. (Unfortunately, American jurisprudence has yet to catch up with me on this point.) No liberal constitutional democracy can survive for long with a de facto multi-tiered hierarchy of citizenship. In other words, no one gets to ‘choose’ to be a slave.”

Articles by Braash, who deleted her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts after the video went viral, have been removed from The Humanist’s website. The site’s editors issued a statement saying, “We have removed Sarah Braasch’s article, ‘Original Intent’ (published in 2009), after finding it racially offensive. The article was a commentary on the Puritanical dogma and religious tyranny in colonial America, making the case that our nation was founded on principles antithetical to such oppression. However, the author’s interjection that racism is a ‘silly’ social construct renders this article out of step with our commitment to social justice and to the pressing need to be realistic about the racism that permeates our culture today. We regret not seeing this problem sooner and appreciate readers bringing it to our attention.”

The editors added, “We have removed the article “Lift the Veil, See the Light” by Sarah Braasch (published in the Sept/Oct 2010 issue of the Humanist magazine) from our website after it was brought to our attention that it contains racially offensive argumentation. The article was part of a point-counterpoint on the topic of laws barring Muslim women in France from wearing face-covering veils. In the article in question, which argues for the ban, the author equates the small number of slaves who wanted to remain with their owners after emancipation (an idea that is itself still a justification for racism in some circles) with women who choose to be “slaves” in abusive, misogynistic, or otherwise patriarchal religious traditions. She makes this analogy–which we have judged to be inaccurate and racially offensive–to argue that if human beings are forced or conditioned to accept indignity, suffering, and an inferior position in society then that society has an obligation to make laws to correct that. While the author’s final point is one some humanists might champion, the analogy to American slavery is definitely not.”

The statement said, “The Humanist published two articles from this author as an outside contributor (not a staff member or regular blogger). We regret that this material remained up as long as it did and appreciate its offensive content being brought to our attention.”

23,1,0.0,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, abruptly resigned from his law firm, Greenberg Traurig, the firm announced on Thursday, then promptly undercut his recent statements defending the president.

Mr. Giuliani had taken a leave of absence last month from the firm, one of the nation’s largest, to represent Mr. Trump. But the firm said in a statement that he no longer worked there.

Firm partners had chafed over Mr. Giuliani’s public comments about payments that another of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, made to secure the silence of a pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied her allegations.

Mr. Giuliani suggested that such payments were common at his firm, even without the knowledge of the clients. “That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do, out of his law firm funds,” he said on Fox News. He added, “Michael would take care of things like this like I take care of this with my clients.”

25,1,,"In the waning weeks of 2016, when the intelligence community and many politicians were passing around terrifying reports about Donald Trump’s links to Russia like samizdat, the frightening possibility arose that the sanctity of the United States government might be compromised in a way no living American had experienced. This was just one of the unnerving things about the rise of Trump, and it was one that many well-informed observers doubted. Russia, after all, was poor and weak. To imagine that a country with an economy smaller than Canada’s or Italy’s could leverage a superpower ten times wealthier beggared the imagination. And yet that paranoid, absurd belief seems to be creeping closer to reality than seemed possible even in those dark postelection days.

The New York Times has confirmed the explosive claims made by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, that Columbus Nova — a New York investment firm whose biggest client is a company controlled by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg — deposited half a million dollars into a secret account set up by attorney Michael Cohen to pay off Trump’s sexual partners. The possible reasons for this arrangement run from brazenly corrupt to far worse. Columbus Nova said the hefty sum was a “consulting fee” paid to Cohen, hardly a benign explanation.

5 of the Most Blatantly Unethical Moves by the Trump Administration

Columbus Nova reportedly retained Cohen’s services after Andrew Intrater, the company’s American chief executive, met him while attending Trump’s inauguration with Vekselberg, who is his cousin. Like all Russian oligarchs, Vekselberg operates in cooperation with the Putin government. The payments gave Russia several sources of possible leverage over Cohen and Trump. First, the money itself could amount to some kind of bribe, in return for which a favor would be expected. Second, Russia had knowledge of the secret payoff, which it could always expose. Third, the possibility (at minimum) exists that Russia knew the account was being used to silence Trump’s mistresses, yet another source of kompromat.

For all the speculation about the existence of the pee tape, the latest revelations prove what is tantamount to the same thing. Russia could leverage the president and his fixer — who, recall, hand-delivered a pro-Russian “peace plan” with Ukraine to Trump’s national-security adviser in January 2017 — by threatening to expose secrets they were desperate to keep hidden. Whether those secrets were limited to legally questionable payments, or included knowledge of sexual affairs, is a question of degree but not of kind.

Perhaps even more alarming has been the response of the political system to this crisis. The House of Representatives has assigned Devin Nunes, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, as its point man to defend Trump against the Mueller investigation. The Department of Justice has a long-standing policy of keeping Congress out of active investigations, for the obvious reason that elected officials have a powerful incentive to interfere. Nunes has demanded the virtually unlimited right to get inside the Mueller probe. Officials in the Department of Justice have come to suspect his goal is to compromise the investigation by handing information from the prosecutors over to Trump.

The Washington Post tonight reports another, and even more fanatical, step in Nunes’s crusade. Last week, Nunes demanded a piece of information that the FBI and other intelligence officials believed would “endanger a top-secret intelligence source.” They prevailed on Trump to support their request to withhold the information which, they argued, would “risk severe consequences including potential loss of human lives.”

Nunes is not only demanding the secret be revealed to him, but threatening to vote to hold Attorney General Jeff Sessions in contempt. And officials who secured Trump’s support may have left out the fact that the source provided information to the Mueller investigation. As a result, “several administration officials said they fear Trump may reverse course and support Nunes’s argument.”

Think for a moment what this report tells us. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who enjoys the full backing of his party’s leadership, is willing to risk what his own government describes as the betrayal and potential loss of life of an intelligence source. And officials within this government believe the president would do the same, all in order to obstruct an investigation into the president’s secretive ties to a foreign power. They are acting as though Trump is compromised by Russia, or at the very least, that he cannot be trusted to defend his own country’s security against it. The sordid Russia scandal has already brought some version of a very dark nightmare scenario to life.

Matt Erickson, a failed 2016 GOP candidate, created a snow business called Snow Angels that promised customers he would remove snow from their yards up two inches or more.

However, throughout 2017-2018 his company received several complaints. People would request and pay for his services, and then he would disappear.

His customer base was made up of people 60 or older. The Wisconsin Department of Justice filed federal charges against him for ripping people off.

One complaint read:  “Despite several instances of snowfall of two inches or more during the months of December 2017, January 2018, and February 2018, Erickson/Snow Angels had not provided any snow removal services.”

According to the investigator Erickson earned nearly  $360,000 by scamming elderly people.

Erickson now faces three criminal theft charges, two felonies, and three counts misdemeanors.

Ajit Pai's FCC wants to let cable companies control which websites and apps you use, where you get your news, how you listen to music and watch videos -- everything you do on the Internet. But the US Senate will vote in mid-May on a resolution to block the FCC's repeal of net neutrality and keep the web free and open. Starting May 9th through the vote itself, we're calling on websites and social media users to ""go red"" as part of our Red Alert for Net Neutrality to help sound the alarm. Join us!

Contact Congress now to show your support for net neutrality. Below you'll find a list of your state's senators and representatives. The ones in green support net neutrality, so let them know you appreciate their support. The ones in red need to be convinced, so let them know how important this issue is to you. Then target the 49 undecided senators. Once we win the Senate, the fight moves to the House, where we need over 25 Republican votes to win.

This would amount to a tax on every sector of the American economy. Every site would cost more, since they'd all have to pay big cable. Worse, it would extinguish the startups and independent voices who can't afford to pay. If we lose net neutrality, the Internet will never be the same.

36,1,,"The Senate Intelligence Committee revealed Tuesday that Russian hackers — who are known to have penetrated at the electronic election systems of at least 18 states — were in a position to ""alter or delete"" voter registration data ahead of the 2016 election at least some states.

The report, released Tuesday night, does not say which states were vulnerable to this kind of manipulation; it only says that it occurred in a ""small number of states."" And while it says that the hackers were ""in a position"" to carry out this tampering, it doesn't say if there's evidence that any registration files were altered.

It goes on to note that the hackers ""did not appear to be in a position to manipulate individual votes or aggregate vote totals."" While it's certainly a good thing that the hackers were unable to change vote tallies, it's a small comfort. To alter an election result, removing names from voter registration files would be sufficient if your method was well-targeted. As long as you can reliably predict how a certain group of people will vote, then removing them from the voter rolls would have the same effect as altering the vote tallies after the fact.

President Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly downplayed the effect of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and they have frequently cited the fact that there's no evidence final vote tallies were altered as vindication for Trump. They rarely address other ways in which the final election result may have been duplicitously affected.

It remains unclear to what extent upcoming U. S. elections will be protected from these or other types of attacks. With Trump uninterested in countering Russian aggression or investigating the meddling that occurred in 2016, it's likely that the country will be less prepared to protect itself than it otherwise would be.

37,1,,"Why do all the facts about Elliott Broidy’s (supposed) affair with Shera Bechard point to Donald Trump?

On May 2, Rudy Giuliani revealed that the Trump administration has been lying for months about the fact that Donald Trump reimbursed his personal attorney Michael Cohen for the $130,000 he fronted to buy porn star Stormy Daniels’s silence about her affair with Trump. Until then, Trump had been claiming that he didn’t know about any settlement, and that he hadn’t had a sexual liaison with Daniels. (The official White House line continues to be that Daniels is lying about having sex with Trump, but almost no one believes this.) Giuliani has claimed that Trump gave him the okay last week to contradict several months’ worth of denials, by revealing Trump’s payments to Cohen.

In journalism this is known as getting out in front of a story. After federal law-enforcement officials raided Cohen’s office on April 9, they surely had documentary evidence of these financial transactions, which meant it was inevitable the truth would eventually come out.

We should consider the strong possibility that the same tactic — i.e., shameless, baldfaced lying — may have played a role in the exposure of yet another Trump-related sex scandal. The Wall Street Journal published a story on April 13 revealing the existence of another nondisclosure agreement involving an affair between an adult entertainer and a client of Cohen’s. The NDA employed the pseudonyms David Dennison and Peggy Peterson — the same names used in the Stormy Daniels NDA — and was otherwise very similar to the Trump-Daniels agreement.

5 of the Most Blatantly Unethical Moves by the Trump Administration

According to this newly revealed NDA, Dennison agreed to pay Peterson $1.6 million, in exchange for Peterson’s promise not to reveal the affair or her claim that Dennison had impregnated her. This NDA, like the Trump-Daniels document, was negotiated by attorneys Keith Davidson, on behalf of Peterson, and Michael Cohen, on behalf of Dennison. Payments were also delivered through Essential Consultants LLC, the same LLC created by Cohen to facilitate payments in the Stormy Daniels deal.

Whatever source revealed the existence of this NDA to the Journal also disclosed that, according to another document in Cohen’s office, the Dennison in this agreement was not Donald Trump but rather Elliott Broidy, a top Republican fundraiser, while Peterson was Shera Bechard, Playboy’s Miss November 2010. Apparently, Bechard had been Broidy’s mistress until he got her pregnant, at which point she hired Davidson, who contacted Cohen to demand the payment of hush money.

By a stroke of good fortune, Cohen already had a sex-scandal-with-an-adult-entertainer-hush-money-NDA template in his hard drive, since he had recently drafted at least one for Donald Trump. Indeed, Cohen didn’t even bother to change the pseudonyms. (That economical use of attorney resources explained away what otherwise could have been a very awkward detail in the narrative.)

This is the story that was leaked to the Journal — and to the New York Times, and CNN, which the Journal beat to the punch by publishing it first. It has since been repeated as fact by just about every major media outlet in the country. But there are good reasons to consider whether it might not be yet another audacious lie from Trumpworld.

Let me offer an alternative explanation of the affair and the payoff. It is still just a hypothesis, but, I would argue, it fits more comfortably with what we know about the various players than the reported version of events: Donald Trump, not Elliott Broidy, had an affair with Shera Bechard. Bechard hired Keith Davidson, who had negotiated both Playboy playmate Karen McDougal’s deal with the National Enquirer and Stormy Daniels’s NDA with Trump. Davidson called Cohen, and the two of them negotiated a $1.6 million payment to Bechard.

At this point Cohen needed to find a funding source. Cohen asserts he took out a home equity loan to come up with a mere $130,000 to pay off Stormy Daniels, so it seems clear he couldn’t have fronted the $1.6 million for the Bechard deal himself. So Cohen reached out to Elliott Broidy, a very rich Republican fundraiser with several pending and highly lucrative business deals with foreign governments: deals that hinged on whether Broidy could convince the U. S. government to take various actions. By stepping up to take responsibility for the affair and to fund the seven-figure settlement, Broidy was ensuring that he could continue to peddle his influence with Trump to governments around the world.

Which is to say, it was a cover-up concealing a bribe. Indeed, it turns out that Broidy not only has a history of bribing public officials, but of bribing them in an uncannily similar fashion to the method which I hypothesize he employed in this case.

So, according to this hypothesis, when Cohen’s office was raided by federal prosecutors, they found documentation of what was actually a fabricated affair, concocted by Cohen and Davidson to create a justification for funneling Broidy’s money to Bechard, while creating a paper record designed to protect Trump from further exposure.

This account — as bizarre as it may seem at first glance — is actually more plausible than the story leaked to the Journal, the New York Times, and CNN.

We, of course, do not know what actually happened. But it is worth noting that, two weeks after the story broke, Michael Avenatti, the lawyer Stormy Daniels hired to replace Davidson, hinted to Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC that the real story might be quite different from that which had been reported so far: “I think at some point we are going to find out, if in fact the client in connection with the [$1.6 million] settlement was, in fact, Mr. Broidy,” Avenatti said. “I’m going to leave it at that.”

When I laid out the alternative scenario presented in this article to Avenatti, he had this to say: “There are considerable and serious questions as to this alleged settlement. Many things about it simply do not appear to add up or pass the smell test.”

Note too that this alternative account presents a narrative in which the behavior of all of the primary parties in this matter — Trump, Cohen, Broidy, and Bechard — is fundamentally consistent with their well-documented personal histories, unlike the story reported by the media.

The New David Dennison Sounds Exactly Like the Old Donald Trump

David Dennison slept with a Playboy playmate, impregnated her, and then had Cohen negotiate a hush-money deal. Trump has a well-documented history of having unprotected sex with women in the adult-entertainment industry, and then subsequently buying their silence via proxies. Trump also has a history of being obsessed specifically with Playboy playmates. Trump had a long-standing close friendship with Hugh Hefner, and often visited the Playboy mansion, to which he brought contestants from his television show The Apprentice. One such contestant noted:

Toward the end of the evening, I found myself in a small circle, conversing with Trump, Hefner, and another contestant. With a wry smile, Trump looked at Hefner and said, ‘It’s hard for me to tell which of these girls are yours and which ones are mine.’

Bechard was actually at one time Hefner’s girlfriend, while Trump and Hefner’s friendship mysteriously came to an end in 2016.

In November of 2016, it was revealed that McDougal, another Playboy model, had been paid $150,000 to sell her story of an affair with Trump to the National Enquirer, so that the tabloid, whose publisher is a major Trump supporter, could kill the story rather than publish it. McDougal was represented in this transaction by none other than Keith Davidson. (Davidson has since been fired by McDougal, Daniels, and Bechard, as all three women have apparently come to the all too plausible conclusion that Davidson was actually working with Michael Cohen to protect Trump, rather than independently representing their interests, as he was legally required to do after he accepted them as clients.)

While having sex with Playboy playmates might be a common enough fantasy among certain older married men, history suggests that the combination of reckless narcissism and personal shamelessness necessary to actually pursue it and then pay the various costs associated with fulfilling it is rarer. How many sex scandals involving Playboy playmates and men not named Donald Trump can you recall?

Elliott Broidy Seems Exactly Like Someone Who Would Pay $1.6 Million to Protect a Lucrative Influence-Peddling Business

Broidy has a history of bribing public officials to enhance the economic prospects of his business ventures. In 2009, he pleaded guilty to bribing New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi. As part of a plea deal which led to the convictions of seven of his co-conspirators, Broidy admitted he made more than $1 million in illegal payouts and gifts to New York pension authorities. The payoff for these bribes came when the New York State Retirement Fund invested $250 million with Markstone Capital, Broidy’s private equity firm. As part of the plea deal, Broidy also agreed to pay back $18 million in investment fees that the state pension fund had paid to Markstone.

Remarkably enough, as Andrew Prokop pointed out this morning, one of Broidy’s bribes even involved paying off the girlfriend of one of the officials he was bribing:

Elliott Broidy even has a history of paying off the girlfriend of the public official he is bribing. https://t.co/RkyYJGYTAG pic.twitter.com/pmt6mJa6o7— Andrew Prokop (@awprokop) May 8, 2018

Broidy paid over $90,000 to the girlfriend of a high-ranking [Office of the New York State Comptroller] official from April 2004 through October 2005. The payments were used to cover the girlfriend’s living expenses and rent. Broidy also covered the girlfriend’s hospital bills. Broidy also agreed to pay $5,500 a month to a relative of the girlfriend beginning in October 2003, for a total of $44,000. These payments were concealed through a sham loan agreement between Broidy and the relative.

In March 2018, the previously obscure Broidy was the subject of a slew of national stories regarding his remarkably aggressive influence-peddling in the wake of Trump’s election. For example, the Journal reported that Broidy was slated to make tens of millions of dollars by getting the Justice Department to drop a probe into a multibillion-dollar bribery scandal involving 1MDB, the Malaysian state investment fund. One email revealed a plan to pay Broidy and his wife $75 million if they could successfully lobby the DOJ to drop the probe into 1MBD.

A few days later, the New York Times published an extensive account detailing how Broidy was “marketing his Trump connections to politicians and governments around the world,” by, for example, “suggesting to clients and prospective customers of his Virginia-based defense contracting company, Circinus, that he could broker meetings with Mr. Trump, his administration and congressional allies.” Other stories detailed Broidy’s partnership with Trump-allied businessman George Nader, in which both men tried to influence White House policy in favor of Saudi Arabia and the U. A.E. (Nader has since become a co-operating witness in Robert Mueller’s independent counsel investigation.) According to these accounts, Nader dangled the prospect of more than $1 billion in contracts for Circinus before Broidy, as he assiduously cultivated Broidy’s influence with “the Chairman,” a.k.a. Donald Trump.

Who Is Shera Bechard More Likely to Date?

While Broidy’s business dealings are the epitome of the sort of swampy sleaze that Trump promised to drain from federal government decision-making, his home life is by contrast extremely stable, and, to all appearances, quite conventional. Broidy is 60 years old, and has been married for over 25 years to a woman of about his own age, with whom he has had three children. His wife is an attorney who was previously a senior vice-president at 20th Century Fox (she has reportedly been involved in some of Broidy’s more questionable business dealings). While of course it’s not impossible that Broidy chose to pursue a dangerous liaison with Miss November 2010, his biography is not that of a man who has the appearance of a likely candidate to have an affair with a Playboy playmate several decades younger than himself. He is not, in other words, a thrice-married serial adulterer with an established record of sleeping with models, playmates, and porn stars.

It Doesn’t Make Sense That Davidson Would Have Reached Out to Cohen

Several parts of the story leaked to the media make no sense at all. Consider Cohen’s involvement. The official story is that Davidson reached out to Cohen, who then contacted Broidy. Why in the world would Davidson tell Cohen about an illicit affair involving Broidy? Cohen was Trump’s lawyer, not Broidy’s. Cohen didn’t represent Broidy at that time and therefore had no duty of confidentiality or loyalty to Broidy (or Bechard for that matter). And the information that Broidy had an affair with Bechard was extremely sensitive, as Bechard was set to make seven figures for agreeing to keep that information private.

Spilling the beans to Cohen, who would then have been free to tell anyone else what Davidson had told him, would risk Bechard’s payoff in two ways. If Cohen failed to keep Broidy and Bechard’s affair confidential, the settlement value to Broidy of a potential nondisclosure agreement could have been greatly diminished or even completely destroyed. Also, Cohen merely knowing about Broidy’s supposed affair could have jeopardized both Broidy’s position as co-chair of the Republican National Committee’s finance committee — a position he actually shared with, of all people, Cohen — and his elaborate and ongoing influence-peddling with the government. (Someone who has had conversations with Davidson about this matter says that, according to Davidson, Broidy did not even know Cohen before he contacted him about Bechard.)

Simply put, Davidson communicating with Cohen about Broidy had no conceivable legal justification, and was profoundly counterproductive to Davidson’s client’s interest. In short, while it is possible that Davidson could have suggested to Broidy that he contact Cohen himself, given Cohen’s experience with sex scandal NDAs, the idea that Davidson unilaterally decided to tell Cohen about Bechard’s affair with Broidy is absurd on its face.

The Sum of the Settlement Is Fishy

The size of the payment to Bechard — $1.6 million — is also a little weird. Broidy was a largely anonymous person in late 2017, when the NDA was signed. His biggest claim to fame at the time was a felony conviction for corruption. Why would a man in his position need to pay $1.6 million to keep Bechard quiet about an affair to which the public at large would be completely indifferent? (And if the explanation for the massive payment is that Broidy was desperate to keep this secret from his family and the RNC, why, as detailed below, did he admit to the affair the very first time a journalist asked him about it?) Furthermore, according to the Journal, Bechard provided no proof to Broidy that she was pregnant by him, or indeed pregnant at all. Under these circumstances, a seven-figure hush-money payment seems hard to explain.

Consider that Trump and the National Enquirer collectively paid less than one-fifth of that amount to keep both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal quiet about affairs with a major-party presidential candidate.

By contrast, while it seems unlikely that Broidy would pay $1.6 million to hush up Bechard, it is eminently understandable that Trump would do so — or, more accurately, find someone else to. After all, by the time Bechard demanded payment for her silence Trump was already president. And, if anything could shake Trump’s crucial core support among Evangelical Christians, a brand-new affair (many of those supporters forgive Trump’s many previous sins on the grounds that he is now a “baby Christian”) with a Playboy playmate, who then aborted what these supporters would consider Trump’s unborn child, might produce that outcome.

Are We Really Supposed to Believe That Broidy Wanted Cohen to Represent Him?

Elliott Broidy is a very wealthy and legally sophisticated man, who has hired the best legal talent over the years to deal with his many complex business entanglements. Yet we are supposed to believe that, when he gets an out-of-the-blue phone call from Cohen, revealing that he somehow knows about Broidy’s affair with Bechard, Broidy’s reaction is to hire Cohen? That is, to retain a man who is barely even a lawyer, and who obviously has a disturbingly close working relationship with Bechard’s own attorney — rather than seeking top-shelf independent legal representation to deal with this serious personal and financial crisis? (The fact that Cohen has admitted in court that Broidy was his “client” is perfectly compatible with a narrative in which Broidy agreed to allow Cohen and Davidson to paper up the record with a fraudulent NDA.)

Broidy’s behavior following the raid is simply inexplicable. The current assumption is that Broidy knew that his payments to Bechard (through the LLC) would eventually become public, given that they were now in the possession of the Feds. But in fact, it was far from certain that they would. Cohen’s lawyers and Trump’s lawyers were fighting to keep Cohen’s attorney-client communications confidential, and it is quite possible that Broidy’s payments would never come to light. And even if they did, he could surely deny to the press that they were his. Broidy claims to have paid $1.6 million to keep his affair with Bechard quiet. Why throw away that entire investment at the first sign that this secret might eventually be exposed? By reacting in the manner he did, Broidy ensured that what was still at the time only a worst-case scenario became an immediate certainty, as opposed to remaining a down-the-line possibility.

If this theory is correct, the press bears some of the blame for allowing a self-serving and corrupt lie to enter the public record as news. At the bottom of this whole tangled situation, there are two undeniable facts: Trump has a habit of having sex with women exactly like Bechard, and then paying them off to stay silent, and Broidy is a man who pays large sums of money, legally and illegally, to influence powerful politicians. That convergence should have set off alarm bells in the minds of journalists when someone decided, immediately after Cohen’s office was raided, to reveal the existence of an NDA between Broidy and Bechard.

But those alarm bells apparently never went off in the offices of the WSJ, the Times, or CNN. And it’s easy enough to understand why: Broidy’s confession seemed, at least under the pressures of deadline journalism, like a classic example of what lawyers call an admission against interest, that is, a statement that should be treated as presumptively true.

But what if Broidy was actually faced with the choice of either falsely confessing to impregnating Bechard or, in the alternative, candidly confessing to having paid a seven-figure bribe to the president of the United States? That would certainly explain his otherwise remarkable willingness to instantly confess to a reporter the very secret he had supposedly paid so much money to keep out of the public eye.

What is most striking about this affair is that the story leaked to the media has no evidence to support it, other than the assertions of people who have every reason to lie about it. Consider what the narrative would look like if, when the story broke, the public had learned that Cohen’s office had a copy of another NDA, that provided for the payment of $1.6 million to a Playboy playmate to buy her silence about an affair, and that Broidy had agreed to pay that sum into the very same LLC that Cohen had created to funnel the money paid to hush up Trump’s liaison with Stormy Daniels. Would anyone believe Broidy’s after-the-fact protestations that, despite all appearances, he wasn’t paying off yet another of Trump’s mistresses, as a quid pro quo to his beleaguered patron? At a minimum, one would hope the veracity of Broidy’s confession would actually have been investigated. (According to the Journal’s story, Bechard claimed that Broidy had been paying her for an exclusive sexual relationship that lasted one to two years. Such an arrangement should be easy to document.)

Again, we do not know if this alternative account, or something like it, is true. What we do know is that the White House’s version of the story got into print without any apparent journalistic inquiry into whether that account was accurate, or an elaborate ruse. If it turns out that Trump had an affair with Bechard, and that Broidy paid a massive bribe to the president to help cover the affair up, this will prove to be another instance of the administration’s perverse ability to generate fake news about a scandal, in order to obscure the even more scandalous truth.

40,1,,"President Trump's decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran and  end the United States' participation in the 2015 nuclear deal  forces U. S. allies in Europe, China, Russia and Iran to decide what to do next.

Trump said Tuesday that the deal is a ""horrible, one-sided deal"" that ""didn’t bring peace"" and ""never will.""

Not re-issuing the waivers required under the nuclear agreement ""will have a devastatingly chilling effect on any kind of economic activity"" between Europe and Iran,"" said Tony Blinken, former deputy secretary of State under former president Barack Obama, who helped negotiate the deal.

It will take some time to re-impose the regulatory scheme that would be required to re-impose sanctions, said Robert Einhorn, a former arms control official at State under Obama's first secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.

The practical effect of not issuing the waivers is to put banks, businesses and purchasers of Iranian crude oil on notice ""that in the next 180 days, before November, they have to either stop importing Iranian crude oil or make significant reductions, up to 20% of Iranian crude oil,"" Einhorn said.

Trump campaigned against the Iran nuclear agreement, which he called the worst ever negotiated. He cited weaknesses in the deal that the leaders of France, Germany and Britain have acknowledged and pledged to improve. Those include:

• eliminating expiration dates on the most important restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity, which would allow Iran to resume large-scale processing of nuclear fuel starting in 2025;

•allowing inspections of military sites, which Iran currently disputes;

•and addressing its support for terrorist groups across the Middle East.

President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House last month and urged Congress to keep the deal and seek to improve it. German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Trump last week and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson met with Trump on Monday.

All urged Trump to stay with the deal and vowed to work with him to address his concerns. They agreed with U. S. intelligence agencies and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who testified that the agreement limited Iran's nuclear activities for now, and that Iran has complied with it.

Johnson went on Fox News to make his point.

""Iran has a tendency to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles. We've got to stop that. We’ve got to push back on what Iran is doing in the region. We’ve got to be tougher on Iran. We have to fix the flaws in the deal."" Johnson said Monday.

""We need to find a way of fixing that (deal), but you’ve got to do that without just throwing the baby out with the bathwater,"" he said.

While Iran's President Hasan Rouhani said that his country would respond to the U. S. action, he and other signatories to the deal have said they would seek to stay in it.

Russia, an crude oil exporter, doesn't import much if any crude oil from Iran. And China could direct its oil purchases through its Kunlun Bank, which is already under U. S. sanctions, Einhorn said.

The Europeans Union said Tuesday it plans to protect companies if Trump pulls out of the deal.

“We are working on plans to protect the interests of European companies” Maja Kocijancic, EU spokeswoman for foreign affairs, told reporters in Brussels, according to Bloomberg.

But Einhorn said that may be difficult for them to achieve.

""Virtually all banks and businesses will make the decision to pull out of Iran,"" he predicted. ""They can’t afford to duck out of the U. S.-led financial system.""

Banks and businesses are already wary of doing business in Iran because its economy is so poorly managed and corrupt, he said. ""Bit by bit, any economic gains that Iran was getting from the (nuclear deal) will dwindle away.""

Trump's ideal goal is to negotiate a better deal with Iran, said Stephen Rademaker, a former arms control official at State under then-president George W. Bush.

""Our president believes he is a negotiator,"" Rademaker told the House Foreign Affairs Committee Monday before Trump issued his statement.

Even after refusing to waive sanctions and those sanctions go back into effect, ""the president will still have the waiver authority,"" Rademaker said.

Trump said he still wants to negotiate.

""Iran’s leaders will probably say they refuse to negotiate a new deal,"" he said Tuesday at the White House. ""That’s fine I probably would say the same thing if I were in their position. The fact is they will want to negotiate a new deal.""

""When that happens I am willing and able,"" Trump said. ""Great things can happen for Iran.""

42,1,0.0,"Aides to President Donald Trump contacted a private Israeli intelligence agency to dig up dirt on negotiators of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal who worked in the Obama administration,  The Observer reported Sunday.

The aides contacted the firm days after Trump visited Israel during his first trip as president, sources told The Observer. During that trip, Trump promised Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu that Iran would never get nuclear weapons.

A source with knowledge of the ""dirty tricks campaign"" told The Observer: ""The idea was that people acting for Trump would discredit those who were pivotal in selling the deal, making it easier to pull out of it.""

Investigators were told to look into negotiators' careers, personal lives, and what contact they'd had with lobbyists and journalists, but its unknown how much, if any, work was undertaken.

At least two men who worked under the Obama administration were targeted according to The Observer: Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser, and Colin Kahl, deputy assistant to former President Barack Obama.

Both men told The Observer they were unaware of the campaign and Rhodes added that he was unsurprised by the ""chillingly authoritarian"" move.

But after reading The Observer report Kahl took to Twitter to relay a ""very creepy memory"" of a strange communication attempt by a woman claiming to be part of a UK equity firm in May last year.

According to Kahl, the woman contacted his wife to set up a personal meeting to discuss funding for their daughter's Washington DC elementary school. Kahl's wife told the woman, who had ""specific information"" about his wife to contact the school directly.

""My wife shared the email with me and a few people we know in both the finance and education fields. All agreed that the entire scenario seemed implausible and seemed like an approach by a foreign intelligence entity,"" Kahl said.

Around the same time aides began mentioning  Kahl and Rhodes in media reports.

Similar contact was made with Ann Norris, a former State Department official, who is also the wife of Ben Rhodes, in June 2017, according to  The New Yorker. A woman claiming to be part of a London-based film company said she wanted to consult with Norris about a movie she was working on, which followed the personal lives of ""government officials in the positions that determine war and peace."" The email aroused Norris' suspicion and she never responded.

The contact information for the two women do not work and their Linkedin pages were subsequently taken down, the New Yorker reported.

Investigators may have also contacted Iranian Americans as well as journalists who had reported favorably on the deal.

Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council, said he too was involved in a strange encounter, this time with someone who said he was a journalist.

""Things took a strange turn in the second part [of the interview], as this pretend journalist tried to goad me into agreeing that the Obama admin had pursued the nuclear deal for economic and financial reasons,"" Parsi tweeted.

""I didn't think much more of it until I was informed over the weekend that the gentleman in question was not a journalist, but an operative of this Israeli intelligence firm. That's upsetting enough, but the fact that this firm was hired by the Trump Administration to spy on and entrap US individuals and organizations, is beyond reprehensible.""

Sources told The New Yorker that the operation was carried out by Black Cube, an Israeli intel firm linked to the Mossad.

The firm carried out a  similar intelligence probe for Harvey Weinstein towards women who accused the mogul of sexual misconduct following an outpouring of allegations in 2016 and 2017.

Black Cube responded in a statement, saying: ""It is Black Cube's policy to never discuss its clients with any third party, and to never confirm or deny any speculation made with regard to the company's work,"" adding that they work within ""full compliance of the law.""

The company asserted that it has ""no relation whatsoever to the Trump administration, to Trump aides, to anyone close to the administration, or to the Iran Nuclear deal.""

A spokesman for the White House's national security council offered ""no comment"" to The Observer when asked about the report.

Trump will decide on May 12 whether or not the US will stay in the current nuclear agreement which limits Iran's nuclear program.
",1,2030,Trump aides reportedly hired an Israeli intelligence agency to dig up dirt on Obama's Iran deal team,http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-team-hired-israeli-intelligence-to-spy-on-obama-iran-deal-black-cube-2018-5,,
43,1,0.0,"Trump is pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, a decision which will further alienate the United States from its closest and longest-standing international allies.

The New York Times reports that Trump’s obsession with undoing the presidency of Barack Obama has led him to this point in his tenure, noting that Trump’s petulant action “lunges America’s relations with European allies into deep uncertainty.”

Apparently since they do not have ongoing envy and obsession with Obama, the other European nations who are a part of the deal will stay in it.

Trump also hands Iran “a propaganda win” by pulling out of the deal, giving Iran the upper hand over the United States while also allowing them to move toward creating a nuclear arsenal.

The Times notes that if Trump reimposes sanctions on Iran, it could cause those allies to be engaged in a “diplomatic and economic clash” with the United States.

Reigniting those sanctions will also lead to higher gas prices for average Americans, but Trump believes undoing a large part of Obama’s legacy is worth it.

U. K. foreign secretary Boris Johnson, acting on orders from prime minister Theresa May, recently appeared on Fox News and made a direct appeal to Trump not to “throw the baby out with the bathwater” and stick with the deal.

Johnson also wrote an op-ed in the New York Times begging Trump to stay with the deal.

French president Emmanuel Macron said withdrawing from the deal “would mean opening Pandora’s box, it could mean war.”

German chancellor Angela Merkel has also pushed for the Iran deal to be kept in place.

Hundreds of European lawmakers have written to Trump, noting in a joint document “We were able to impose unprecedented scrutiny on the Iranian nuclear program, dismantle most of their nuclear enrichment facilities, and drastically diminish the danger of a nuclear arms race.”

They have been pushing for him to keep the deal to preserve international security.

Former Israeli leader Ehud Barak, who has often been hawkish toward Iran, said it would be a “mistake” to drop out of the deal and would hurt negotiations with North Korea, who has continued to pursue nuclear weapons.

But Trump has been tearing America away from its allies and toward authoritarian regimes more in line with his own world view.

He praised authoritarians like Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, while calling Germany “evil, very evil.”

While the rest of the world committed to the Paris climate accords, Trump took America out, which generated international criticism and condemnation from citizens and leaders.

Approval of American leadership has plummeted under Trump, as he takes the country away from its traditional role toward a more isolationist approach.

The Iran deal was put in place to help international peace. It sought to keep nuclear weapons away from the ever-volatile cauldron of Middle Eastern politics.

World leaders understood the importance of doing so and were led by President Barack Obama to the historic agreement.

Now, simply because his failing presidency has none of the support Obama experienced, Trump is again upending the apple cart, even if that means condemning the world to war and turning away allies that have been with America since it was founded.

Nacka Port kommer att utgöra ett urbant levande sammanhang, med ett spännande och varierat innehåll.

De trappande sidorna innehåller gemensamma och privata terrasser med odlingsmöjligheter och grönska.

Kjellander Sjöberg har vunnit arkitekttävlingen om Nacka Port, ett nytt kvarter i övergången mellan Nacka och Stockholm. Platsen har sedan tidigare pekats ut av Nacka kommun som lämplig för ett tydligt landmärke.

Kvarteret Klinten ligger mellan Sickla köpkvarter och Hammarby Sjöstad. Ett område med  både av skärgårdskaraktär och äldre industribebyggelse. Tävlingsprogrammet efterfrågade en lösning på hur lokala upplevelsevärden kan skapas, i kombination med en meningsfull och tydlig byggnad som stärker identitet, noder och stråk – och bättre kopplar samman stadsmiljön.

Med utgångspunkt i den antikvariskt intressanta industrimiljön kring Klintens färgfabrik genererar det vinnande förslaget nya typer av stadsrum, och bidrar till ett lokalt, inbjudande stadsliv.

Projektet skapar en sekvens av torg diagonalt genom kvarteret, flexibla och öppna, med olika karaktär som inbjuder till boendeinitiativ, marknader och uteserveringar. Även mot omgivande stadsrum gestaltas upplevelserika platser och vistelseytor, där gående och cyklister kan stanna till.

Kvarteret är uppbyggt av en lägre del ut mot omgivande trafikleder och en samlad volym i sydväst, som uppåt delar sig i två torn med olika höjd. Två trappande sidor vänder sig mot söder och den planerade stadsdelsparken. De trappande sidorna innehåller gemensamma och privata terrasser med odlingsmöjligheter och grönska. Kvarteret är utformat för att ge olika intryck från olika riktningar, en tredimensionell upplevelse som inte blir statisk från någon punkt.

– Nacka Port är en fantastisk chans att genomföra ett projekt som är både intressant och tredimensionellt skulpturalt, med ett humanistiskt och angeläget innehåll. Kvarteret har alla möjligheter att bli hållbart och en myllrande stadsmiljö som höjer intensiteten i området, Stefan Sjöberg, ansvarig arkitekt, i ett pressmeddelande.

Tävlingen med tre inbjudna arkitektkontor genomfördes i samråd med Nacka kommun och Sveriges arkitekter. Arbetet med planläggningen av kvarteret har inletts, med planerad lagakraftvunnen detaljplan under 2020. Uppdragsgivare är Nacka Port AB.

Une guerre amicale sur la twitosphère s'est installée entre le Canadien de Montréal et l'attaquant Brad Marchand des Bruins de Boston.

Les Bruins ont été éliminés en cinq parties par le Lightning de Tampa Bay. À la suite de cette élimination, le Canadien a utilisé le réseau social Twitter pour rappeler à Marchand, sans toutefois le nommer, qu'il était interdit de lécher sur les terrains de golf également.

La réplique de l'enfant terrible des Bruins a été aussi cinglante qu'un double échec dans un coin de patinoire quand il a écrit que ce commentaire était pour le moins amusant de la part d'une équipe éliminée de la course aux séries depuis le mois d'octobre.

Au cours des séries éliminatoires, Marchand avait pris l'étrange habitude de lécher ses adversaires, ce qui avait incité Colin Campbell, le vice-président senior des opérations hockey du circuit, a rencontré l'attaquant des Bruins et le directeur général Don Sweeney, samedi, pour avertir Marchand que ses gestes étaient inacceptables et qu'il s'exposait à  une suspension ou une amende.

The artwork was inspired by Modi’s rally in Mangaluru, ahead of the upcoming state elections in Karnataka, where the Bharatiya Janata Party is working hard to unseat the Congress government.

The cartoonist, Kshitij Bajpai, regularly updates his Twitter profile with examples of his work and has weighed in on several topical matters, such as the Kathua and Unnao rapes and the cash-crunch in several Indian states. Pro-Modi and anti-Congress cartoons are another common thread.

But worryingly, many of his works have sexist and communal undertones. An example of this is an imaginary conversation between a Hindu and a Muslim.

The man depicted as a Muslim in this cartoon appears to be a character in several of Bajpai’s other works.

The outrage after the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua, Jammu, and attempts to obfuscate the details  of the crime have also featured in Bajpai’s work (illustrations not included here as they use the young girl’s name). The cartoonist seemingly aligns with Right-leaning factions who have tried to dismiss the protests against the Kathua rape as a case of selective outrage, aimed at  bringing down the image of Hindus. Some of these cartoons also attack actresses who had expressed anguish at the rape, with one of them referring to an actress as a “Bollywood prostitute”, and another one, not included here, individually naming many of them including #SonamKapoor,#SwaraBhaskar, #HumaKureshi, #KareenaKapoorKhan, #RichaChaddha.

In the past, several publications  have criticised Modi for following people on Twitter who have turned out to be trolls. His party has defended this  saying that the prime minister believes in freedom of speech, does not unfollow anyone, and that his decision to follow someone on social media is not to be viewed as a character certificate of that person.

Ta-Nehisi Coates on Kanye West's search for 'freedom in the age of Trump'

There is much buzz over Ta-Nehisi Coates' latest piece for The Atlantic, which focuses on Kanye West, his own experience with celebrity and the influence the rich and famous have on society.

Here's Ta-Nehisi Coates on Kanye West championing a kind of freedom—""a white freedom, freedom without consequence, freedom without criticism, freedom to be proud and ignorant""—in the age of Donald Trump.https://theatln.tc/2rlItGe

""Kanye West calls his struggle the right to be a “free thinker,” and he is, indeed, championing a kind of freedom—a white freedom.""

Ta-Nehisi Coates was not playing with y'all today.https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…

My Gawd, this piece from Ta-Nehisi Coates on Kanye is just...wow. Amazing.  http://theatlantic.com/entertainment/…pic.twitter.com/4CKYo4Idgn

The Atlantic covers news and analysis on politics, business, culture, technology, national, international and life on the official site of The Atlantic Magazine.

For black artists who rise to the heights of Michael Jackson & Kanye West, the weight of celebrity is more because they come from communities in desperate need of champions: ""When brilliant black artists fall down on the stage, they don’t fall down alone."" https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/?utm_source=atltw…

Ta-Nehisi Coates: “West’s thoughts are not original...These are not stray thoughts. They are the propaganda that justifies voter suppression, and feeds police brutality, and minimizes the murder of Heather Heyer. And Kanye West is now a mouthpiece for it.”https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…

Obviously read the whole amazing piece from Ta-Nehisi Coates, but also, T. I. nails it: This idea, of people removed from the workings of the world, passing down ""advice"" is so telling of folks with so much privilege, they forget what life is really like. https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…pic.twitter.com/tf1hl58K3A

We don't deserve Ta-Nehisi Coates

""Stevie Wonder fought apartheid. James Brown endorsed a racist Nixon. There is a Ray Lewis for every Colin Kaepernick, an O.J. Simpson for every Jim Brown, or, more poignantly, just another Jim Brown.""

This is good, of course, because Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote it, but also because it covers so much ground; race and celebrity as personal and political.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/559763/…

Ta-Nehisi Coates gives the important background, the critical cultural context, then sums it up the event with precision. It is the perfect marriage of perspective and reporting that is so hard to do-here is an example: https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…pic.twitter.com/PMuv5M5sck

This is about Kanye, I guess, but that hardly scratches its surface—it’s Ta-Nehisi on fame, family, community; on what we owe others, and what we owe ourselves:https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…

This is a Ta-Nehisi Coates story about Kanye West, which is also a story about the writer’s own experience with celebrity, and it’s excellent. “I want to tell you a story about the time, still ongoing as of this writing, when I almost lost my mind.”  https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…pic.twitter.com/Il39ObiNCO

""It would be nice if those who sought to use their talents as entrée into another realm would do so with the same care which they took in their craft. But the Gods are fickle and the history of this expectation is mixed.""https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/?utm_source=twb…

""Here is a country which specializes in defining its own deviancy down so that the criminal, the immoral, & the absurd become the baseline, so that even now..the guardians of truth rally to the liar’s flag."" The brilliant Ta-Nehisi Coates in TheAtlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…

It’s been a long time since I’ve read such a singular devastation of truth. This piece is filled with empathy and understanding and pain. Please read this piece by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Read every last drop.https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…

This is a moving essay from Ta-Nehisi Coates. He opened my eyes to why so many people are feeling abandoned -  oranicuhh did the same with her freestyle.

what a powerful sentence:  ""...and more, a paucity of loved ones powerful enough to perform the most essential function of love itself, protecting the beloved from destruction."" - Ta-Nehisi Coateshttps://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/…

“It is often easier to choose the path of self-destruction when you don’t consider who you are taking along for the ride, to die drunk in the street if you experience the deprivation as your own, and not the deprivation of family, friends, and community.”https://twitter.com/theatlantic/status/993446519046115328…

On a créé, il y a six ans, un environnement où l'école est mixte, mais où les classes ne le sont pas. Garçons et filles sont séparés en classe (sauf en secondaires 4 et 5, où les cours optionnels sont mixtes).

« Dans une classe, les gars sont plus animés, disons-le comme ça, explique le directeur Marc Tremblay. Ça s'achale, ça parle quand ce n'est pas le temps, ça niaise, tout ça davantage que chez les filles. Dans une classe, on ne peut pas demander aux garçons de rester assis pendant 60 minutes, oubliez ça. Selon la situation, les profs donnent du lousse ou appliquent plus de poigne. Dans les classes de filles, il y a moins de gestion d'énergie à faire. »

Les enseignants et enseignantes de Reine-Marie ont donc une approche différente selon qu'ils enseignent aux gars ou aux filles. Dans les classes de gars, les interruptions sont plus tolérées, les déplacements aussi, et les cours sont axés sur l'action. « Les filles sont plus organisées, plus disciplinées et dès le primaire, dit Marc Tremblay, l'école valorise ces qualités. Les gars sont plus éparpillés et... l'école n'aime pas ça. »

57,2,,"Los logros de las fuerzas de seguridad de España son incontables. Como suele ser costumbre, se informa mucho menos de lo que en realidad ocurre, generalmente con el objetivo de proteger las operaciones que llevan a cabo y que los terroristas no conozcan el modus operandi que acaba con sus planes.

En el último quinquenio (2013-2017), se han detenido en nuestro país 233 yihadistas y fallecieron ocho, los de la célula de Barcelona y Cambrils. En su mayoría son hombres (89,6%) y la franja de edad de los 18 a los 38 años supone el 68,1%. Un informe del Real Instituto El Cano cuyas fuentes son los sumarios, documentos judiciales, vistas orales de la Audiencia Nacional, informes policiales y notas del Ministerio de Interior, detalla la situación en la que nos encontramos en lo que a terrorismo yihadista respecto. Los datos son preocupantes: el enemigo está dentro y su número aumenta con las segundas generaciones de inmigrantes marroquíes.

Del total de detenidos y muertos en los últimos cinco años, el 46% son de nacionalidad marroquí, mientras que el 37,9% son españoles. El 16,1% son de hasta 19 nacionalidades diferentes. De estas últimas, ocho son de países europeos, dos de países magrebíes, cinco de Hispanoamérica, dos de Oriente Medio y otras dos asiáticas.

Nos encontramos en una situación de casi igualdad estadística entre terroristas procedentes de Marruecos y los que tienen nacionalidad español (por haber pasado los diez años requeridos para la obtención de la nacionalidad o por haber nacido en suelo español). El 53% nació en Marruecos y el 29,5% en España. El segundo país europeo de donde más proceden es de Francia.

El caso de Marruecos es peculiar. Como señala el informe “la nacionalidad marroquí es formalmente irrenunciable, no existiendo tratado de doble nacionalidad con Marruecos y España”.

Desde mediados de los años 90 ya se empezaron a asentar en Cataluña algunas células terroristas

Hay casos concretos en los que el inmigrante rechaza la obtención de nacionalidad española como Ayoub Motchou, nacido en 1994 en Kenitra cuya familia se trasladó siendo él muy joven a Cataluña. Detenido a los 21 años tras una radicalización ‘exprés’, fue condenado en 2017 por adoctrinamiento terrorista. Nunca quiso obtener la nueva nacionalidad, al contrario que el resto de su familia.

La inmigración marroquí es una de las más numerosas en España. En 2015, “el 67,9% de los extranjeros residentes en España de países mayoritariamente musulmanes eran de nacionalidad marroquí”; un 67,7% había nacido en Marruecos.

Como señala El Cano, ciertos aspectos de la cultura del país vecino, habrían “hecho posible que sectores de la población como en concreto los jóvenes, se muestren especialmente receptivos a interpretaciones islamistas y combatientes de la noción de yihad o de la práctica del martirio”.

A finales de 2013, casi un 40% de los cerca de 800 yihadistas marroquíes que habían ido a combatir a Siria procedían de localidades como Ceuta y Melilla. Cataluña es también un foco de radicalización importante, siendo la Comunidad Autónoma que más inmigración musulmana tiene de todo el territorio. Según el último censo realizado por la Unión de Comunidades Islámicas de España, en esta región hay cerca de 516.000 musulmanes, más que votantes de la CUP, más que votantes de Podemos, más que votantes del PP, tantos como votantes tuvo el PSC en las últimas elecciones autonómicas.

Desde mediados de los años 90 ya se empezaron a asentar en Cataluña algunas células terroristas de grupos como Al Qaeda, el Grupo Islámico Armado argelino (GIA), el Grupo Islámico Combatiente Marroquí (GICM) y del Therik e Taliban Pakistan (TTO).

Pese a que en España la mayoría de la población marroquí es de primera generación (la que llega por primera vez a un país de adopción), sus hijos (segunda generación) están creciendo de una manera exponencial y son los que, en gran parte, más fácilmente manipulan las redes terroristas mediante la propaganda.

“Los que viven en España están a menudo sumisos en un complicado y delicado equilibrio entre que culturas que les hace propensos a tensiones de identidad”, señala el informe. “Su apego hacia el país donde han nacido o crecido es limitado, pero tampoco se identifican con el país de sus progenitores […] se encuentran fácil y recurrentemente expuestos a la propaganda yihadista a través de Internet y de las redes sociales”.

Es en estos ámbitos donde los encargados del reclutamiento de nuevos adeptos tienden sus redes y ofrecen una solución para sus problemas: “afirmar violentamente su identidad musulmana”.

Un ejemplo del esfuerzo que deben hacer los musulmanes cuando llegan a países occidentales es el de la prima de una joven detenida junto a otros dos hombres implicados en una trama de reclutamiento yihadista. “Considero que mi prima ha sido una víctima, quizá porque no tiene personalidad o porque sufre una carencia de identidad que todos hemos pasado y superado”, apuntó.

58,1,0.0,"(Reuters) - Rudy Giuliani, who last month joined President Donald Trump’s legal team in the Russia probe, lacks a security clearance and may find it hard to get one to see classified documents because of his work with foreign clients, legal experts said.

Former New York mayor Giuliani told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that he would apply for top secret clearance, along with another Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow. Trump’s outgoing White House lawyer Ty Cobb has a security clearance but no one on his outside legal team has had once since lawyer John Dowd resigned in March.

“They said they would get it right away,” Giuliani said.

Giuliani’s work as a lawyer and security and business consultant during the past 16 years has included assignments on behalf of the government of Mexico City and the Qatari state oil company.

Many of his clients have not been publicly disclosed.

The contacts could raise red flags during his background check about his susceptibility to foreign influence, according to some legal experts. The security clearances are typically issued by the U. S. Department of Justice after FBI review.

The contacts could “cause a significant delay, if not outright denial,” of clearance, said Virginia lawyer John V. Berry, who specializes in the area.

Berry said a slow clearance may be an issue if Giuliani negotiates with U. S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into conclusions of intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.

“It’s hard to represent someone without knowing what’s in the files,” Berry said.

Washington national security lawyer Bradley Moss said he thought Trump’s team might ultimately decide it was too much trouble to get Giuliani a security clearance and “just keep him in the big picture.” Moss pointed out Giuliani has acted as the public face of the Trump team since coming aboard.

Both Berry and Moss said Trump has the power to grant a clearance, despite any concerns.

Given the involvement of intelligence agencies and issues of contact with Russia, some of the materials relevant to the investigation would be classified as top secret or higher. The Kremlin denies interference in the election and Trump denies any collusion with Moscow officials.

Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday on whether he would have difficulty securing a clearance. On Thursday, he played down the importance of a clearance for his role.

“There are only a few excerpted portions that we have to see,” he said. “I know what’s in them from the newspapers but, to make sure, they’re getting me a security clearance.”

Sekulow said he started the process after Dowd left the legal team. He said other lawyers on the team would seek clearance as well.

Giuliani took a leave of absence, rather than resigning, from law firm Greenberg Traurig to join Trump’s legal team.

Virginia Canter, an ethics lawyer with watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that is a potential problem because he is still tied to a firm that represents foreign governments.

Berry said investigators conducting background checks for security clearances look at how close a person’s ties are, what kind of money they receive from the contacts, and whether the country has interests adverse to the United States.

To get a clearance, candidates must fill out Standard Form 86, a 127-page document that Berry said “goes into every part of your life” and requires listing foreign contacts.

Moss said interim security clearances could be issued but only after the form is reviewed and there are no immediate red flags.

Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received a temporary clearance but lost access to highly classified information in February 2018. Kushner had not received his full security clearance because of his extensive business and financial connections.

According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the decision to extend the mandate of the OSCE Observer Mission to Gukovo and Donetsk was taken on May 3 at a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council, and it showed “the complete isolation of Russia in its reluctance to ensure effective international control at the border.”

Ukraine urged the Russian Federation to fulfill its obligations under the Minsk agreements.

By this time next week, we predict every famous comedian will have weighed in on Wolf’s performance. On Thursday, it was Tina Fey’s turn.

Fey, “the dean of female comedians” according to “Today” show co-host Savannah Guthrie, appeared on the morning program to chat about her Broadway hit “Mean Girls” and, of course, Wolf.

When asked about the hullabaloo over last weekend’s dinner guest, the “Bossypants” author was unsurprisingly frank.

Fey said that each year whenever she hears the words White House correspondents’ dinner, her first reaction is relief.

“I’m so happy I’m not hosting,” she added. “It’s the roughest room.” The trick she said was to walk up to the lectern and not care what the audience thinks of the next 20 minutes. Fey mentioned Stephen Colbert’s 2006 eye-popping routine as a model.

[Michelle Wolf wasn’t the first to shock a media dinner. Stephen Colbert and Wanda Sykes, anyone?]

On Wolf, who joked that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders “burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye,” Fey was decisive.

“I think Michelle went and did her job. You can’t ask a coyote to guard the house,” Fey said. “When you invite a comedian into that place where that tone is set, they’re going to give it to you straight, and I think that’s pretty much what she did.”

So that’s a thumbs-up from Fey, who had one last suggestion for the White House Correspondents’ Association, which in a statement said Wolf’s routine was “not in the spirit” of the dinner’s mission.

“But maybe next year a children’s choir,” Fey said.

Michelle Wolf’s correspondents’ dinner set made Washington uncomfortable. But comedians have her back.

66,4,0.0,"The Earth is locked on an “irreversible” course of climatic disruption from the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and the impacts will only worsen unless nations agree to dramatic cuts in pollution, an international panel of climate scientists warned Sunday.

(From The Washington Post / by  The planet faces a future of extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting polar ice from soaring levels of carbon dioxide and other gases, the U. N. panel said. Only an unprecedented global effort to slash emissions within a relatively short time period will prevent temperatures from crossing a threshold that scientists say could trigger far more dangerous disruptions, the panel warned.

“Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts,” concluded the report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which draws on contributions from thousands of scientists from around the world.

The report said some impacts of climate change will “continue for centuries,” even if all emissions from fossil-fuel burning were to stop. The question facing governments is whether they can act to slow warming to a pace at which humans and natural ecosystems can adapt, or risk “abrupt and irreversible changes” as the atmosphere and oceans absorb ever-greater amounts of thermal energy within a blanket of heat-trapping gases, according to scientists who contributed to the report.

The report is the distillation of a five-year effort to assess the latest evidence on climate change and its consequences, from direct atmospheric measurements of carbon dioxide to thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies. The final document to emerge from the latest of five assessments since 1990, it is intended to provide a scientific grounding for world leaders who will attempt to negotiate an international climate treaty in Paris late next year.

While the IPCC is barred from endorsing policy, the report lays out possible scenarios and warns that the choices will grow increasingly dire if carbon emissions continue on their current record-breaking trajectory.

“It’s not too late, but the longer you wait, the more expensive it gets,” Gary Yohe, a Wesleyan University professor who also participated in the drafting of the report, said in an interview. Damage to the Earth’s ecosystems is “irreversible to the extent to which we have committed ourselves, but we will commit ourselves to higher and higher and higher damages and impacts” if the world’s leaders fail to act, Yohe said.

A succession of IPCC reports since the 1990s have drawn an ever-clearer connection between human activity and climate change. But Sunday’s “synthesis report” makes the case more emphatically than before, asserting that the warming trend seen on land and in the oceans since the 1950s is “unequivocal” and that it is “extremely likely” — a term that the IPCC uses to denote a 95 percent or greater probability — that humans are the main cause.

“Human influence on the climate system is clear,” the panel states in a 40-page summary intended for policymakers.

In late 2013, when the first report of this round of the IPCC’s work came out, skeptics trained their attention on the contention that in recent years the rate of global warming has seemingly “paused” or slowed down. But the latest document is fairly dismissive of that idea, acknowledging that, while the rate of warming in the past 15 years has indeed been somewhat smaller than the rate since 1951, “trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends.”

Although it is too early to say, claims about a possible slowing of global warming may be swept aside by new data: According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, all-time monthly temperature records were broken four times in 2014 — in May, June, August and September — raising the possibility that 2014 may set a record as the hottest year ever.

In cautious and often technically complex language, the new report cites soaring emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases in the past 60 years as the cause of nearly all the warming seen so far. While carbon dioxide is a naturally abundant gas essential for plant photosynthesis, it has been accumulating in the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate as a byproduct of the burning of fossil fuels by automobiles, power plants and factories. Concentrations of the heat-trapping gas is 40 percent higher than in pre-industrial times, a level “unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years,” the report states.

Most of the excess heat is absorbed by the ocean, muting the effects. Yet, climate change is having profound impacts on “natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans,” the panel concluded. It cited rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, warmer air and ocean temperatures, melting glaciers and vanishing sea ice.

And because of the long amount of time that carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere, some impacts are locked in, perhaps for centuries to come, the report warned.

“A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change . . . is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale,” the report said. Sea level rise, for example, “will continue for many centuries beyond 2100” because of ice-sheet melting that is underway and other causes.

Scientists and policymakers have set a goal of restraining the average global temperature increase to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, on grounds that a higher increase would change the climate so dramatically that neither humans nor natural ecosystems could easily adapt. That would probably require keeping concentrations of key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to under 450 parts per million by 2100, the panel said. Concentrations passed 400 parts per million for the first time in 2013.

Even with a rapid shift to renewable energy, the task of achieving such drastic reductions is daunting, IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri said in a speech last week as panel members began final revisions to the report.

“May I humbly suggest that policymakers avoid being overcome by the seeming hopelessness of addressing climate change,” Pachauri said. “It is not hopeless. This is not to say it will be easy.”

The report will likely add fuel to the debate over environmental policies in key congressional races. Candidates in several Senate and House races have clashed over how to respond to climate change and whether it indeed exists.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry, reacting to the report, said it was time to move beyond the politicization of climate science.

“We can’t prevent a large scale disaster if we don’t heed this kind of hard science,” Kerry said in a statement. “The longer we are stuck in a debate over ideology and politics, the more the costs of inaction grow and grow. Those who choose to ignore or dispute the science so clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for our kids and grandkids.”

Global temperatureAnalysis: Why scientists think 100% of global warming is due to humans

The extent of the human contribution to modern global warming is a hotly debated topic in political circles, particularly in the US.

During a recent congressional hearing, Rick Perry, the US energy secretary, remarked that “to stand up and say that 100% of global warming is because of human activity, I think on its face, is just indefensible”.

However, the science on the human contribution to modern warming is quite clear. Humans emissions and activities have caused around 100% of the warming observed since 1950, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) fifth assessment report.

Here Carbon Brief examines how each of the major factors affecting the Earth’s climate would influence temperatures in isolation – and how their combined effects almost perfectly predict long-term changes in the global temperature.

* Since 1850, almost all the long-term warming can be explained by greenhouse gas emissions and other human activities.

* If greenhouse gas emissions alone were warming the planet, we would expect to see about a third more warming than has actually occurred. They are offset by cooling from human-produced atmospheric aerosols.

* Aerosols are projected to decline significantly by 2100, bringing total warming from all factors closer to warming from greenhouse gases alone.

* Natural variability in the Earth’s climate is unlikely to play a major role in long-term warming.

In its 2013 fifth assessment report, the IPCC stated in its summary for policymakers that it is “extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature” from 1951 to 2010 was caused by human activity. By “extremely likely”, it meant that there was between a 95% and 100% probability that more than half of modern warming was due to humans.

This somewhat convoluted statement has been often misinterpreted as implying that the human responsibility for modern warming lies somewhere between 50% and 100%. In fact, as NASA’s Dr Gavin Schmidt has pointed out, the IPCC’s implied best guess was that humans were responsible for around 110% of observed warming (ranging from 72% to 146%), with natural factors in isolation leading to a slight cooling over the past 50 years.

Similarly, the recent US fourth national climate assessment found that between 93% to 123% of observed 1951-2010 warming was due to human activities.

These conclusions have led to some confusion as to how more than 100% of observed warming could be attributable to human activity. A human contribution of greater than 100% is possible because natural climate change associated with volcanoes and solar activity would most likely have resulted in a slight cooling over the past 50 years, offsetting some of the warming associated with human activities.

Scientists measure the various factors that affect the amount of energy that reaches and remains in the Earth’s climate. They are known as “radiative forcings”.

These forcings include greenhouse gases, which trap outgoing heat, aerosols – both from human activities and volcanic eruptions – that reflect incoming sunlight and influence cloud formation, changes in solar output, changes in the reflectivity of the Earth’s surface associated with land use, and many other factors.

To assess the role of each different forcing in observed temperature changes, Carbon Brief adapted a simple statistical climate model developed by Dr Karsten Haustein and his colleagues at the University of Oxford and University of Leeds. This model finds the relationship between both human and natural climate forcings and temperature that best matches observed temperatures, both globally and over land areas only.

The figure below shows the estimated role of each different climate forcing in changing global surface temperatures since records began in 1850 – including greenhouse gases (red line), aerosols (dark blue), land use (light blue), ozone (pink), solar (yellow) and volcanoes (orange).

The black dots show observed temperatures from the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, while the grey line shows the estimated warming from the combination of all the different types of forcings

See methods at the end of the article for details. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.

The combination of all radiative forcings generally matches longer-term changes in observed temperatures quite well. There is some year-to-year variability, primarily from El Niño events, that is not driven by changes in forcings. There are also periods from 1900-1920 and 1930-1950 where some larger disagreements are evident between projected and observed warming, both in this simple model and in more complex climate models.

The chart highlights that, of all the radiative forcings analysed, only increases in greenhouse gas emissions produce the magnitude of warming experienced over the past 150 years.

If greenhouse gas emissions alone were warming the planet, we would expect to see about a third more warming than has actually occurred.

So, what roles do all the other factors play?

The extra warming from greenhouse gases is being offset by sulphur dioxide and other products of fossil fuel combustion that form atmospheric aerosols. Aerosols in the atmosphere both reflect incoming solar radiation back into space and increase the formation of high, reflective clouds, cooling the Earth.

Ozone is a short-lived greenhouse gas that traps outgoing heat and warms the Earth. Ozone is not emitted directly, but is formed when methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds break down in the atmosphere. Increases in ozone are directly attributable to human emissions of these gases.

In the upper atmosphere, reductions in ozone associated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halocarbons depleting the ozone layer have had a modest cooling effect. The net effects of combined lower and upper atmospheric ozone changes have modestly warmed the Earth by a few tenths of a degree.

Changes in the way land is used alter the reflectivity of the Earth’s surface. For example, replacing a forest with a field will generally increase the amount of sunlight reflected back into space, particularly in snowy regions. The net climate effect of land-use changes since 1850 is a modest cooling.

Volcanoes have a short-term cooling effect on the climate due to their injection of sulphate aerosols high into the stratosphere, where they can remain aloft for a few years, reflecting incoming sunlight back into space. However, once the sulphates drift back down to the surface, the cooling effect of volcanoes goes away. The orange line shows the estimated impact of volcanoes on the climate, with large downward spikes in temperatures of up to 0.4C associated with major eruptions.

Finally, solar activity is measured by satellites over the past few decades and estimated based on sunspot counts in the more distant past. The amount of energy reaching the Earth from the sun fluctuates modestly on a cycle of around 11 years. There has been a slight increase in overall solar activity since the 1850s, but the amount of additional solar energy reaching the Earth is small compared to other radiative forcings examined.

Over the past 50 years, solar energy reaching the Earth has actually declined slightly, while temperatures have increased dramatically.

The accuracy of this model depends on the accuracy of the radiative forcing estimates. Some types of radiative forcing like that from atmospheric CO2 concentrations can be directly measured and have relatively small uncertainties. Others, such as aerosols, are subject to much greater uncertainties due to the difficulty of accurately measuring their effects on cloud formation.

These are accounted for in the figure below, which shows combined natural forcings (blue line) and human forcings (red line) and the uncertainties that the statistical model associates with each. These shaded areas are based on 200 different estimates of radiative forcings, incorporating research attempting to estimate a range of values for each. Uncertainties in human factors increase after 1960, driven largely by increases in aerosol emissions after that point.

The combination of all natural and human forcings (grey line) is also shown. See methods at the end of the article for details. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.

Overall, warming associated with all human forcings agrees quite well with observed warming, showing that about 104% of the total since the start of the “modern” period in 1950 comes from human activities (and 103% since 1850), which is similar to the value reported by the IPCC. Combined natural forcings show a modest cooling, primarily driven by volcanic eruptions.

The simple statistical model used for this analysis by Carbon Brief differs from much more complex climate models generally used by scientists to assess the human fingerprint on warming. Climate models do not simply “fit” forcings to observed temperatures. Climate models also include variations in temperature over space and time, and can account for different efficacies of radiative forcings in different regions of the Earth.

However, when analysing the impact of different forcings on global temperatures, complex climate models generally find results similar to simple statistical models. The figure below, from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, shows the influence of different factors on temperature for the period from 1950 to 2010. Observed temperatures are shown in black, while the sum of human forcings is shown in orange.

This suggests that human forcings alone would have resulted in approximately 110% of observed warming. The IPCC also included the estimated magnitude of internal variability over that period in the models, which they suggest is relatively small and comparable to that of natural forcings.

As Prof Gabi Hegerl at the University of Edinburgh tells Carbon Brief: “The IPCC report has an estimate that basically says the best guess is no contribution [from natural variability] with not that much uncertainty.”

Land temperatures have warmed considerably faster than average global temperatures over the past century, with temperatures reaching around 1.7C above pre-industrial levels in recent years. The land temperature record also goes back further in time than the global temperature record, though the period prior to 1850 is subject to much greater uncertainties.

Both human and natural radiative forcings can be matched to land temperatures using the statistical model. The magnitude of human and natural forcings will differ a bit between land and global temperatures. For example, volcanic eruptions appear to have a larger influence on land, as land temperatures are likely to respond faster to rapid changes in forcings.

The figure below shows the relative contribution of each different radiative forcing to land temperatures since 1750.

Land mean surface temperatures from Berkeley Earth (black dots) and modeled influence of different radiative forcings (colored lines), as well as the combination of all forcings (grey line) for the period from 1750 to 2017. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.

The combination of all forcings generally matches observed temperatures quite well, with short-term variability around the grey line primarily driven by El Niño and La Niña events. There is a wider variation in temperatures prior to 1850, reflecting the much larger uncertainties in the observational records that far back.

There is still a period around 1930 and 1940 where observations exceed what the model predicts, though the differences are less pronounced than in global temperatures and the 1900-1920 divergence is mostly absent in land records.

Volcanic eruptions in the late 1700s and early 1800s stand out sharply in the land record. The eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia in 1815 may have cooled land temperatures by a massive 1.5C, though records at the time were limited to parts of the Northern Hemisphere and it is, therefore, hard to draw a firm conclusion about global impacts. In general, volcanoes appear to cool land temperatures by nearly twice as much as global temperatures.

Carbon Brief used the same model to project future temperature changes associated with each forcing factor. The figure below shows observations up to 2017, along with future post-2017 radiative forcings from RCP6.0, a medium-to-high future warming scenario.

Global mean surface temperatures from Berkeley Earth (black dots) and modeled influence of different radiative forcings (colored lines) for the period from 1850 to 2100. Forcings post-2017 taken from RCP6.0. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.

When provided with the radiative forcings for the RCP6.0 scenario, the simple statistical model shows warming of around 3C by 2100, nearly identical to the average warming that climate models find.

Future radiative forcing from CO2 is expected to continue to increase if emissions rise. Aerosols, on the other hand, are projected to peak at today’s levels and decline significantly by 2100, driven in large part by concerns about air quality. This reduction in aerosols will enhance overall warming, bringing total warming from all radiative forcing closer to warming from greenhouse gases alone. The RCP scenarios assume no specific future volcanic eruptions, as the timing of these is unknowable, while solar output continues its 11-year cycle.

This approach can also be applied to land temperatures, as shown in the figure below. Here, land temperatures are shown between 1750 and 2100, with post-2017 forcings also from RCP6.0.

Land mean surface temperatures from Berkeley Earth (black dots) and modeled influence of different radiative forcings (colored lines) for the period from 1750 to 2100. Forcings post-2017 taken from RCP6.0. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.

The land is expected to warm about 30% faster than the globe as a whole, as the rate of warming over the oceans is buffered by ocean heat uptake. This is seen in the model results, where land warms by around 4C by 2100 compared to 3C globally in the RCP6.0 scenario.

There is a wide range of future warming possible from different RCP scenarios and different values for the sensitivity of the climate system, but all show a similar pattern of declining future aerosol emissions and a larger role for greenhouse gas forcing in future temperatures.

While natural forcings from solar and volcanoes do not seem to play much of a role in long-term warming, there is also natural variability associated with ocean cycles and variations in ocean heat uptake.

As the vast majority of energy trapped by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the oceans rather than the atmosphere, changes in the rate of ocean heat uptake can potentially have large impacts on the surface temperature. Some researchers have argued that multidecadal cycles, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), can play a role in warming at a decadal scale.

While human factors explain all the long-term warming, there are some specific periods that appear to have warmed or cooled faster than can be explained based on our best estimates of radiative forcing. For example, the modest mismatch between the radiative forcing-based estimate and observations during the mid-1900s might be evidence of a role for natural variability during that period.

A number of researchers have examined the potential for natural variability to impact long-term warming trends. They have found that it generally plays a limited role. For example, Dr Markus Huber and Dr Reto Knutti at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (IAC) in Zurich found a maximum possible contribution of natural variability of around 26% (+/- 12%) over the past 100 years and 18% (+/- 9%) over the past 50 years.

“We can never completely rule out that natural variability is larger than we currently think. But that is a weak argument: you can, of course, never rule out the unknown unknown. The question is whether there is strong, or even any evidence for it. And the answer is no, in my view.

Models get the short-term temperature variability approximately right. In many cases, they even have too much. And for the long term, we can’t be sure because the observations are limited. But the forced response pretty much explains the observations, so there is no evidence from the 20th century that we are missing something…

Even if models were found to underestimate internal variability by a factor of three, it is extremely unlikely [less than 5% chance] that internal variability could produce a trend as large as observed.”

Similarly, Dr Martin Stolpe and colleagues, also at IAC, recently analysed the role of multidecadal natural variability in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They found that “less than 10% of the observed global warming during the second half of the 20th century is caused by internal variability in these two ocean basins, reinforcing the attribution of most of the observed warming to anthropogenic forcings”.

Internal variability is likely to have a much larger role in regional temperatures. For example, in producing unusually warm periods in the Arctic and the US in the 1930s. However, its role in influencing long-term changes in global surface temperatures appears to be limited.

While there are natural factors that affect the Earth’s climate, the combined influence of volcanoes and changes in solar activity would have resulted in cooling rather than warming over the past 50 years.

The global warming witnessed over the past 150 years matches nearly perfectly what is expected from greenhouse gas emissions and other human activity, both in the simple model examined here and in more complex climate models. The best estimate of the human contribution to modern warming is around 100%.

Some uncertainty remains due to the role of natural variability, but researchers suggest that ocean fluctuations and similar factors are unlikely to be the cause of more than a small fraction of modern global warming.

The simple statistical model used in this article is adapted from the Global Warming Index published by Haustein et al (2017). In turn, it is based on the Otto et al (2015) model.

The model estimates contributions to observed climate change and removes the impact of natural year-to-year fluctuations by a multiple linear regression of observed temperatures and estimated responses to total human-induced and total natural drivers of climate change. The forcing responses are provided by the standard simple climate model given in Chapter 8 of IPCC (2013), but the size of these responses is estimated by the fit to the observations. The forcings are based on IPCC (2013) values and were updated to 2017 using data from NOAA and ECLIPSE. 200 variations of these forcings were provided by Dr. Piers Forster  of the University of Leeds, reflecting the uncertainty in forcing estimates. An Excel spreadsheet containing their model is also provided.

The model was adapted by calculating forcing responses for each of the different major climate forcings rather than simply total human and natural forcings, using the Berkeley Earth record for observations. The decay time of thermal response used in converting forcings to forcing responses was adjusted to be one year rather than four years for volcanic forcings to better reflect the fast response time present in observations. The effects of El Niño and La Niña (ENSO) events was removed from the observations using an approach adapted from Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) and the Kaplan El Niño 3.4 index when calculating the volcanic temperature response, as the overlap between volcanoes and ENSO otherwise complicates empirical estimates.

The temperature response for each individual forcing was calculated by scaling their forcing responses by the total human or natural coefficients from the regression model. The regression model was also run separately for land temperatures. Temperature responses for each forcing between 2018 and 2100 were estimated using forcing data from RCP6.0, normalised to match the magnitude of observed forcings at the end of 2017.

Uncertainties in total human and total natural temperature response was estimated using a Monte Carlo analysis of 200 different forcing series, as well as the uncertainties in the estimated regression coefficients. The Python code used to run the model is archived with GitHub and available for download.

Observational data from 2017 shown in the figures is based on the average of the first 10 months of the year and is likely to be quite similar to the ultimate annual value.

",1,2004,Analysis: Why scientists think 100% of global warming is due to humans | Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-scientists-think-100-of-global-warming-is-due-to-humans,,
68,1,0.0,"For a section of the right-wing media, it was too good to miss, an opportunity to cast doubt on one of their favourite bugbears – climate change.

A scientific study had estimated that there would still be a reasonable chance of restricting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century even if humans used the equivalent of current fossil fuel consumption for 20 years.

The lead scientist involved in the research, Dr Richard Millar of Oxford University, in an article on the Carbon Brief website said this “update” on earlier estimates suggested that “we have a little more breathing space than previously thought” to achieve the target to avoid dangerous global warming adopted by the Paris Agreement.

But some found a rather different message in the paper in the journal Nature Geoscience.

“Fear of global warming is exaggerated, say scientists,” screamed an article on Mail Online.

And the Conservative MP David Davies – not to be confused with Brexit Secretary David Davis – tweeted: “World's scientists now being forced to admit they were wrong and sceptics like the Global Warming Policy Foundation were right all along.”

He actually included a link to The Independent's story, although his remark was very much his own spin on the subject and not reflected in the article.

“Climate models are ‘wrong,’” proclaimed the Telegraph on its front page.

And The Times' front page had scientists “admitting” that the “world is warming slower than predicted”.

Curiously the Mail Online also published another article about the same research with a headline much more in keeping with the paper. “We CAN meet ambitious Paris climate change agreement goal to limit global temperatures rise to 1.5C by 2100 (but only if countries stop using coal),” it said.

You may be unsurprised to know they have done nothing of the sort.

In a speech last year to a meeting of the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), Matt Ridley, a hereditary peer and former chairman of the Northern Rock bank, laid out the ‘sceptic’ philosophy.

Mainstream scientists had a “vested interest in alarm” that was making them exaggerate the risks of global warming, he claimed. And there was no need to worry because “environment predictions of doom” were “always” wrong.

According to the GWPF’s founder, former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson, greenhouse gases produced by human activity have caused the Earth’s climate to get warmer.

But he told a House of Lords committee that it would “crazy” for the UK to try to do anything about this process, because our emissions account for just two per cent of the global total.

The take-home message from all this can be summed up by one basic idea: keep on burning the fossil fuels.

Dr Millar told The Independent he had noticed a problem with the media coverage of the research.

“These headlines had a clear spin in what they were trying to put across, but the articles themselves were less bad,” he said.

The paper provides a new estimate of humanity’s ‘carbon budget’ – the total amount of fossil fuels that can be burned before global warming would probably hit 1.5C. So far human influence has caused temperatures to warm by about 0.9C.

The researchers concluded that total emissions of 200 gigatonnes of carbon – or 240 gigatonnes with significant amounts of climate mitigation – would probably produce less than 0.6C of warming, according to their analysis of climate models.

Dr Millar said this budget represented about 20 years of emissions at the current rate, giving humanity more time than some other estimates and, therefore, a greater hope of meeting the Paris Agreement target.

But he said a more sensible way of spending this budget would be to start making cuts now with a view to hitting a zero-carbon world in about 40 years.

And that, in sharp contrast to the sceptics, is the take-home message: start cutting greenhouse gases and a temperature increase that could lead to dangerous climate change can be avoided.

Yes. Climate models incorporate the laws of physics to try to make sense of what is happening, but they will never be 100 per cent accurate.

“All models are wrong,” goes a saying in science, “but that doesn’t mean they are not useful”.

As Dr Millar explained: “By definition, a model is not the real world … it’s called a climate model for a reason.

“But they can do an incredibly good job at capturing some incredibly complex physics.”

Scientists have produced estimates of how warm the world will get if the amount of carbon increases to double pre-industrial levels.

This produces a range of results from about 1.5C to 5C. The lower end of the scale would be relatively benign; the upper end would result in the end of human civilisation as we know it.

Those who say we will be fine make the same mistake as those who say we are heading for Armageddon – insisting on certainty when there is doubt.

The question then is what is the wisest course? Roll the dice and hope for the best or make efforts to ensure the worst-case scenario does not happen?

Shaw was unarmed, when he courageously overcame a man who was armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic gun and who was in the process of killing four young people of color and injuring others. The massacre took place in an Antioch Waffle House on Sunday morning.in Nashville reports:

The mayor of Nashville and the CEO of Waffle House both sung his praises the day he wrestled an AR-15 out of the gunman’s hands, burning his own hands on the gun barrel. He was also grazed by a bullet during the attack.

“If a hero is ‘a person noted for courageous acts or nobility of character,’ then James Shaw Jr. is a hero twice over, for he has demonstrated both his courage and character in a manner few could ever attempt to emulate.""

If you watch the full video of the ceremony, you will see Shaw say that he does not consider himself a hero. In tears and with incredible humility and integrity, Shaw said he wasn’t trying to save the lives of others—he was trying to save his own.

Who admits something like that? Where does that kind of honesty come from?

Shaw now looks to the future and says the the honor means a lot to him. He calls what happened “a life-changing moment,” adding, “I’m going to try to use this moment as a platform to bring awareness to shootings and just violence.”

In order to raise money for the Waffle House shooting victims, Shaw set up a GoFundMe page which has already raised over $170k.

WSMV adds there was another act of kindness today, by a man who’s was moved by Shaw’s heroism.

“I normally don’t get involved directly in these matters, but James’ grace has inspired me to start this page to give him the support I feel he deserves. According to news reports, James has a 4-year-old daughter. Perhaps this money can be used for her college fund or some other education-related expense. But I’d be just as happy if James used some of this money to take his family on a nice vacation.”

70,1,,"US rap artist Kanye West has said the historic enslavement of African Americans that took place over hundreds of years may have been a ""choice"".

""When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,"" he said during an appearance on entertainment site TMZ.

The star recently made headlines over his vocal support for President Trump.

Black people were forcibly brought from Africa to the US during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries and sold as slaves.

West later tweeted that his comments on Tuesday had been misinterpreted and that he ""brought up the 400 years point because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years"".

To the interviewers at TMZ, West said that ""right now we're choosing to be enslaved"", which provoked an angry response from a black member of staff at the company, Van Lathan.

Mr Lathan said the rapper's comments appeared to be made with ""the absence of thought"".

""You're entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact and real-world, real-life consequence behind everything that you just said,"" he added as the star stood still stroking his chin.

""We have to deal with the marginalisation that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice,"" Mr Lathan continued, adding: ""I'm appalled, and brother I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something to me that isn't real.""

In the TMZ footage, West refers to Mr Trump as ""my boy"" and says that the president is ""one of rap's favourite people"".

His comments sparked a backlash on social media with some Twitter users suggesting the rapper should revisit the history books.

It comes just days after West released a song defending his support for Mr Trump, who he has insisted is ""fighting for the people"".

The controversial track, Ye vs The People, caused a stir among rappers, including Snoop Dogg, who appeared offended by its lyrical content.

""Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand,"" West raps, referring to a peace agreement between two notorious Los Angeles street gangs.

Snoop Dogg's cousin, the rapper Daz Dillinger, later posted a video message calling on Crip gang members to ""f**k Kanye up"" if they see him in California.

The video is being investigated by police, according to reports.

West has courted controversy with his support for Mr Trump and conservative commentators like Scott Adams and Candace Owens, who has spoken out against the Black Lives Matter movement.

71,1,0.0,"MEXICO CITY — For weeks, President Trump has expressed alarm about a caravan of Central American migrants heading for the United States and vowed to keep them out. But on Tuesday, U. S. officials allowed small groups of the asylum seekers across the border, bowing to U.S. and international law regarding such cases.

By Tuesday evening, 25 of the 150 migrants had been escorted to San Diego to begin the process of applying for asylum. Their arrival appeared to be a blow to Trump’s efforts to block the caravan — a campaign that has involved calling out the National Guard, threatening Mexico if it did not stop the migrants and warning that the participants, mostly women and children, represented a threat to national security.

In the end, though, it was not clear that the episode would be a setback for a president who turns his frustration into punctuation in his fight against illegal immigration.

Subscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today’s most popular stories on The Washington Post

The president has used the migrants’ journey to repeatedly project a show of force, announcing that he would deploy National Guard troops to the Mexican border and invoking the caravan to call for tougher immigration policies, such as constructing a border wall, that have so far eluded him.

“We are a nation of laws. We have to have borders,” Trump said at a news conference this week with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, noting that he has been watching the caravan “for weeks” as it traveled north. “We don’t have borders, we don’t have a country.”

That show of force belies the reality: In one sense, the Trump administration’s hands are largely tied when it comes to these migrants.

Despite Trump’s demands, relayed to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, to “not let these large Caravans” into the United States, federal law and international treaties mandate that the administration consider the requests of asylum applicants. The asylum process can take years.

The United States each month receives thousands of people seeking asylum, saying they cannot return home because they face danger as a result of their political beliefs, their religion, their race or other issues. Those cases are normally processed with little fanfare, and other convoys of Central American migrants have made similar journeys in recent years without attracting much attention.

But conservative American media and the president seized on video images of the latest caravan — which comprised around 1,500 people when it set out a month ago from the southern Mexican city of Tapachula — as a sign of out-of-control migration.

The caravan is “a symbol. It’s something that he can easily understand and his supporters can understand, for him to score political points,” said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank.

In one of his first tweets on the caravan, Trump said it was evidence that the border was “Getting more dangerous.” He escalated his rhetoric, at one point threatening Mexico and Honduras with reprisals if they did not stop the convoy. “Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen,” he tweeted.

Trump also repeatedly used the caravan to lambaste Congress, which has not been willing to approve some of his immigration proposals.

“Now we’re working on the border with the worst laws any country — no matter where you go, all over the world, they can’t even believe it. And we’re doing the best we can with it,” Trump said at this week’s news conference. “But we have to have changes in Congress, and we have to have it quickly.”

The caravan episode gave Trump another opportunity to satisfy those in his conservative base who have been his most ardent supporters. His retreat to his signature hard-line positions early last month came not only in conjunction with news coverage of the caravan but at a time when his base was showing signs of impatience that Trump had as yet failed to fulfill major campaign promises on immigration. At that time, Trump had reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion spending measure that did not include measures he had sought cracking down on illegal migration — a package that was abhorred by his base and prompted a backlash in conservative media.

Attorneys who represent asylum applicants argued, however, that Trump’s rhetoric would be useless in deterring migrants, since many had no other option but to flee their homelands.

Government officials “think their words and rhetoric can deter people from coming here unlawfully,” said Bryan Johnson, an immigration lawyer based in Bay Shore, N. Y. “But the people who come aren’t going to be deterred. They don’t have a choice.”

That was the argument of Luis Alexander Rodriguez Pineda, 18, who came from El Salvador with his cousin and his uncle. He said he escaped from his country and joined the caravan because of death threats against him from gangs.

“Since we left Tapachula, the president has been saying we’re terrorists who are going to enter the country, but it’s not true,” he said. “Now we’re waiting for his answer. But we know that he has no right to deny us asylum.”

U. S. officials started processing the asylum seekers Monday night, after keeping them waiting for a day because of what authorities called a lack of capacity. While the government was obliged to grant the migrants asylum interviews, the arc of their cases is impossible to predict. The Trump administration has said that many asylum applicants disappear after being freed following their initial court dates, joining the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country. Because most members of the Central American caravan are families, they would typically be released with ankle bracelets to monitor their movement, or on bail bonds.

With the enormous amount of attention on the caravan, however, some lawyers worried that these migrants would be more likely to be deported quickly.

“This particular group was more open about how they were coming to the U. S., and now they're suffering the political consequences,” Johnson said.

Supporters of tighter immigration policies applauded Trump’s actions, even if they did not keep out members of the caravan.

“The administration seems to have responded vigorously enough to avoid sending the message that future efforts like this caravan will succeed,” said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based think tank. “Once you send the signal that some people will be able to get away with this, others will receive that signal and follow . . . and 150 people will become 150,000 and after that a million.”

But some members of Trump’s base remain frustrated as his immigration proposals have stalled.

Conservative commentator Ann Coulter sarcastically tweeted this week “THEY’RE TERRIFIED, KIRSTJEN!” in reference to the homeland security secretary’s remarks to the migrants that they would be referred for prosecution if they cross the border illegally.

Coulter added: “Caravan: ‘We’ll see you soon Mr President!’ ”

Calatrava construye un puente que caerá en lunes                                                            SERÁ BLANCO Y CON PINCHOS

La Generalitat Valenciana ha encargado al arquitecto español Santiago Calatrava el diseño de un puente que caerá en lunes. El encargo coincide con la investidura de Mariano Rajoy, que ha adelantado su intención de trasladar los días festivos a los lunes más cercanos con el fin de aumentar la competitividad de las empresas. Aunque la Generalitat no ha confirmado que el puente de Calatrava esté relacionado con el propósito de Rajoy, sí ha expresado en un comunicado su convicción de que Calatrava es el arquitecto más adecuado para emprender el proyecto “porque no es la primera vez que asume una tarea de estas características”. El comunicado alude al desplome, en agosto de 2006, de parte de la estructura del Palacio de Congresos y Exposiciones de Oviedo. “Diseñar una estructura pensada para caer un día concreto no es fácil, a no ser que se la eche abajo directamente con dinamita. Lo que nosotros queremos no es eso. Pensamos en una caída silenciosa y lenta. Un leve desprendimiento lo más natural posible”, explica un portavoz de la Generalitat.

Por el momento, se ignora dónde será construido el puente en cuestión. “Queremos que sea un sitio en el que Calatrava aún no haya construido nada. Ya lo encontraremos”. Ni el equipo arquitectónico ni el propio Santiago Calatrava han querido adelantar los detalles del proyecto ni mucho menos precisar en qué lunes caerá el puente. “Todos sabemos la ilusión que hace que caiga un puente cuando menos te lo esperas. Si marcamos el día en el calendario con demasiada antelación se pierde la sorpresa. Ya hemos hecho mucho desvelando que será un lunes”, insisten desde la Generalitat. En estos momentos, el laureado arquitecto se encuentra encerrado en su estudio “luchando mentalmente contra el carácter imprevisible de la naturaleza, tratando de forzar caídas de objetos con la mirada”.

En cuanto a las características físicas del puente, se sabe con total seguridad que será blanco y con pinchos, “en la línea de lo que ha venido haciendo Calatrava desde que, en 1954, pinchó con un palillo una porción de queso fresco y descubrió en la arquitectura su auténtica vocación”.

76,1,0.0,"In response to a tweet by Mika Brzezinski‏, the co-host of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" that emotionally leveled that accusation, Wolf said, ""Why are you guys making this about Sarah's looks?""

Wolf went on to explain that she had only joked about Sanders' using burnt ""facts"" to create a ""perfect smokey eye,"" saying, ""I complimented her eye makeup and her ingenuity

The comedian, known for her stand-up and appearances on ""The Daily Show,"" responded to other critics, too.

Wolf gently nudged Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for The New York Times, who was similarly critical of her, saying, ""Hey mags. All these jokes were about her despicable behavior. Sounds like you have some thoughts about her looks

And she thanked Sean Spicer, Sanders' predecessor as press secretary, for calling her routine ""despicable.

Also Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted that Wolf ""bombed"" at the annual dinner in Washington, DC. According to Trump, ""everyone is talking"" about how Wolf's performance was a ""very big, boring bust."" He suggested that Fox News host Greg Guftfeld host next year.

​​Gutfeld was among those who criticized Wolf after the routine. He suggested she is among the ""denigrators of women"" who ""use politics as an excuse for physical ridicule"" and said she was getting a pass because she is liberal.

Criticism of Wolf came from all directions. It started Saturday with the staffers who were in the Washington Hilton ballroom. Director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp and her husband, conservative activist Matt Schlapp, walked out in protest. They later they took to Twitter to complain.

Mercedes Schlapp called it ""shameful of Wolf to attack ""conservative women for their looks and jobs"" and said, ""It's why America hates the out of touch leftist media elite.""

​​Reince Priebus, Trump's former chief of staff, noted that ""Trump lovers and even a large number of Trump haters were pretty miserable"" during the routine. He said it validated Trump's decision to skip the dinner for the second straight year -- something no president in decades had done even once -- and instead hold a campaign-style rally in Michigan.

Many other Republicans were also appalled. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for George W. Bush and has been critical of Trump, tweeted that the routine was ""foul,"" ""uncalled for,"" and ""not funny.""

Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator and editor in chief of the Daily Wire, said Wolf was ""about as funny as stomach cancer.""

A number of Democrats were similarly -- if less colorfully -- critical. Dan Shapiro, President Barack Obama's ambassador to Israel, tweeted that while he is ""no fan"" of Sanders, ""Mean isn't funny.""

Even journalists who are paid to be critical of the White House came out against Wolf's jokes. Peter Baker, The New York Times chief White House correspondent, tweeted dismay that the dinner had not ""advanced the cause of journalism.""

Ken Herman, a columnist for the Austin American-Statesman and a former board member of the White House Correspondents' Association, which throws the event, agreed.

Kyle Cheney, a Congress reporter for Politico, said Wolf was ""unnecessarily cruel.""

Of course, some felt that Sanders and her colleagues got what they deserved. Lizz Winstead, a co-creator of ""The Daily Show"" tweeted, ""WE LOVED IT. BECAUSE THIS WH IS DESTROYING THE WORLD.""

Nathan Rubin, the founder of Millennial Politics, acknowledged that Wolf's routine may have been ""mean spirited,"" but asked why ""a comedian is held to a higher standard than the President"".

So what were the jokes that got everyone so riled up? Here are some of the doozies:

* Wolf set the evening's raunchy tone with her opening line: “Good evening, here we are at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner; like a porn star says when she’s about to have sex with Trump, let’s get this over with.”

* “It’s 2018 and I’m a woman, so you cannot shut me up, unless you have Michael Cohen wire me $130,000,” Wolf Quipped, referring to the lawyer's involvement in paying off women who alleged affairs with Trump.

* Sanders' smokey eye: ""I actually really like Sarah. I think she's very resourceful. But she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye,"" Wolf joked about Sanders. ""Like maybe she's born with it, maybe it's lies. It's probably lies.""

* Saying she wanted to make fun of the president in a new way, Wolf questioned Trump's wealth: “I don’t think you’re very rich. Like, I think you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York you’re doing fine,” Wolf said. “Trump is the only person that still watches 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' and thinks ‘me.’ Although I’m not sure you would get very far. He would get to like the third question and be like, ‘I have to phone a Fox and Friend.”

* Turning her attention to the media, Wolf said: ""You guys are obsessed with Trump. Did you used to date him? Because you pretend like you hate him, but I think you love him,"" Wolf said. ""I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you.""

* She singled out CNN host Jake Tapper: “I know there’s a lot of people that want me to talk about Russia and Putin and collusion, but I’m not gonna do that because there’s also a lot of liberal media here and I’ve never really want to know what any of you look like when you orgasm…. Except maybe you, Jake Tapper.”

* And she questioned the air time given to Conway: “Kellyanne Conway has the perfect last name for what she does: Conway,” Wolf said. “It’s like if my name was Michelle Jokes Frizzy Hair Small Tits. You guys have to stop putting Kellyanne on your shows. If you don’t give her a platform, she has nowhere to lie. It’s like that old saying: If a tree falls in the woods, how do we get Kellyanne under that tree. I’m not suggesting she gets hurt. Just stuck.”

* Wolf managed to take a shot Trump and Hillary Clinton at the same time: “It is kinda crazy that the Trump campaign was in contact with Russia when the Hillary campaign wasn’t even in contact with Michigan,” Wolf cracked. “It’s a direct flight! It’s so close!”

* Noting Trump's absence, she joked: “And I know, I know, I would drag him here myself, but it turns out the president of the United States is the one pussy you’re not allowed to grab.""

77,2,,"The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”

“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“

“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”

“We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”

The 86-year-old social scientist says accepting the impending end of most life on Earth might be the very thing needed to help us prolong it

e’re doomed,” says Mayer Hillman with such a beaming smile that it takes a moment for the words to sink in. “The outcome is death, and it’s the end of most life on the planet because we’re so dependent on the burning of fossil fuels. There are no means of reversing the process which is melting the polar ice caps. And very few appear to be prepared to say so.”

Hillman, an 86-year-old social scientist and senior fellow emeritus of the Policy Studies Institute, does say so. His bleak forecast of the consequence of runaway climate change, he says without fanfare, is his “last will and testament”. His last intervention in public life. “I’m not going to write anymore because there’s nothing more that can be said,” he says when I first hear him speak to a stunned audience at the University of East Anglia late last year.

From Malthus to the Millennium Bug, apocalyptic thinking has a poor track record. But when it issues from Hillman, it may be worth paying attention. Over nearly 60 years, his research has used factual data to challenge policymakers’ conventional wisdom. In 1972, he criticised out-of-town shopping centres more than 20 years before the government changed planning rules to stop their spread. In 1980, he recommended halting the closure of branch line railways – only now are some closed lines reopening. In 1984, he proposed energy ratings for houses – finally adopted as government policy in 2007. And, more than 40 years ago, he presciently challenged society’s pursuit of economic growth.

When we meet at his converted coach house in London, his classic Dawes racer still parked hopefully in the hallway (a stroke and a triple heart bypass mean he is – currently – forbidden from cycling), Hillman is anxious we are not side-tracked by his best-known research, which challenged the supremacy of the car.

“With doom ahead, making a case for cycling as the primary mode of transport is almost irrelevant,” he says. “We’ve got to stop burning fossil fuels. So many aspects of life depend on fossil fuels, except for music and love and education and happiness. These things, which hardly use fossil fuels, are what we must focus on.”

While the focus of Hillman’s thinking for the last quarter-century has been on climate change, he is best known for his work on road safety. He spotted the damaging impact of the car on the freedoms and safety of those without one – most significantly, children – decades ago. Some of his policy prescriptions have become commonplace – such as 20mph speed limits – but we’ve failed to curb the car’s crushing of children’s liberty. In 1971, 80% of British seven- and eight-year-old children went to school on their own; today it’s virtually unthinkable that a seven-year-old would walk to school without an adult. As Hillman has pointed out, we’ve removed children from danger rather than removing danger from children – and filled roads with polluting cars on school runs. He calculated that escorting children took 900m adult hours in 1990, costing the economy £20bn each year. It will be even more expensive today.

Our society’s failure to comprehend the true cost of cars has informed Hillman’s view on the difficulty of combatting climate change. But he insists that I must not present his thinking on climate change as “an opinion”. The data is clear; the climate is warming exponentially. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that the world on its current course will warm by 3C by 2100. Recent revised climate modelling suggested a best estimate of 2.8C but scientists struggle to predict the full impact of the feedbacks from future events such as methane being released by the melting of the permafrost.

Hillman is amazed that our thinking rarely stretches beyond 2100. “This is what I find so extraordinary when scientists warn that the temperature could rise to 5C or 8C. What, and stop there? What legacies are we leaving for future generations? In the early 21st century, we did as good as nothing in response to climate change. Our children and grandchildren are going to be extraordinarily critical.”

Global emissions were static in 2016 but the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was confirmed as beyond 400 parts per million, the highest level for at least three million years (when sea levels were up to 20m higher than now). Concentrations can only drop if we emit no carbon dioxide whatsoever, says Hillman. “Even if the world went zero-carbon today that would not save us because we’ve gone past the point of no return.”

Although Hillman has not flown for more than 20 years as part of a personal commitment to reducing carbon emissions, he is now scornful of individual action which he describes as “as good as futile”. By the same logic, says Hillman, national action is also irrelevant “because Britain’s contribution is minute. Even if the government were to go to zero carbon it would make almost no difference.”

Instead, says Hillman, the world’s population must globally move to zero emissions across agriculture, air travel, shipping, heating homes – every aspect of our economy – and reduce our human population too. Can it be done without a collapse of civilisation? “I don’t think so,” says Hillman. “Can you see everyone in a democracy volunteering to give up flying? Can you see the majority of the population becoming vegan? Can you see the majority agreeing to restrict the size of their families?”

Hillman doubts that human ingenuity can find a fix and says there is no evidence that greenhouse gases can be safely buried. But if we adapt to a future with less – focusing on Hillman’s love and music – it might be good for us. “And who is ‘we’?” asks Hillman with a typically impish smile. “Wealthy people will be better able to adapt but the world’s population will head to regions of the planet such as northern Europe which will be temporarily spared the extreme effects of climate change. How are these regions going to respond? We see it now. Migrants will be prevented from arriving. We will let them drown.”

A small band of artists and writers, such as Paul Kingsnorth’s Dark Mountain project, have embraced the idea that “civilisation” will soon end in environmental catastrophe but only a few scientists – usually working beyond the patronage of funding bodies, and nearing the end of their own lives – have suggested as much. Is Hillman’s view a consequence of old age, and ill health? “I was saying these sorts of things 30 years ago when I was hale and hearty,” he says.

Hillman accuses all kinds of leaders – from religious leaders to scientists to politicians – of failing to honestly discuss what we must do to move to zero-carbon emissions. “I don’t think they can because society isn’t organised to enable them to do so. Political parties’ focus is on jobs and GDP, depending on the burning of fossil fuels.”

Without hope, goes the truism, we will give up. And yet optimism about the future is wishful thinking, says Hillman. He believes that accepting that our civilisation is doomed could make humanity rather like an individual who recognises he is terminally ill. Such people rarely go on a disastrous binge; instead, they do all they can to prolong their lives.

Can civilisation prolong its life until the end of this century? “It depends on what we are prepared to do.” He fears it will be a long time before we take proportionate action to stop climatic calamity. “Standing in the way is capitalism. Can you imagine the global airline industry being dismantled when hundreds of new runways are being built right now all over the world? It’s almost as if we’re deliberately attempting to defy nature. We’re doing the reverse of what we should be doing, with everybody’s silent acquiescence, and nobody’s batting an eyelid.”

Thiago Neves festeja fim da ""maldição"" com dois gols sobre a Universidad de Chile    TN30 marca duas vezes diante da La U e volta a balançar a rede na Libertadores após 10 anos           A goleada do Cruzeiro diante da Universidad de Chile acabou com o jejum de vitórias do time celeste na Libertadores e também com a seca de gols de Thiago Neves na competição. Único jogador a fazer três gols em uma partida final de Libertadores, fato que ocorreu em 2008, na vitória por 3 a 1 do Fluminense sobre a LDU, TN30 não marcava no torneio continental desde aquela partida, quando a equipe tricolor foi vice-campeão.           Thiago Neves recebe o Globo Esporte em sua casa e comenta noite histórica do Cruzeiro       Na terça-feira passada, Thiago Neves chegou a ""cravar"" que, diante da La U, a sua ""maldição"" pessoal iria acabar. E terminou com grande estilo: dois gols e goleada do Cruzeiro, por 7 a 0 - a maior do clube na história da Libertadores. Nesta sexta-feira, o meia recebeu o Globo Esporte em sua casa e falou sobre a boa atuação dele e da equipe celeste no Mineirão.     - Falei que ia ser tudo diferente, que tudo ia mudar na quinta-feira. Foi tudo perfeito. Uma goleada maravilhosa, com o time jogando muito bem. Foi também para acabar com a maldição, agora volta tudo ao normal. Daqui para frente, que seja cada jogo um golzinho (risos) - disse Thiago Neves, em entrevista à TV Globo Minas.               Thiago Neves: aliviado com o fim da ""maldição"" na Libertadores (Foto: Reprodução / Globo Minas)         O jejum de gols do Cruzeiro em 2018 vinha desde a final do Campeonato Mineiro, no início de abril. Na ocasição, inclusive, Thiago Neves marcou um dos gols que deu o título do Estadual à Raposa. Decisivo, mais uma vez, nessa quinta, o meia chegou à artilharia do time nesta temporada, com sete gols.     - Eu me preparo para jogos decisivos. Óbvio que eu me preparo para todos, mas tem momentos que você tem que ter uma preparação a mais, ficar mais concentrado, mais focado. Eu procurei fazer isso nesses dias, porque foi uma semana meio conturbada, com os resultados ruins. Mas fui contratado para isso: ser um dos principais jogadores do Cruzeiro. Nesses momentos, quando o time precisa, eu tenho que corresponder. Ontem deu tudo certo. Feliz pela minha atuação, pelos gols, mas mais feliz pelos três pontos e pelo jogo que a gente fez.      Nos minutos finais do jogo contra a Universidad do Chile, Thiago Neves colocou a mão na coxa direita e até mancou. Na saída de campo, porém, tranquilizou a torcida. Em entrevista à TV Globo Minas, ressaltou que não foi nada de mais.    - Foi só um incômodo na hora que dei uma arrancada. Só uma dor na posterior direita, nada muito grave. O médico, depois, deu uma avaliada. Já comecei o tratamento, mas nada que possa preocupar para os próximos jogos.     Thiago Neves, que vem de oito jogos seguidos como titular, pode ser poupado neste domingo, no duelo com o Internacional, pela terceira rodada do Campeonato Brasileiro. Pergutado sobre uma possível ausência na partida em Porto Alegre, ele se esquivou.           Melhores momentos: Cruzeiro 7 x 0 Universidad de Chile pela 4ª rodada da Libertadores        - Eu não sei ainda. O Mano vai decidir nesses dois dias. Tenho que me recuperar. Tenho hoje e amanhã para me preparar. Mas, quero estar à disposição no domingo. Independetemente se for jogar ou não, quero estar com todo mundo, até para passar incentivo para a galera. Se for para estar em campo, pode ter certeza que vou mitar.       Seja Sócio do Time do Povo - clique aqui

85,2,1.0,"While it will likely take the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons weeks or even months to issue their final report on the alleged gas attack in Douma (an attack for which journalists and other independent parties have failed to find any evidence), the organization's investigators have apparently spoken with Russian military officials after visiting the site of the Barzeh research center in Damascus - one of the three facilities targeted by the strikes.

The Barzah Research and Development Center in Damascus, Syria, before it was struck by coalition forces on Saturday.

The Barzah facility after it was struck by coalition forces.

At the time we noted Paul Craig Roberts' 'awkward question' to Washington's warmongers:

If this were true, would not a lethal cloud have been released that would have taken the lives of far more people than claimed in the alleged Syrian chemical attack on Douma?

Would not the US missile attack be identical to a chemical weapons attack and thus place the US and its vassals in the same category as Washington is attempting to place Assad and Putin?

And now, according to Sputnik, the investigators, who spoke with Russian General Staff Col. Gen. Sergey Rudskoy, revealed that they had found no evidence of chemical weapons in the remains of research facilities that were supposedly integral to the Syrian Army's chemical weapons program. Of course, this shouldn't come as a surprise: After all, if the US, France and the UK really did bomb a building filled with chemical weapons, there would've been thousands - possibly tens of thousands - of bodies to show for it.

""Immediately after the attacks, many people who worked at these destroyed facilities and just bystanders without any protective equipment visited them. None of them got poisoned with toxic agents,"" Rudskoy said.

Rudskoy said there was similarly scant evidence of chemical weapons exposure at the Han Shinshar facility, located in the province of Homs. Russia registered only seven missiles had struck the facility, while the Pentagon claimed that it had successfully fired 22 missiles. Russia has previously claimed that only 71 of 103 missiles launched by the coalition made it past Syria's antiquated air defenses.

""According to the statements of the Pentagon’s representatives, 22 missiles hit the above-ground facilities. We registered no more than seven hits, which is shown in the space image,"" he told a briefing.

Furthermore, the Russian Reconciliation Center for Syria said its representatives had questioned local doctors and investigated the site of the attacks. The doctors confirmed that they hadn't recently treated any patients with signs of exposure to chemical agents, and investigators searching the area found nothing suspicious. Moscow had said the April 7 gas attack that purportedly took place in Douma, part of the Eastern Ghouta region that was recently reclaimed following a military victory over the last rebel forces in the area, was in fact staged by the White Helmets, an NGO that supports US interests in Syria under the guise of altruism. While the US has refused to share the supposedly ""slam dunk"" evidence that the Syrian government was behind the attack, US and French authorities have cited videos posted to YouTube by the White Helmets as sufficient proof of an attack.

But as Ron Paul argued in a recent column, even if the Syrian army did carry out the gas attack in Douma, evidence of this still wouldn't justify the US, UK and France bombing targets inside a foreign country.

The Syrian civil war has been a bloody one. Hundreds of thousands of combatants (and tens of thousands of civilians) have been blown up by airstrikes, ripped to pieces by shrapnel or mutilated and murdered in some other grotesque fashion. The problem is, the US intervention wasn't motivated by humanitarian instincts - rather, Washington's outrage is very selective and politically motivated.

We are not the policemen of the world, Paul added. Bad leaders do terrible things all the time - and this is true even in the US. The US has neither the moral authority - or the money - to carry out overseas bombings. Especially now that it has become clear the Trump administration didn't have sound evidence of an attack, the hasty decision to resort to force was a foolish one.

Russia may see a hike in health care, education and infrastructure spending by around $162 billion in the next six years, with cuts in its military spending, according to a report on Vladimir Putin's plan for his term in office.

The 10 trillion rubles ($162 billion) spending plan has been under consideration for several months now and is expected to become a decree shortly after Putin's inauguration on May 7, sources familiar with the issue told the Bloomberg agency, on condition of anonymity.

The measure is aimed at achieving the ""decisive breakthrough"" in raising the living standards of the Russian population, which was promised by the President in his annual address last month. It's also an attempt to stimulate the growth of the country's' economy amid its slow recovery from recession and from Western sanctions, the sources said.

The funds allocated for construction and maintenance of roads, as well as other transport infrastructure, will increase by about a third, the people said. A 20 percent increase in spending on health care and education is also part of the plan, they added.

This means that Russia will be investing around 11.3 percent of its GDP in infrastructure, health care and education over the next six years, compared to the 9 percent it currently invests.

The increased spending in those areas will be compensated by cuts in others, including defense, as well as by possible tax hikes, according to the sources. A new 4 percent sales tax may be among the options, they said, adding that this measure hasn't yet been approved.

The allocation of the new funds may start this year, but the largest increases should be expected after 2020, the sources said. They also warned that the figures in the plan may still be adjusted in the coming days and could differ from the 10 trillion-ruble sum.

In January, Russia's Vedomosti newspaper also reported that the presidential administration and the relevant ministries were tasked with calculating the possibilities of increased spending on health care, education and infrastructure. According to the paper's sources, the idea was –among others– backed by presidential aide Andrey Belousov, and by the head of the Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, who said that structural reform would be required to support the measure.

89,4,0.0,"A member of the German Green Party is urging EU Governments to boycott the Russian-hosted June 2018 FIFA World Cup, in an open letter as reported on by Zero Hedge.

Her letter is filled with the age-old Russophobia spouted by smug westerners for centuries, and is in itself, nothing surprising. The letter is a self-righteous piece containing the typical praise of “western values”, and condemning Russia for various crimes she didn’t commit – without any evidence, as usual. It contains statements referencing what she considers “Vladimir Putin’s mockery of our European values“, with undertones of an implied moral high ground the west allegedly has. The entire letter can be summed up in the crowning moment of arrogance in the closing paragraph:

The world is looking at Europe in these difficult times. Our governments should not

strengthen the authoritarian and anti-western path of the Russian President, but

boycott the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and raise their voices for the protection of

human rights, of democratic values and peace.

Normally, this is a story that would fly under the radar. There are so many more important issues concerning Russia and the world, than the fantasies of a misguided woman’s desire to boycott a sporting event. Her open letter is not an official decision from the EU, although it is worth noting that according to Zero Hedge, Sixty Members of the European Parliament from 16 member states and 5 different political groups are supporting her call.

The so-called “democratic, human rights” secular powers of today – US, EU, and their allies.

PR: You said that Russian culture, in your opinion, is a European culture. But there are many conservatives who say that Russia is a separate civilization, a Eurasian civilization. Do you consider that Russia is part of European civilization, and if so does that mean that Russia’ future must lie in Europe?

MR: How to understand the idea of civilization is a big question. If you consider a civilization to be a project built around religious or quasi-religious values, some project of organizing life, the image of man, society, power, then in Europe we can see a new civilization being built, one which is connected to a new set of quasi-religious coordinates founded on the religion of human rights and emancipation. And in this sense it is a new post-Christian civilization. Again, that is if we view civilization as a project, not as roots, but as a project. But if we understand civilization in terms of its roots: antiquity, Christianity, a certain Jewish component through Biblical thought, plus Slavic, Celtic, German, Indo-European roots, myths, then we are quite close to Europe. We have common roots. And our cultural codes are also similar. If we look at Russian stories and those of the Brothers Grimm, we can see one and the same subjects. But if we see civilization as a project, then, no, we are now separate civilizations.

But there was no avoiding this snake as it was dropped onto a moving car by a hawk in Queensland.

A motorist called Joanne was driving near the Wivenhoe Dam, west of Brisbane, when the bird of prey suddenly swooped towards her vehicle.

She and her passengers screamed as the bird swept across the road with a large snake between its claws.

The driver's dash camera captured the moment the hawk let go of the serpent, sending it slamming into the windscreen.

The bird quickly took off into the skies, leaving Joanne and her friends in shock.

But their screams soon turned to laughter as they realised they were fine.

It is not clear if the hawk intended to drop the snake on the car, but it may have been employing an unorthodox method of killing its prey.

It is not known if the video is authentic.

Earlier this year another video of a hawk dropping a snake on to an unsuspecting  family in Melbourne surfaced online, but it turned out to be a fake.

The footage showed the bird chucking a large snake on to a group of people enjoying a barbecue, with the serpent then slithering off as the family screamed.

After the video amassed five million views in 48 hours, AFL club Hawthorn Hawks admitted it was a PR stunt.

As faixas podem ser divididas em ‘lado A’ e ‘lado B’: as primeiras são, digamos assim, mais ‘músicas de trabalho’, mais pops. Já no dito lado B, estariam as músicas nas quais colocamos facetas que não estão tão óbvias assim. Cada faixa representa um humor, como se fossem diferentes fases, uma variação de sentimentos em uma mesma pessoa”.

Seja como for, o plano dos integrantes é tocar. O grupo, aliás, prepara-se para lançar o clipe de “Aldeia”, ao mesmo tempo que organiza a turnê do disco no interior do Estado, bem como Brasil afora. O álbum será divulgado e distribuído pela gravadora Sony, parceira da Daparte neste período.

Foi nos últimos seis meses que a rotina da banda amadureceu: os músicos abriram para o Skank no KM de Vantagens Hall em outubro passado e participaram do line-up do “Planeta Brasil”, em janeiro deste ano.

Juliano Alvarenga, vale ressaltar, é filho de Samuel Rosa, vocalista do grupo Skank e um dos convidados do show, ao lado de Fernanda Takai (Pato Fu) e de Luis Couto, da banda Devise. Samuel, aliás, faz uma rápida análise da atual cena belo-horizontina. “O Juliano tem me apresentado muita coisa legal, interessante. Vejo os meninos muito envolvidos com a feitura dos seus próprios álbuns e apostando na música autoral”. Em tempo: no show, Samuel vai tocar “Amores Imperfeitos”, a pedido da banda.

97,1,0.0,"O sorriso escancarado que Thiago Delegado exibe na foto ao lado tem tudo a ver com a atmosfera que perpassa “Sambetes Vol.1”, disco que o violonista, compositor e arranjador lança em show na próxima quinta-feira (26), no palco do Teatro Bradesco. Quase todo autoral – à exceção da faixa “Afrosambete”, parceria com Aloizio Horta –, o álbum explicita, em seu título, o gênero ao qual se filia.

“Sambetes são sambas pequeninos, que têm uma levada do samba-jazz do final dos anos 50, anos 60 e 70. Remetem, por exemplo, a João Donato, Zimbo Trio... São composições mais curtinhas, menores, com um tema bem definido, mas com espaço para os músicos improvisarem e brincarem”, define, lembrando os vários ícones da MPB que já se filiaram a essa matriz – caso de Roberto Menescal e seu “Telefone” (música de 1964). Menescal, aliás, é o homenageado na faixa de abertura, “Sambete do Menexca”. Lembrando, ainda, que o carioca foi um dos convidados do disco anterior de Delegado, “Viamundo”.

No curso de toda essa história, o músico passou a compor já pensando na ambiência do projeto – motivo pelo qual a seleção de repertório, no caso, não foi tarefa das mais intrincadas. Das oito faixas que formatam o disco (que também está saindo em vinil), sete são instrumentais. A “estranha no ninho” responde pelo título de “Garoto Matheus” e foi composta sob o calor de um episódio ocorrido no Carnaval 2017 na capital mineira, envolvendo o músico Matheus Brant, seu amigo, e o bloco que ele capitaneia, Me Beija Que Eu Sou Pagodeiro. “Certo dia, acordei e, quando fui ver (nas redes sociais), havia todo um burburinho, com postagens de mensagens do tipo: ‘Força, Matheus’. Fui investigar o que era e achei tão absurdo! Até mesmo um pouco cômico”.

Para refrescar a memória: após um concorrido ensaio, no qual alguns foliões ficaram de fora, o organizador recebeu um e-mail de um morador do entorno (Gutierrez), com dizeres como: “Não queira arrumar problemas com quem é muito superior a você em influência e justiça”. “Um e-mail rude, grotesco, fascista”, rememora Delegado, que escreveu a letra de bate-pronto. Ao postá-la nas rede social, o conteúdo foi bastante compartilhado.

Outra faixa de história digna de registro é “Sambete da Malu”, que ele fez para a sobrinha. “Minha irmã me chamou para padrinho. Então, tinha que dar um presente e optei por fazer uma música: era menos oneroso”, gargalha. Claro, é uma piada. De todo moda, a garota aprovou: hoje, aos 2 anos, já dá seu feedback, batucando a cada audição – embora ainda insista em chamar o “dindo” de “Donegado”.

Um outro diferencial é que o disco foi gravado em um estúdio com tecnologia analógica em São João del-Rei. “A gente quis trazer uma atmosfera old school, vintage, e o estúdio que me ofereceu essa possibilidade foi esse”. Não que tenha sido fácil, o processo. “Esses sistemas têm umas complicações que são inerentes ao processo, que é mais raiz. Traz uma verdade, mas realmente é mais difícil, e a gente tinha um prazo curto. Alugamos uma casa antiga, centenária, tínhamos que matar tudo em um dia, mas achamos que a gente ia dar conta – e demos! Não foi fácil de editar, pois não permite muita maquiagem. É mesmo o nosso som e a nossa onda. Tem uma verdade que seria difícil atingir de outra forma”.

98,1,0.0,"""Quem inventou o amor? Me explica, por favor” entoava Renato Russo, em tom de quase lamento, no álbum “Uma Outra Estação” (1997), do Legião Urbana. O artista não estava só. Afinal, de onde vieram as regras do jogo nas relações amorosas? E o que, afinal, mudou com o passar do tempo? Se as perguntas parecem difíceis, as respostas podem ser divertidas – pelo menos em “A Invenção do Amor”, peça que Ana Clara Gueiros e Guilherme Piva trazem a BH no próximo sábado (28), no Teatro Bradesco.

O ator gaúcho acrescenta: “Na peça, somos um casal pré-histórico. A gente mostra um personagem extremamente machista – e nada melhor que o homem das cavernas para ser assim”. De acordo com Piva, o Croc inventa que, depois de casado, ela só pode fazer amor com ele. “Mas ele, como homem não engravida, pode fazer com outras mulheres. A Nhaca vai aceitando, mas, com o tempo, se toca que é uma relação que beneficia só uma parte. Então, começa a ativar a rebeldia, a ativar a vontade dela, a lutar por seus direitos”, completa.

O conflito do casal é uma alegoria sobre as transformações das relações amorosas ao longo do tempo. “A gente tem vivido mudanças que vêm para o bem e que, muitas vezes, partem dos questionamentos das mulheres”, analisa Maria Clara. Bem, mas e o que tem atravessado os séculos e permanecido igual? “Os relacionamentos passam por ciclos que permanecem os mesmos, é um tema universal”, avalia Piva. “As pessoas se conhecem, se gostam, casam-se, há os ciúmes, vêm os desentendimentos, os filhos, separações, reconquistas...”, enumera ele. E tudo isso, claro, está na peça.

Para cada situação que representa um desses ciclos, a montagem se vale de referências a casais icônicos da ficção ou da realidade. “Meu personagem é um Homo Sapiens e o da Maria Clara, uma mulher de Neanderthal. E eles não poderiam se relacionar... Então, fazemos uma alusão a Romeu e Julieta”, adianta Piva. Quando o assunto avança para o feminismo, eles recorrem a Lampião e Maria Bonita. “Ele ficava em casa, bordava, e ela ia para guerra”, cita o ator. Maria Clara lembra que há ainda outras referências, como à figura bíblica do Rei Salomão e a suas mil mulheres, bem como ao best-seller “Cinquenta Tons de Cinza”. Nem a psicanálise fica de fora: em crise, o terapeuta do casal é Freud Flintstone.

“O humor é essencial para falar de assuntos muito importantes, pois abre uma passagem fluida e agradável para pensar coisas muito incômodas, como o machismo”, indica Maria Clara Gueiros, sobre as críticas presentes no texto, sempre embaladas pelo riso. Piva completa: “A plateia toda já passou, está passando ou vai passar por alguma situação que retratamos... São temas universais, então, você vê casais se cutucando, dizendo: ‘olha você ali’, ‘esse é você’... Gera uma identificação e todo mundo consegue rir de si mesmo”.

Vale dizer que a primeira parceria entre os dois atores no teatro é festejada com ênfase pelas partes. “A gente é da mesma geração, fala a mesma língua”, brinda ela. O gosto pelo teatro é outro elemento que dá liga ao projeto. Piva, por exemplo, compara sua relação com o palco como um “velado amor platônico”. Já a carioca aproveita para dizer que o sentimento sobre o qual a peça gira é o mesmo que os norteia no ofício de atuar. “E as pessoas vão sair da peça pensando nele”.

99,1,0.0,"Janeiro de 2016. Denise Fraga estava em cartaz com o espetáculo “Galileu Galilei” quando, ao participar do programa “Roda Viva”, foi questionada sobre como, em um país em aguda crise econômica, continuava a lotar teatros. Se de lá pra cá a situação do Brasil não apresentou significativos sinais de melhora, vale repetir a pergunta diante do sucesso de “A Visita da Velha Senhora”, montagem que, por sete meses, lotou casas em São Paulo e no Rio.

Ela costuma dizer que “A Visita da Velha Senhora”, obra publicada em 1956 pelo suíço Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921–1990), fecha uma trilogia que, mesmo lançando mão de diferentes dramaturgos, tem na condição humana e nos valores morais a sua centralidade. Em 2008, a atriz interpretava “A Alma Boa de Setsuan”, de Bertolt Brecht (1898– 1898), onde a questão posta em cena era: “Como posso ser boa se tenho que pagar o aluguel?”. Com “Galileu Galilei”, do mesmo autor, o tema voltaria na perspectiva sobre como ser fiel a seus ideais sem ceder aos poderes políticos e econômicos vigentes? Agora, com “A Visita...”, o questionamento é revisitado: “É uma tragicomédia brilhante, hilária e terrível, que faz pensar até onde vamos por dinheiro? Que horas dizemos que daqui não passo? Será que existe quem não se renda?”, argumenta.

A obra que inspirou Jorge Amado em “Tieta do Agreste” (1977) seria, segundo Denise, espantosamente adequada “ao momento do Brasil”. “É uma dramaturgia que vai ser sempre atual”, examina, pontuando que o texto perpassa reflexões sobre “os limites entre justiça e vingança” e “até onde se vai por dinheiro”. Para ela, “a peça não só é atual”, como é propício o ensejo de encená-la agora. “É assustador! Dependendo do dia, fica parecendo que estamos adaptando o noticiário, mas não: é um texto escrito em 1955”.

Ao lado de Denise, o ator pernambucano Tuca Andrada não sai de cena durante todo espetáculo. Ele também se surpreende com a pertinência do conteúdo. “Parece ter sido feito mês passado!”, diz. “É uma trama que traz a atenção do público e põe em cena questões como: o que é ser justo? A quem serve a justiça? São assuntos oportunos para agora, para fazer efeito sobre nossa realidade”.

Se o próprio autor da trama já havia apontado que nada estragaria mais “A Visita da Velha Senhora” que o fato de ela não ser levada como uma comédia, Denise Fraga – que é dirigida por seu marido, Luiz Villaça – acredita que a empreitada está no caminho certo. A carioca lembra que chegou ao texto de Dürrenmatt através do autor das peças antecessoras. “Ele é muito brechtiano, é até mais explícito que o Brecht. Tem uma coisa nele que me atrai e que me causa identificação, que é querer se divertir com o público”, assegura.

Tuca lembra que muitas das questões presentes da peça já vêm sendo debatidas exaustivamente. Por isso, para ele, o humor é um dos grandes trunfos, pois, assim, a discussão se re-habilita. “A única maneira de atingir as pessoas é pelo humor. Se o tom fosse dramático talvez não fosse tão bom”. A reação das pessoas é outro aspecto que ele destaca. “Você vai vendo que as risadas vão diminuindo – e o que começa como um riso de uma comédia vai ficando mais tenso, mais nervoso. É aí que a gente nota que está ‘pegando as pessoas pelo pé’”, comenta.

Denise, aliás, tem até um nome para o tipo de risada que ouve da plateia. “É a ‘gargalhada pior que é’: aquela risada que acaba no meio, porque começa a haver reconhecimento e, de repente, você pensa ‘pior que é assim mesmo’... E o riso morre”, explica. Este reconhecimento, por sinal, fica mais latente com o trabalho de Villaça, que inclui o público em cenas. O resultado é que, depois de assistir à peça, “muita gente continua no saguão, falando sobre o texto, fazendo teses... Acho que é porque é uma facada – mas é uma facada deliciosa”.

E se o assunto não se esgota, a discussão continua fora do teatro – inclusive nas redes sociais. “Na minha página no Facebook e no perfil do espetáculo no Instagram, as pessoas continuam as discussões, um retorno incrível”, comemora.

Tuca reconhece: “Sempre fui louco para trabalhar com a Denise no teatro... Já havia feito com ela ‘Retrato Falado’, um quadro do ‘Fantástico’ (Rede Globo). Ela é uma atriz que escolhe bem e se arrisca, gosto de gente que se propõe a isso”. A carioca, por sua vez, também é só elogios ao ator e ao elenco como um todo. “São 13 pessoas em cena, todos mais ou menos da mesma idade, somos quase uma companhia”, brinca.

La mannequine, créée en avril 2017 à partir d’effets spéciaux numériques, est suivie par plus de 100 000 personnes sur Instagram.

Charlotte Herzog

Sur son compte, une vingtaine de publications ont suscité 10 000 réactions par post en moyenne. Pour certains, elle est la diversité, elle est fascinante. Pour d’autres, elle est un danger, une impostrice, carrément flippante.

Car la particularité de Shudu Gram, c’est qu’elle est une mannequine virtuelle au corps redimensionné et au cou princier, qui prend racine dans un vieil archétype : la poupée. Beauté figurative et insondable. Peau ébène sans aucun défaut.

Créée à partir d’effets spéciaux, 100 % générée par ordinateur, Shudu Gram est la « création artistique » du photographe londonien Cameron-James Wilson, qui a souhaité donner vie à « un fantasme qui deviendrait la réalité dans notre monde filtré, où le réel devient faux ».

Inspirée de la Barbie sud-africaine, et des mannequines comme Alek Wek, Duckie Thot ou Grace Jones, Shudu Gram « n’est pas vouée à remplacer qui que ce soit », précise son créateur.

Comme le souligne la revue de tweets du Huffington Post, la démarche a provoqué un « tollé sur les réseaux ». Sur Twitter, des internautes ont déploré une approche jugée parfois raciste : « Un photographe blanc a trouvé le moyen de tirer profit des femmes noires sans jamais avoir à en payer une » ; « Un photographe blanc a trouvé le moyen de tirer profit des femmes noires sans jamais avoir à en payer une » ; « Les modèles noires, en particulier celles qui ont la peau foncée, ne sont pas une mode. Nous devrions être la norme » ; « Ça montre à quel point aussi les peaux noires sont toujours aussi exotiques aux yeux des médias. »

Interrogé par le Harper’s Bazaar, le photographe dit avoir « juste » souhaité « ajouter quelque chose en plus au mouvement du moment des mannequines à la peau foncée ». Et il insiste : Shudu Gram ne fait pas que s’en inspirer, elle les « représente ».

@TheAffinityMag We are not a 'trend' or 'movement' https://t.co/tODPKFT9i5— OhwGE (@Kitsune)

Pour Julien Fournié, couturier français à la tête de la maison de couture homonyme et désigneur au FashionLab de Dassault Systèmes, un éditeur de logiciels spécialisé dans la conception 3D, il n’y aurait pourtant rien de bien nouveau : « La diversité n’est plus un problème dans le monde de la mode. Les barrières sont baissées. Il n’y a plus de diktat. Des noires, des métisses, des rousses, des blanches. Des grandes, des petites, des rondes. Des femmes qui portent le voile… » Alors, pourquoi pas des avatars ?

Pas vraiment nouveau mais sérieusement émergent, ce phénomène de mannequines 2.0, recensé par le site du magazine Vogue, n’étonne ni n’inquiète Julien Fournié, qui constate qu’un buzz existe et dure autour de la virtualité :

Le phénomène de dématérialisation des ambassadrices de la mode ne semble ainsi pas en être un aux yeux du couturier. « Il y a toujours eu des phénomènes. Et des gens avec des histoires de gros sous — dont je n’ai pas envie de parler — pour s’emparer des nouvelles choses », soupirerait presque Julien Fournié, faisant référence à la marque de maquillage de Rihanna, Fenty Beauty, qui a utilisé Shudu Gram comme égérie pour mieux vendre son rouge à lèvres.

Shudu Gram est-elle meilleure ou pire qu’un mannequin réel ? Qu’un influenceur réel ? Car « Instagram, ce n’est pas vous. Pas eux. C’est juste la version numérique d’une personne », comme l’explique à la BBC Justin Rezvani, le fondateur de TheAmplify, une agence marketing qui met en relation les marques avec des influenceurs.

D’un point de vue technologique, la création de mannequins virtuels donne l’occasion aux créateurs de pouvoir rêver n’importe quel corps et de mieux s’adapter aux corps réels qui changent. « Les femmes grandissent, prennent des épaules, des hanches, et c’est génial. Le virtuel, c’est juste une avancée de plus. On est obligé de travailler avec les nouvelles technologies, dit Julien Fournié. Mais l’essence de la couture et de la mode restera toujours la quête de définir ce qu’il y a de meilleur chez chacun(e). »

Avant de revenir à celui dont les compétences techniques créent plus de polémiques que d’éloges véritables :

Première greffe de pénis et de scrotum au monde réalisée aux Etats-Unis

L’équipe de chirurgiens a « bon espoir » que le bénéficiaire puisse retrouver des fonctions sexuelles et urinaires quasi normales.

La première greffe de pénis et de scrotum au monde a été pratiquée le mois dernier aux Etats-Unis sur un militaire américain blessé en Afghanistan, ont annoncé lundi 23 avril des médecins de l’université Johns Hopkins.

Pendant quatorze heures le 26 mars, une équipe de neuf chirurgiens esthétiques et deux chirurgiens urologues a opéré le patient. « Nous avons bon espoir que cette greffe aide à rétablir des fonctions sexuelles et urinaires presque normales chez ce jeune homme », a déclaré W. P. Andrew Lee, professeur et directeur du département de chirurgie plastique et reconstructrice à l’école de médecine de l’université.

Le pénis, le scrotum sans les testicules et une partie de la paroi abdominale venaient d’un donneur mort. Le bénéficiaire a requis l’anonymat mais dans un bref communiqué, il a indiqué qu’il devait quitter l’hôpital la semaine prochaine. Le communiqué n’a pas précisé les conditions dans lesquelles l’homme a été blessé, mais a indiqué que de telles blessures pouvaient être causées par des engins explosifs improvisés.

La première greffe de pénis au monde avait été pratiquée en Chine en 2006, mais le bénéficiaire avait dû être de nouveau opéré pour l’enlever en raison de « graves problèmes psychologiques » l’ayant affecté, ainsi que son épouse. C’est en 2015 et en Afrique du Sud que la première greffe réussie de pénis au monde a été annoncée. Les Etats-Unis ont suivi en 2016.

Alice Paquet réagit aux révélations de la nouvelle victime de Gerry Sklavounos

«Bon courage Maude-Félixe. Tu es une guerrière.»

Alice Paquet raconte avoir reçu des messages dégueulasses et blessants à la suite de sa dénonciation, en octobre 2016.

QUÉBEC – La première victime qui a dénoncé le député de Laurier-Dorion, Gerry Sklavounos, salue le courage de la jeune militante libérale qui brise maintenant le silence pour dénoncer le harcèlement sexuel de l'élu qui est toujours en poste.

Alice Paquet avait pris la parole le 19 octobre 2016, lors d'une vigie en soutien aux survivantes d'agressions sexuelles à l'Université Laval, pour dénoncer le comportement d'un député toujours en poste. Les médias ont rapidement découvert qu'elle parlait de M. Sklavounos et il a été exclu du caucus libéral.

«J'ai fait des entrevues dont je ne me souviens même pas tellement j'étais en choc post-traumatique, écrit la jeune femme dans une publication sur Facebook. Carrément, il y a un mois complet de flou total à la suite de ma dénonciation tellement je n'étais ""plus là"".»

Dénoncer une agression sexuelle publiquement, c'est aussi les trolls et les commentaires méchants qui viennent avec.

Mme Paquet ne veut pas revenir sur les faits allégués, mais déplore toujours la façon dont elle a été traînée dans la boue à la suite de son témoignage. Quelques jours après sa dénonciation, le Journal de Québec révélait qu'elle avait déjà été escorte, comme si cette information avait une incidence sur l'agression dont elle dit avoir été victime.

«Cet article a fourni les radios poubelles et les mauvaises langues en bile pour qu'ils puissent, un vomi à la fois, achever ce qu'il me restait de courage. On me reconnaissait dans la rue, au restaurant. Les journalistes téléphonaient ma mère pour savoir comment j'arrivais à payer mon loyer.»

Quelques mois plus tard, le directeur des poursuites criminelles et pénales a conclu que M. Sklavounos n'avait commis «aucun acte criminel» à l'endroit de Mme Paquet.

Embrassée de force et invitée dans sa chambre

Dans les derniers jours, la jeune militante libérale Maude-Félixe Gagnon a allégué avoir été elle aussi victime des comportements inappropriés de M. Sklavounos alors qu'elle n'avait que 15 ans.

Elle a confié à La Presse que le député l'aurait invité à son bureau de l'Assemblée nationale pour lui prendre la cuisse, l'embrasser de force et lui demander si elle avait déjà eu des relations sexuelles. Il l'aurait ensuite invitée à souper et a suggéré d'aller dans sa chambre pour «jouer aux échecs».

L'adolescente dit avoir refusé l'invitation, mais aurait continué de recevoir des messages textes de la part du député, que La Presse a pu consulter.

Alice Paquet dit être en contact avec Maude-Félixe Gagnon, maintenant âgée de 18 ans, parce qu'elle sait «un peu ce qui l'attend» après une dénonciation publique du genre, même si elle espère que les choses ont changé un peu dans la foulée du mouvement «Moi aussi».

«Je les ai tous reçus les messages. Les choses les plus blessantes et dégueulasses au monde ont atterri dans ma boîte de message. Encore aujourd'hui, parfois. Dénoncer une agression sexuelle publiquement, c'est aussi les trolls et les commentaires méchants qui viennent avec.»

Mme Paquet se dit attristée par les révélations que M. Sklavounos ait toujours son poste de député et qu'il aura droit à une indemnité de départ à la fin de son mandat.

«Bon courage Maude-Félixe. Tu es une guerrière», conclut Alice Paquet.

Une présumée victime de Gerry Sklavounos brise le silence

La militante libérale avait 15 ans à l’époque.

PC

Le député de Laurier-Dorion, Gerry Sklavounos, aurait entretenu une relation inappropriée avec une jeune militante.

QUÉBEC – Une jeune militante libérale qui aurait eu une «relation inappropriée» avec le député de Laurier-Dorion, Gerry Sklavounos, brise le silence pour défendre la gestion des cas d'inconduite sexuelle au sein de son parti.

Maude-Félixe Gagnon avait 15 ans à l'époque où les faits allégués se seraient produits. Mais ces informations n'ont refait surface qu'en novembre dernier, alors que le premier ministre Philippe Couillard envisageait de réintégrer M. Sklavounos dans le caucus libéral.

Les libéraux ont finalement décidé qu'il allait terminer son mandat comme député indépendant, à la lumière de ces allégations.

Facebook/Maude-Félixe Gagnon

Malgré son jeune âge, Maude-Félixe Gagnon est impliquée au Parti libéral depuis quelques années déjà.

Mme Gagnon a pris la parole pour la première fois par le biais des réseaux sociaux, mercredi en soirée, pour confirmer que c'était bien elle dont il s'agissait.

«Presque trois ans après les faits, je suis enfin en paix avec ce qui s'est passé, écrit la jeune femme de 18 ans. Non, ce n'est pas de ma faute, non je n'ai pas couru après, non ce n'est pas moi qui a quelque chose à me reprocher.»

Elle précise qu'elle ne donnera pas plus de détails sur ce qui s'est passé sur la place publique et a refusé notre demande d'entrevue en soirée.

Pas de «cover-up» dans son cas

À la suite des allégations d'inconduite sexuelle à l'endroit du député d'Argenteuil, Yves St-Denis, en 2014, des députées de la Coalition avenir Québec se sont interrogées à savoir pourquoi le Parti libéral du Québec avait attendu si longtemps avant de réagir.

Les caquistes Geneviève Guilbault et Lise Lavallée ont dit croire à un «cover-up» de la part des libéraux sur cette affaire.

M. St-Denis a été forcé de se retirer du caucus libéral mardi. Le HuffPost Québec révélait mercredi que sa cousine l'accuse également d'attouchements sexuels survenus en 1988.

Mme Gagnon dit que la situation a été très différente lorsque les informations la concernant ont été mises sur la place publique.

«Au contraire, j'ai été accompagnée tout au long du processus de dénonciation. J'ai été encouragée à porter plainte, à en parler à des professionnels», a-t-elle dit, en précisant que les instances du parti l'ont écoutée «sans jugement» et se sont assurées qu'elle allait bien.

Malgré son jeune âge, Mme Gagnon est une militante libérale depuis plusieurs années. Elle a travaillé au bureau de circonscription de la ministre Marie Montpetit et s'implique auprès de la Commission-Jeunesse du PLQ. Elle soutient qu'elle fait cette déclaration de son propre gré.

M. Sklavounos n'était pas disponible dans l'immédiat pour faire des commentaires.

108,4,1.0,"Donald Trump’s immigration plan is set to be announced later this week. And if previous comments are any indication, the Republican presidential contender said he plans to focus on deporting criminals, similar to the current strategy of the Obama administration.

""On Day One, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country,"" he said at Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride event Saturday in Des Moines, saying he would not focus on the 11 million undocumented residents who have lived in the U. S. for a long time without incident.

Trump has not given specific details about his immigration policy plans, but is expected to explain more Wednesday.

Based on statements so far, Trump's plan to remove the undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes is similar to what President Obama declared in 2014. Here's a look at some of the numbers:

President Barack Obama has often been referred to by immigration groups as the ""Deporter in Chief.""

Between 2009 and 2015 his administration has removed more than 2.5 million people through immigration orders, which doesn’t include the number of people who ""self-deported"" or were turned away and/or returned to their home country at the border by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

According to governmental data, the Obama administration has deported more people than any other president's administration in history.

In fact, they have deported more than the sum of all the presidents of the 20th century.

President George W. Bush's administration deported just over two million during his time in office; and Obama’s numbers don’t reflect his last year in office, for which data is not yet available.

President Obama directed U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to focus on criminals, not families, during his November 2014 executive action on immigration.

According to their website, ""ICE has continued to increase its focus on identifying, arresting, and removing convicted criminals in prisons and jails, and also at-large arrests in the interior.""

In fiscal year 2015, 91 percent of people removed from inside the U. S. were previously convicted of a crime.

The administration made the first priority ""threats to national security, border security, and public safety."" That includes gang members, convicted felons or charged with ""aggravated felony"" and anyone apprehended at the border trying to enter the country illegally.

In 2015, 81 percent, or 113,385, of the removals were the priority one removals.

Priority two includes ""misdemeanants and new immigration violators.""

That includes ""aliens convicted of three or more misdemeanor offenses, other than minor traffic"" violations, as well as those convicted of domestic violence, sexual abuse, burglary, DUIs or drug trafficking.

With the focus on criminals and not families, the administration has moved away from those living and working in the U. S. without a criminal history.

""Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who’s working hard to provide for her kids. We’ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day,"" Obama said in November 2014 when announcing his executive action on immigration.

And while he tried to provide relief and a way ""out of the shadows"" for those without criminal histories with his immigration action, that was eventually stricken down by the Supreme Court not issuing a decision on the case, thereby upholding the lower courts action.

But by refocusing on criminals most families who are living and following the law are not targets for deportations.

Priority three for the administration is focused on those who have arrived after January 1, 2014. The administration has focused on preventing families from sending their children unaccompanied on a dangerous trek by emphasizing they will be returned.

Many of these unaccompanied children and mothers with children are fleeing violence in central America—coming from the northern triangle of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, some of the most dangerous countries in the world.

Many of the people migrating from that area to the U. S. claim refugee status and, if they can prove real harm will result in their being returned, they are allowed to remain until their case is heard.

There are critics, however, who state that many are not getting a fair shot at claiming refugee status and are being returned too hastily.

112,2,1.0,"The U. S., U.K. and France bombed multiple targets in Syria Friday night in response to an alleged chemical weapons attacks by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Where did the missiles hit?

U. S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Marine General Joseph Dunford said three main chemical weapons facilities were targeted at 9 p.m. EST by missiles from both the sea and aircraft, which triggered Syrian air defenses.

U. S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (L) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford (R) brief members of the media on Syria at the Pentagon April 13, 2018 in Arlington, Virginia.

The Pentagon could not confirm how many missiles hit their targets.

* A scientific research facility in Damascus, allegedly connected to the production of chemical and biological weapons

* A chemical weapons equipment storage site and an important command post, also near Homs

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) told Reuters a second research facility was also struck in Damascus, in addition to a third in the Homs area, and five military bases and depots used by elite army divisions in the Mezzeh area of Damascus.

Syrian state TV said air defenses were confronting the attack and had shot down 13 missiles in the Kiswah area south of Damascus. It said a pro-Damascus “anti-terror axis” was confronting the attack, language suggesting that Assad’s ally Russia may be helping to fend off the assault.

U. S. officials said there was no indication so far that Syrian air defenses struck attacking Western aircraft or ships.

French and British planes also took part in the operation, marking the first time the western powers have engaged in coordinated military action against the Assad regime.

Last year, the U. S. launched missile strikes on a Syrian air base in response to a sarin gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun.

Friday's strikes were launched in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack in the town of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, one week ago, which the U. S. and its allies have blamed on the Syrian government. Damascus has denied responsibility for the attack, and Russia said that a western military response risked provoking war.

Mattis said Friday's attack was about double the size of that launched by the U. S. in April, 2017, and that Tomahawk cruise missiles were used against multiple Syrian targets.

Were there any casualties?

Mattis and Dunford acknowledged the strike was designed to degrade Syria’s chemical weapons capability without killing civilians or the many foreign fighters in Syria’s multi-sided civil war, particularly those from Russia.

“We specifically identified these targets to mitigate the risk of Russian forces being involved,” Dunford told reporters, adding the U. S. military advised Russia of airspace that would be used in the strike but did not “pre-notify them.”

The Russian Defence Ministry said there was “no evidence” of civilian or military casualties from the airstrikes.

Mattis said there was no evidence of U. S. losses in the operation.

SOHR Director Rami Abdulrahman told Reuters all the targeted locations were evacuated three days ago after the Russians told the government they had intelligence that bases including the research centers would be hit. He said there were so far no reports of civilian or military casualties,

Will there be more strikes?

Mattis said that ""right now, this is a one-time shot"". Gen Dunford confirmed the wave of strikes had ended.

In an address Friday night, President Donald Trump said that Washington was prepared to “sustain” pressure on the Assad regime until it stopped its use of chemical weapons against its own people.

What has the reaction been?

Russia warned of “consequences” in the wake of the attack.

""The U. S. - the possessor of the biggest arsenal of chemical weapons - has no moral right to blame other countries,"" the Russian embassy in the U.S. said in a statement.

President Vladimir Putin said Russia will call an emergency session of UN Security Council over strike on Syria, adding that the airstrikes on Syria early Saturday is an ""act of aggression"" against a sovereign state.

Syria released video of President Bashar al-Assad, whose Russian- and Iranian-backed forces have already driven his enemies from Syria’s major towns and cities, arriving at work as usual, with the caption “morning of resilience.""

The NATO Secretary General, Jen Stoltenberg, tweeted support for the strikes, saying those who use chemical weapons ""must be held accountable.""

115,2,0.0,"A California school district says that parents can’t opt out of a new sex education course that will deal with abortion, homosexuality and transgender issues.

California passed a law called the California Healthy Youth Act in 2015 to promote “healthy attitudes” about “gender [and] sexual orientation.” The law is meant to teach students about the “effectiveness and safety of all FDA-approved contraceptive methods” and allow for “objective discussion” about “parenting, adoption, and abortion.”

The law also gives parents the ability to opt-out of this education and said that the “pupil” shall not be punished academically in any way if they don’t participate.

However, the Orange County Board of Education has decided that parents don’t have a right to exclude their kids from the class, LifeSite News reports. A memo from the Orange County Department of Education general counsel Ronald Wenkart on March 29 stated that the opt-out provision “does not apply to instruction, materials, or programming that discusses gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, discrimination, harassment, bullying, intimidation, relationships, or family and does not discuss human reproductive organs.”

And parents who disagree with any “materials related to gender, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation may not excuse their children from this instruction,” Wenkart added. He also cited judicial precedent for the decision.

“Parents do not have a constitutional right to excuse their children from portions of the school curriculum that they find objectionable,” he continued.

The state-approved “tool kit” for the course includes topics about lubricants, anal sex and sex toys, according to Red State.

“What if you don’t have time or money to buy sex toys?” the guide reads on page C-51. “Cucumbers, carrots, and bananas (with the peel) make great dildos. Just remember to use a condom!”

Also approved is a book about transgender kids called “I Am Jazz.” Resources listed in the guide include Planned Parenthood and Advocates for Youth.

A national Sex-ed Sit Out protest has been planned on April 23 as a way for people to make their voices heard. Parents are encouraged to pull their kids out of school Monday to speak out against the “sexualization of our children” in the classroom.

117,1,0.0,"O Ato em Defesa da Democracia, que acontece na noite desta segunda-feira (2) no Circo Voador, Rio de Janeiro (RJ), já é considerado por muitos como “histórico” pelo fato de ter reunido, em um mesmo palco, as mais importantes lideranças da esquerda contemporânea do Brasil, além de nomes da classe artística e da sociedade civil em geral. O mote do ato é a defesa da democracia e a formação de uma frente suprapartidária contra a escalada fascista no país que tem como exemplos a execução da vereadora Marielle Franco (PSOL), os atentados contra a caravana do ex-presidente Lula pelo Sul do Brasil e o evidente crescimento do discurso de ódio nas ruas e nas redes sociais.

Nomes como Manuela D’Ávila (PCdoB), Lula (PT), Marcelo Freixo (PSOL), além de artistas como Chico Buarque ou intelectuais como Marcia Tiburi dividem o mesmo palco. A maior parte dos discursos, até agora, foram em defesa de uma unidade suprapartidária, que envolva a sociedade civil, contra a perseguição judicial ao ex-presidente Lula, os ataques fascistas que vêm vitimando nomes ligados à esquerda e em defesa da democracia que, desde o impeachment da ex-presidenta Dilma Rousseff, de acordo com os participantes, vem sendo ameaçada.

Confira, abaixo, trechos de algumas das principais falas do ato.

“Aquilo que nos une é a luta pela liberdade. Mas hoje, no dia 2 de abril, somos do partido de Tiradentes. E nós também temos uma missão: de dizer que a luta democrática pela liberdade passa pela liberdade de Lula concorrer” – Manuela D’Ávila, pré-candidata à presidência pelo PCdoB

“Aqui estamos começando a erguer os tijolos de uma muralha na luta contra o fascismo. Somos todos camaradas, aprendemos duramente que construir a Frente Única não significa ter adesão de um partido sobre outro. Não podemos mais ter medo das nossas diferenças” – Valerio Arcary, líder do PSOL, que rompeu com o PT há mais de 20 anos

“Conheci muito jovem as prisões da ditadura, sei por dentro o que é o fascismo, e sei que ele tem que ser parado no início, agora, com a unidade popular!” – Carlos Minc, geógrafo, professor, ambientalista, ex-deputado e ex-ministro

“Depois do impeachment da Dilma nada ficou normal em nosso país. É como se tivessem aberto as portas do inferno” – Gleisi Hoffmann, senadora e presidenta nacional do PT

“O assassinato da Marielle foi mais um dos muitos ataques contra a democracia que estamos sofrendo. A morte do corpo da Marielle não é capaz de calar sua voz” – Mônica Tereza Benício, ex-companheira de Marielle Franco

“Estamos vivendo um delírio que é fruto de uma armação histórica que é fruto do neo liberalismo” – Marcia Tiburi, filósofa e escritora

“Sou do Movimento Negro Unificado nós vamos dar uma resposta trazendo a democracia combatendo o fascismo com Lula presidente” – Silvia Mendonça, militante do movimento negro

“Vamos estar unidos para lutar contra o fascismo, racismo, machismo e defender a democracia e a soberania nacional” – Leonardo Giordano, pré-candidato ao governo do Rio de Janeiro pelo PCdoB

“Todos queremos as mesmas coisas, a liberdade, a igualdade, a soberania para defender o pão do povo” – Celso Amorim, ex-ministro e pré-candidato ao governo do Rio de Janeiro pelo PT

119,1,0.0,"April 19 (UPI) -- The U. S. Department of Justice delivered Congress a set of memos written by former FBI Director James Comey, recounting conversations he had with President Donald Trump.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the department decided to provide lawmakers with the memos Thursday due to ""unusual events occurring since the previous limited disclosure,"" CNN reported.

House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes and House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy demanded access to the memos last week as part of their investigation into the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email inquiry in 2016

""The Department has consulted the relevant parties and concluded that the release of the memoranda to Congress at this time would not adversely impact any ongoing investigation or other confidentiality interests of the Executive Branch,"" Boyd wrote in a letter to three committee heads.

Boyd added the Justice Department will provide Congress with two versions of the documents, an unclassified version with sensitive information redacted and a classified unredacted version which will be transmitted to available members of each committee via a secure channel Friday.

The memos are believed to be critical to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trump or his allies attempted to obstruct the FBI's investigation of Trump campaign contacts with Russia.

Comey has said he drafted seven memos detailing his encounters with the president in person and on the phone and has no problem with members of Congress reading their contents.

120,1,0.0,"The annual Coachella music festival always promises a few things for my social media feeds: selfies in front of a ferris wheel, an array of photogenic and overpriced foods, and extravagant pool parties that are somehow always hosted by Shay Mitchell.

This year, thanks to an invitation from SAFE, a sexual-health app that lets you show your verified STD status, I experienced my first Coachella adventure over the course of the first weekend. And it exceeded expectations: accidental sun-kissed naps on the lawn, forgetting to think about what I looked like while I was dancing, the mile-long zombie march through the desert from the designated “entrance” to the actual entrance (bring cash and take a pedicab), and, as one friend described it, “running into people you didn’t even know you knew.” The lineup was incredible, the weather was milder than usual (so I’m told), and of course there was the much-discussed Beychella—which I can confirm was life-changing.

Despite all of that, this year’s Coachella experience was also full of moments I never saw on Instagram: being repeatedly violated by strangers. In the three days I was at Coachella, I only spent a total of 10 hours at the actual festival, where I watched numerous performances and interviewed festivalgoers about their experience with sexual assault and harassment for Teen Vogue. During the 10 hours I was reporting on this story, I was groped 22 times.

One guy followed me across the field to the Mojave stage, where I was meeting a friend to see FIDLAR. When my friend left to see another band, I stayed behind, and this guy came up behind me and whispered, “You’re a goddess” and then rubbed his hands on my hips and butt. I knew it was the guy who followed me over earlier because I recognized his Pablo merch. This is why I usually wear a backpack in concert settings — it forces distance between the stranger behind me and my body.

On Saturday, I was front row at the Outdoor Theatre, leaning against the metal grate to take an epic photo of David Byrne to send to my dad. Someone behind me grabbed my butt with both hands. I didn’t see who it was, and I felt so uncomfortable that I gave up my front row spot and moved to the back of the crowd where I would have more space behind me. I never got the picture.

When I was waiting in line for a sweet potato taco on Sunday, a man poked me in the stomach and asked me if I do Pilates. I said no, and then he asked, “What’s the secret behind that six-pack?” and rubbed my bare stomach with his hand.

Of the 54 young women who spoke to Teen Vogue for this piece during the weekend-long event, all of them had a story of sexual assault or harassment that occurred this year at Coachella. Many of these accounts reveal patterns of predatory behavior harassers exhibited throughout the festival, and many of the reports I collected sound nearly exactly the same. Here are some of their stories, condensed for clarity.

""Of course sexual harassment happens here,” said Ana, 19. “It happens to us at all concerts. At Coachella it is so many people that men will get away with touching you, and they think we don't notice. It happened to me many times already, and I notice every time.”

“It never goes further than a touch on my butt or my back, but it’s not an OK place to be touched,” said June, 20. “Would you do that to a coworker? Or another guy? Then don’t do that to me. This is my third day, and it’s probably happened to me 40 times this weekend.”

“In a really big crowd, you want to have a good time, and you want to dance,” said Phoebe, 20, “It’s just really uncomfortable to feel someone right behind you, touching you or rubbing you. It happened to me a lot at Post Malone.”

Sexual misconduct is unfortunately a common experience at festivals, with one survey finding that more than 90% of female concertgoers have been harassed at a music event. In 2015, a photo of a man wearing a vile “Eat, Sleep, Rape, Repeat” shirt at Coachella went viral, a literal analogy for rape culture, which the Marshall Project describes as ""an environment where rape is prevalent and sexual violence against women is normalized and excused.""

Not only did festivalgoers tell Teen Vogue multiple stories about older men preying on young women, but a festival environment and setup feels like an invitation for men to behave this way, sometimes in groups. Do men see a woman's presence at a music festival, particularly a dancing woman, as a substitute for consent?

“It’s actually happened a handful of times today,"" said Logan, 23. ""If you’re in tight quarters, and you’re getting closer to the stage, guys will always come up and start grinding with you to see if you’re into that sort of thing.”

“As I was walking, a guy grabbed my butt cheek,"" said Anna, 27. ""This is the sort of environment where I think people assume it happens a lot, so you can get away with participating in it.”

“Me and my friends were just dancing yesterday during The Weeknd’s set,” said Aaliyah, 21. “A few guys came over and just poked us and started dancing with us and wouldn’t leave us alone. They kind of swarmed us. Then one was putting his face in our face, seeing if we’d kiss him, but he went down the line.” She continued, “I think they think that since we wear what we want to wear, they are entitled to touch us.”

“There have been a couple of times where I’ve been stopped and a guy has been like, ‘What are you doing? Come to my hotel,’” said Ashley, 21. “They move a little too quick and are really aggressive. When you’re not with your girls, there’s a lot of potential for something dangerous to go down. We literally will not separate, and if we do, it’s in groups, so that way no one is ever alone.”

“Just the way people touch me when you’re walking through a crowd. Why are you touching me there? We’re trying to have fun and fit in here,” said Reagan, 16. “It’s scary, and you can’t trust the random people around you to help you. And with those bigger men, it’s just harder and it's scarier to say something to them because they might get angry and violent. Like if you’re not nice, they might hurt you.”

Reagan’s experience was similar to my experience as well: The night before I had been called a “heinous bitch” by a guy whom I'd declined to kiss on Saturday in the VIP section.

In another instance, I was waiting in line for the bathroom and heard Tyler, the Creator start his set on the main stage behind me. A stranger walked up to me and said that he loved my leopard-print suit. I thanked him, and he proceeded to say he’d love to get in the bathroom stall with me. When I told him not to talk to me like that, he exclaimed, ""Whoa, that's a lot of attitude for a no-name model."" Nobody around me did anything to help.

One of the difficulties of not having proper cell phone service is it can be hard to find your friends (generally the only moments where I felt safe or comfortable throughout the weekend), so that means you have to rely on bystanders.

“I was standing in line for water,” said Chantal, 19. “A guy picked me up and put me over his shoulder. I’m really small, so this happens to me a lot. Sometimes there are really great bystanders. There will be guys who will say, ‘Hey, get away from her,’ and it’s really cool when they do that.”

Incidents of sexual harassment at festivals are not limited to Coachella, of course. In 2014, according to the BBC, two men were arrested for allegedly raping a woman at the Reading Festival in England. In 2016, The Washington Post reported that attendees at Sweden's Bravalla Festival were given bracelets with the reminder: “Don’t grope.” The bracelets were issued in response to several reports of alleged assault at the event. In 2017, the same festival's organizers said they would cancel the following year's event after more than 20 sexual assaults were reported. It had been the largest music festival in Sweden.

In January, Pollstar announced that Coachella continues to be the highest-grossing music festival in the world. In 2017, it grossed a record-setting $114,593,000.

Sexual assault is known to be prevalent at music events, but like most music festivals, Coachella doesn't seem to provide sexual-assault literature for the people attending. When I search the Coachella website for ""sexual assault,"" there are zero results — and that includes the FAQ section. Furthermore, every year ticket buyers receive a wristband box, and according to several attendees, this year's box had a pamphlet about the festival, which contained no information about how to get help if you are sexually assaulted.

There are some groups that have tried to help, like the UK's AIF Safer Spaces campaign, which encourages concertgoers to intervene if they witness harassment taking place. In Chicago, home to Pitchfork and Lollapalooza, among other festivals, a sexual assault awareness campaign called OurMusicOurBody sprang up as a result of a collaboration between local nonprofit organizations Between Friends and Rape Victim Advocates. Some festival organizers are listening. In 2017, Lollapalooza launched a “safety” page addressing its policy on sexual harassment at the festival. Do LaB, a Coachella collaborator, has provided training on sexual assault to fans and staff and provides on-site medical professionals who specialize in sexual assault at the six-day festival Lightning in a Bottle, according to the Los Angeles Times. Despite all of this, the overall culture still has a long way to go. Music festivals are meant to be spaces for people to relax, make new friends, and enjoy music, but the harsh reality is that many people attend with the expectation that they will not be safe in these environments.

Teen Vogue reached out to Coachella for comment and has not received a response.

If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, you can seek help by calling the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (4673). For more resources on sexual assault, visit RAINN, End Rape on Campus, Know Your IX, and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.

His brand of alchemy includes a pinch of macabre, a dash of melancholy and a few handfuls of stunning horror, but then he adds that perfect dollop of whimsy that keeps his audience gripped to the screen as close as Ola Ray clutches to Michael Jackson in the Thriller video.

To watch one of Guillermo’s masterpieces is an experience in escapism and wonder. To gnaw on the totality of his work reveals an obsession with the eternally forbidden romance between beauty and beast. Guillermo is in love with monsters and lives to show us that we are too. With each fable he weaves, he pushes us closer to acceptance of a primal truth: that we each have a deep connection to the spectrum of otherness.

You can develop the ability to orchestrate mythology the way Guillermo does only by being an obsessively empathetic person. He is an auteur whom artists adore. We look up to him because he doesn’t compromise in his mission to burrow down into the craggy pit of love and fear and invite us down there with him.

He later brought the same gritty courage to battling crime at the Department of Justice. Eventually, he retired to private practice, but moved by violence sweeping Washington, D. C., Mueller quit his law firm to work in the trenches as a homicide prosecutor.

When his 10-year term as FBI director expired, a notoriously gridlocked Congress changed the law—just for him—and, once again, Mueller forfeited comfort for continued service.

Mueller is straitlaced and tight-lipped, a legal and sartorial traditionalist. Once, while jointly announcing charges in an international assassination plot, he chided me for wearing a blue shirt.

Mueller’s buttoned-down discretion has made him an enigmatic vessel into which polarized sides pour their hopes and fears. To millions, the special counsel is either a political savior or berserk villain. He is neither. He’s a by-the-book lawman who, with nothing to prove and a lifetime of service behind him, agreed to lead the most fraught, least understood, highest-stakes investigation of our time.

For that we owe him incalculable thanks.

127,1,,"Barbara Pierce Bush, the daughter of former President George W. Bush, will headline a Planned Parenthood fundraiser in North Texas on Wednesday.

She will be the keynote speaker at Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas' annual Fort Worth luncheon, helping to raise money for an organization that provides an array of reproductive and sexual health services, including abortions.

Bush's public appearance before the group is striking, given that her father, President George W. Bush, was a staunch abortion opponent during his time as Texas governor and as president.

But it's not entirely unexpected. Bush's mother, former First Lady Laura Bush, has expressed support for the legality of abortion on a handful of occasions. The younger Bush, the CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps, called Planned Parenthood an ""exceptional organization"" in a June New York Times interview, and attended a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Paris in October.

The lead donor of the luncheon is Sid R. Bass, the prominent Fort Worth billionaire.

Bush's health organization is, according to its website, a nonprofit that ""mobilizes a global community of young leaders to build the movement for health equity."" It partners with organizations overseas to place fellows in year-long tenures promoting world health. Several Planned Parenthood branches are among those organizations.

There's a strong Texas connection in all of this: The president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is Cecile Richards, the daughter of the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards.

Bush's father ousted Richards from the Governor's Mansion in 1994. Many political observers viewed that campaign as — at least in part — revenge for Richards' acerbic 1988 Democratic National Convention keynote speech mocking the GOP nominee. It was Bush's grandfather, George H. W. Bush.

* Texas health officials have delivered a final legal notice to nix the funding Planned Parenthood receives through the Medicaid program.

* In June, the U.S. Supreme Court handed Texas abortion providers a major victory by overturning Texas’ 2013 abortion restrictions.

O ex-presidente Lula e os representantes do PT foram desmentidos por um dos mais profundos estudos sobre a pobreza no Brasil entre os anos de 2010 e 2014. Os indicadores apontam que durante os governos do PT de Lula e Dilma, nada se avançou no combate a desigualdade social no país ao longo de toda a era PT. Os dados foram divulgados nesta terça-feira, 22.

 O Radar IDHM, índice que compara as tendências de crescimento dos indicadores sociais na década de 2000 a 2010 e no período de 2011 a 2014. O estudo comprova que o Brasil perdeu a batalha para redução da desigualdade nos primeiros quatro anos desta década. Estudo feito pelo Programa das Nações Unidas para Desenvolvimento (Pnud) em parceria com o Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (Ipea) e a Fundação João Pinheiro.

A conclusão foi a de que o Brasil não conseguiu, em 14 anos, diminuir o fosso entre ricos e pobres. O estudo comprova que o discurso de Lula e dos integrantes do PT é meramente uma peça de marketing, enquanto os mais pobres continuam a sentir na pele o drama da pobreza e da desigualdade social.

Se comparado a outros países como México, Chile e Colômbia, a conclusão é a de que o povo brasileiro regrediu nas conquistas econômicas e sociais entre o período e que os avanços foram maiores no estudo anterior aos governos do PT.

Outro aspecto que chama a atenção é que o estudo foi realizado durante o período de maior prosperidade dos governos petistas. Os danos na economia causados pela corrupção na Petrobras começaram a ser sentidos justamente após o ano de 2014, o último avaliado na pesquisa. De lá para cá, mais de 12 milhões de brasileiros ficaram sem emprego, o que significa que o fosso que separa os pobres dos ricos aumentou, enquanto a renda das famílias diminuiu ainda mais.

Entre 2000 e 2010, anos dos dois mandatos de Lula, o  Índice de Gini, que mede o nível de desigualdade, aponta que o Brasil teve uma redução da pobreza de 0,6% de 2000 a 2010, mesma proporção identificada para o período de  2011 a 2014. O valor foi considerado inexpressivo pelos especialistas, considerando que mesmo países em guerra tiveram evolução bem maior.

As políticas de transferência de renda e de valorização do salário mínimo alegadas por Lula e Dilma não foram suficientes para mudar de forma significativa a distância dos mais pobres para os mais ricos. As projeções mostram que a desigualdade no Brasil é tão intensa que, mesmo quando a renda do pobre cresce o dobro em relação ao crescimento dos rendimentos dos mais ricos, o impacto na desigualdade ainda não é imediato.

“A desigualdade continua sendo um desafio para o Brasil. A gente consegue aliviar a pobreza, tirar as pessoas da situação de extrema pobreza, mas as pessoas que ganham mais continuam ganhando mais ainda. Então, o fosso da desigualdade continua numa tendência bastante estável”, explica Andréa Bolzon, coordenadora do relatório de Desenvolvimento Humano Nacional do Pnud no Brasil.

O estudo não traz detalhes sobre as causas das mudanças nos indicadores sociais, mas para o Pnud, a desigualdade leva em consideração não somente a diferença de renda, mas também disparidades territoriais, de gênero e raça.

Tanto Radar IDHM como o IDHM são compostos por três indicadores de desenvolvimento humano: longevidade, educação e renda. O índice varia de 0 a 1. Quanto mais próximo de 1, maior o desenvolvimento humano. São cinco classificações: muito baixo, baixo, médio, alto e muito alto.

Outra mentira de Lula e do PT. Autores do trabalho mostraram-se especialmente preocupados com o desempenho na área da educação. ""Esse é o grande gargalo"", constata Andrea. O documento chama a atenção, por exemplo, para a estagnação no porcentual de pessoas com 18 anos ou mais que apresentem ensino fundamental completo. Em 2011, representavam 60,1% do total. Em 2014, eram 61,8%.

De acordo com os estudos, os avanços sociais obtidos pelos mais pobres durante a era PT foram inferiores aos observados no país durante as décadas de 60, 70, 80 e 90. Já para os mais ricos, as administrações petistas foram bastante positivas. Especialmente para os bancos, empreiteiras",,
130,1,0.0,"March flew by, but you shipped some not-to-be-missed releases last month. Here’s a list of the ones that hit our radar—many of them 1.0s!

Congratulations to Fastify, which has reached a milestone 1.0 release. If you couldn’t guess from the name, Fastify is a Node.js web framework with an emphasis on speed. In addition to speed, Fastify has a flexible plugin system and 60 officially-recognized plugins. Version 1.0 solidifies the API and begins a period of long term support, with a commitment to security fixes. Be sure to read the Fastify 1.0 release announcement for more details.

Impress.js is also celebrating a 1.0 release. Have you ever wished you could make a presentation in your text editor instead of fighting with Keynote or PowerPoint? Your wishes can come true with impress.js, a presentation framework that uses HTML and CSS transformations. The 1.0 release marks the introduction of a plugin architecture, Markdown support, and a new lead maintainer. Check out the release announcement and get a taste with these examples.

Did you know? Impress.js has been used to create countless presentations, like this Python workshop from the University of Tehran (source repository) that uses substeps, syntax highlighting, and 3-D space.

OpenPGP.js is an OpenPGP implementation written entirely in JavaScript. The project wants to make it possible “to sign, encrypt, decrypt, and verify any kind of text” without relying on native code. The version 3.0 release includes performance improvements, public-key cryptography using elliptic curves, and some improvements to the library’s internal development (like refactoring to ES6 variable declaration syntax). See the release announcement for more.

Did you know? OpenPGP is an internet standard for encrypted email.

It feels like a bit of an understatement to say that DBeaver is a cross-platform SQL client. They call it the “universal SQL client” and for good reason: it supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, Microsoft Access, and many others. DBeaver’s 5.0 release introduces a (beta) PostgreSQL debugger, niceties like automatic reconnecting, and a load of bug fixes. Check out the release notes for more details.

Legit is another project being welcomed into the version 1.0 club. Legit is described as “Git for Humans.” Inspired by GitHub Desktop, Legit adds shortcuts to the Git command line interface. It simplifies synchronizing with remote repositories, publishing new branches, or undoing commits. Legit 1.0 improves help messages, adds new –fake and –verbose options so you can see what’s happening under the hood, and cleans up some installation and configuration commands. Even Git experts will want to check out these convenient additions.

Did you know? Kenneth Reitz, the creator of Legit, used to be a guest blogger for us back in the day with the GitHub Reflog.

Plyer is an HTML5 video player that can also embed Vimeo and YouTube videos. The release notes call version 3.0 a “massive release” that rewrites most of the video player in ES6. Apart from the substantial rewrite, it adds new features like support for Safari’s picture-in-picture mode, YouTube quality controls, and more.

Did you know? Plyr showcases how open source is being used by companies around the world, from sports magazines to automakers.

Pell makes a bold and convincing claim to be “the simplest and smallest WYSIWYG text editor for web.” At just 3.5 kilobytes minified, it certainly is small and covers all the basic formatting you’d expect from an editor: bold, italic, headings, lists, quotes, and more. Version 1.0 trims some extraneous styles and fixes bugs. Check out the release notes for more information.

MJML is a high-level framework that helps you design responsive emails. Version 4.0 introduces some control over how the Outlook web app renders your messages, customization for the default breakpoints, column gutters, bug fixes, and more. Read the release notes for more info.

Did you know: The MJML community has created a bunch of tools to work with MJML, including an Atom package.

Workbox is a collection of JavaScript libraries for developing Progressive Web Apps that go offline gracefully with service workers. The version 3.0 release of Workbox shrinks the size of the library, kicks off official CDN support, and improves debugging and logging. Take a look at the full release notes though, because there’s a lot more.

Rough.js is a library that helps you use the Canvas API to make shapes that look hand-drawn. It can be used to draw lines, simple geometric shapes, or complex SVG paths. Version 2.0 fixes bugs, improves documentation and examples, and adds support for asynchronous drawing, so complicated shapes don’t block the main thread. Check out the project on GitHub.

Did you know? There’s a Snake clone made with Rough.js for those times you’re feeling nostalgic for your old Nokia feature phone. Play it here or view the source.

That’s just a handful of releases you shipped last month—keep them coming! If you’ve got a release that should be on our radar, send us a note.

Breitbart, the far-right news outlet formerly run by top Trump adviser Steve Bannon, allegedly gave exclusive access to Cambridge Analytica to resell data about what its users were reading. Brittany Kaiser, former director of program development at Cambridge Analytica, gave evidence to a British parliament committee about the arrangement during a hearing Tuesday. In her written statement, Kaiser revealed: “One of Cambridge Analytica’s competitive advantages in the U.

This meant that we had at least some access to what tens of millions of Americans were reading on Breitbart, and could feed this data into our campaign models to help predict resonant issues—and to influence behavior.

Baur said she “was drawn out towards the out of the plane” and “was pulled back in by other passengers,” he said in a phone interview. Shrapnel from the engine broke a window, passengers said. The Boeing 737-800 left New York and was bound for Dallas.

Billionaire GOP Donor: I’m Using My Tax-Cut Money To Help Elect Democrats

""For the good of the country, the Democrats must take back one or both houses of Congress.”

A major GOP donor is jumping ship and now he’s contributing to Democratic candidates in hopes of flipping the House of Representatives and/or the Senate in this year’s midterm elections.

Seth Klarman, the billionaire CEO of the Baupost Group who the Economist once dubbed “The Oracle of Boston,” called out Republicans for failing to keep President Donald Trump in check.

“The Republicans in Congress have failed to hold the president accountable and have abandoned their historic beliefs and values,” Klarman told the Boston Globe. “For the good of the country, the Democrats must take back one or both houses of Congress.”

Klarman, an independent who donated more than $7 million to GOP candidates during the presidency of Barack Obama, has now cut checks to Democrats in 56 House races and 22 Senate elections, the newspaper reported.

“I received a tax cut I neither need nor want. I’m choosing to invest it to fight the administration’s flawed policies and to elect Democrats to the Senate and House of Representatives,” Klarman said.

Klarman also donated $2 million to nonprofits backing core Democratic issues, including gun control and the environment, the Globe reported.

While Klarman contributed far more to Republicans in 2016, he actually backed Hillary Clinton in the presidential race, calling Trump “completely unqualified for the highest office in the land,” according to Reuters.

His views have not changed since the election.

Last year, Klarman described Trump as a “threat to democracy,” per audio obtained by New York magazine. He also warned against Trump’s protectionist agenda in a letter to his investors, saying such policies “not only don’t work, they actually leave society worse off,” The New York Times reported.

In the same letter, he sounded the alarm about the Trump-backed tax cuts that were ultimately enacted by the Republican-led Congress.

“The Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,” Klarman wrote, noting that cuts in 2001 under President George W. Bush “fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits.”

Now, he’s putting his money where his mouth is, donating his own proceeds from those cuts to work against the Republicans who enacted them.

Republicans Who Have Withdrawn Their Support For Donald Trump

""Donald Trump&rsquo;s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy,"" McCain said in a statement.
",1,1938,Billionaire GOP Donor: I’m Using My Tax-Cut Money To Help Elect Democrats,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seth-klarman-democratic-donor_us_5ad4322fe4b077c89cea0063?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004,,
134,1,,"As congressional Republicans fight to preserve their majorities, they may need to find a weapon more powerful than the big December tax cuts.

The new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows that the tax-cut law, never broadly popular, has sagged in public esteem lately. Just 27 percent of Americans call it a good idea, down from 30 percent in January. A 36 percent plurality call it a bad idea, while the rest have no opinion.

Moreover, a majority gives thumbs-down on the plan when asked to consider its potential effects. Just 39 percent foresee a positive impact from a stronger economy, more jobs and more money in their pockets; 53 percent foresee a negative impact from higher deficits and disproportionate benefits for the wealthy and big corporations.

""Not a great starting point"" for the fall campaign, said Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster who conducted the survey with Republican counterpart Bill McInturff. The telephone poll of 900 adults, conducted April 8-11, carries a margin of error of 3.27 percentage points.

Republicans began learning that lesson last month during a special House election in Pennsylvania. GOP strategists found the tax cuts an ineffective message against the Democratic candidates and dropped the issue as Election Day approached.

The Democratic victory in a district President Donald Trump had won by 20 percentage points in 2016 showed that tax cuts are ""a political loser,"" says David Wasserman, a House analyst at the Cook Political Report.

The question now is how much effort GOP candidates sink into improving their stance on the tax-cut issue. They retain some advantages: Men still favor the tax cuts, although less strongly than women oppose it; so do rural residents, older men, and men without college degrees.

Yet working-class, middle-class and upper-class Americans all hold negative views of the tax-cut law. Women who have graduated from college call the tax cuts a bad idea by nearly a 3-to-1 margin.

Overall, the NBC/WSJ Poll shows Democrats with a seven-point edge over Republicans, 47 percent to 40 percent, on which party Americans want to win control of Congress this fall. Just 39 percent of Americans approve of Trump's job performance, while 57 percent disapprove.

Rajoy confunde al primer ministro danés con el chófer del primer ministro danés                                                            AMBOS HABLARON DE MOVILIDAD DURANTE MÁS DE UNA HORA

El presidente del Gobierno, Mariano Rajoy, debía reunirse el pasado viernes con el primer ministro de Dinamarca, Lokke Rasmussen, para hablar del futuro de Europa y la salida del Reino Unido del proyecto europeo. Aunque el mandatario español tildó la reunión de “interesante y provechosa”, un comunicado del ejecutivo danés ha confirmado que Rajoy no habló con Rasmussen sino con el chófer de éste, Mogens Albertsen.

“Estuve esperando al señor Rajoy más de una hora, luego decidí marcharme pero no localicé a mi conductor. Aparecieron ambos al cabo de media hora, charlando tranquilamente”, confirma el primer ministro danés.

“Hemos hablado principalmente de movilidad, que es un tema fundamental en la Europa de hoy en día”, dijo Rajoy a los medios el viernes por la tarde. “Facilitar que los europeos se desplacen libremente, sin cortapisas, debe ser un objetivo común de todos los miembros de la Unión, y el señor Rasmussen lo comparte conmigo y de hecho me comentó que la movilidad y la libre circulación de las personas son su cometido principal”, explicó.

Varios periodistas españoles señalaron que la persona con la que Rajoy había estado hablando no era el mandatario danés, pero la naturalidad con la que ambos posaron ante las cámaras se impuso, y ha habido que esperar al comunicado oficial del gobierno de Dinamarca para desvelar el malentendido. Pese a ello, Rajoy no le ha dado importancia a la confusión: “Se habló de lo que se tenía que hablar y, como comprenderán, el señor Albertsen se encargará de compartirlo todo con Rasmussen, así que todo fue bien y ahora en lo que hay que pensar es en el próximo Marco Financiero Plurianual”.

137,1,0.0,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on the Pulitzer Prizes (all times local):

An Alabama columnist and the Washington Post won a Pulitzer for stories uncovering the past of Republican Roy Moore during Alabama's U. S. Senate campaign last year.

John Archibald of the Alabama Media Group was awarded journalism's highest honor for commentary on Monday.

Archibald was recognized for his ""lyrical and courageous commentary"" and the Post won for investigative reporting for stories revealing allegations that Moore pursued teenage girls sexually decades ago while he was in his 30s in Gadsden.

The stories upended a race that ended with Doug Jones being the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Alabama in decades.

Moore's wife, Kayla, posted on Facebook Monday that journalism that becomes a political tool to assassinate someone's character isn't worthy of any prize.

A photographer in Charlottesville, Virginia, has won a Pulitzer for capturing the moment a car struck several people protesting against a white nationalist rally.

Ryan Kelly captured the photo on his last day of worked for The Daily Progress last August.

One woman, Heather Heyer, died and 19 people were injured.

Pulitzer Prize Administrator Dana Canedy said during Monday's announcement that Kelly captured a ""chilling image that reflected the photographer's reflexes and concentration.""

Kelly says he is ""shocked and amazed."" He described the prize as an ""incredible honor"" and said he was proud of the work ""we all did at The Daily Progress.""

But he says he's still heartbroken for Heyer's family and everybody else who was affected by the tragic violence.

A Cincinnati newspaper's weeklong examination of the many ways the heroin crisis is impacting its community has won the Pulitzer for local reporting.

Cheers, hugs and champagne toasts swept the Cincinnati Enquirer newsroom Monday after the announcements of journalism's most prestigious prizes at Columbia University in New York.

The Enquirer won for ""Seven Days of Heroin,"" which combined more than 60 journalists to tell stories through the eyes of families, first responders, courtroom officials and other viewpoints.

Executive Editor Beryl Love calls the ambitious project ""a huge accomplishment"" that explained thoroughly heroin's impact and showed ""this is why journalism matters."" He succeeded Peter Bhatia as editor in January.

Andrew Sean Greer's ""Less"" has won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.

Greer's novel tells the comic story of a middle-aged novelist. The awards were given out Monday at an announcement at New York's Columbia University.

The drama prize went to Martyna Majok for ""Cost of Living,"" Carolyn Fraser's work on author Laura Ingalls Wilder, ""Prairie Fires,"" won for biography.

James Forman Jr's ""Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America"" won for general nonfiction, and Jack E. Davis' The Gulf"" for history.

Rapper Kendrick Lamar's ""DAMN."" has won the Pulitzer Prize for music. It's the first non-classical or jazz work to win the award.

The Pulitzer board on Monday called the album a work that captures the complexity of African-American life.

Lamar has been praised and lauded for his deep lyrical content, remarkable live performances, and his profound mix of hip-hop, spoken word, jazz, soul, funk, poetry and African sounds.

His major-label albums ""good kid, m. A.A.d city,"" ''To Pimp a Butterfly"" and ""DAMN."" became works of art, with Lamar writing songs about blackness, street life, police brutality, perseverance, survival and self-worth.

His piercing raps helped him become the voice of the generation, and easily ascend as the leader in hip-hop and cross over to audiences outside of rap, from rock to pop to jazz.

The New York Times and The Washington Post have won the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting for illuminating the ongoing investigation into possible contacts between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russian officials.

American journalism's most prestigious awards were announced Monday at Columbia University.

A string of stories in the two newspapers shined light on connections between Russian officials and Trump's 2016 campaign. The ties fueled Special Counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing probe into alleged Russian attempts to influence the presidential election.

The New York Times and the New Yorker won the public service prize for sexual misconduct reporting that galvanized the #MeToo movement.

The Press Democrat of Santa Rosa, California, won the breaking news award for coverage of the wildfires that swept through California's wine country last fall.

The New York Times and The New Yorker have won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for their reporting on Harvey Weinstein and sexual misconduct that galvanized the #MeToo movement.

American journalism's most prestigious awards are being announced Monday at Columbia University.

In stories that appeared within days of each other in October, The Times and The New Yorker reported that Weinstein had faced allegations of sexual harassment and assault from multiple women in Hollywood going back decades. The movie producer's attorneys have said he denies any non-consensual sexual contact with anyone.

The stories' impact soon spread beyond Weinstein to allegations against other prominent men. And the #MeToo hashtag quickly became rallying cry for people to speak out about their own experiences of sexual harassment and assault.

The winners of the Pulitzer Prizes in journalism and the arts are set to be announced in New York City.

The winners are being revealed Monday afternoon at Columbia University.

The Pulitzer Prizes recognize the best journalism of 2017 in newspapers, magazines and websites. There are 14 categories for reporting, photography, criticism and commentary.

In the arts, prizes are awarded in seven categories, including fiction, drama and music.

The first journalism prizes were awarded in 1917, including one to the New York Tribune for an editorial on the first anniversary of the sinking of the Lusitania. That year, two daughters of abolitionist Julia Ward Howe won for a biography of their mother — at a time when women couldn't vote and the literary world was dominated by men.

138,1,0.0,"WASHINGTON – When James Comey was fired by President Trump last year, the former FBI director quickly assumed the mantle of chief prosecution witness for Russia special counsel Robert Mueller.

His written record of several troubling encounters with Trump while FBI director — including the president's requests for loyalty and for the FBI to drop its investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn — are at the heart of Mueller's investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct the continuing examination of Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

The witness, however, is now an author.

And his explosive book, in which Comey compares Trump with the Mafia bosses he once prosecuted, not only represents a new crisis for a reeling White House but also is raising questions about the former director's credibility as a critical witness against the president.

""The book amounts to a new 300-page witness statement, and if it differs at all from what he provided the special counsel, you can be sure that there will be a challenge if this case moves to an impeachment or a trial,"" said Jack Sharman, a former special counsel in the Whitewater investigation involving then-president Clinton. ""This will be, at least, a pain (for Mueller) to deal with.""

In his own words: 8 key quotes from James Comey on Donald Trump and what's next

James Comey: Lessons he learned from the tragic loss of his infant son

The Republican National Committee already has launched an offensive against the book, challenging the former director's credibility with a feature on its website titled ""Lyin Comey."" The site includes critical tweets from Trump and comments from lawmakers questioning Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of private email server.

Aside from the book's scathing content, former FBI assistant director Ron Hosko said the publication likely opens the door to criticism that Comey penned the dramatic account merely to enrich himself.

""You can see that coming,"" said Hosko, who worked for the former director and has supported him. ""You can almost hear the defense lawyer saying, 'This witness has a motive to sell books.' ""

In an interview with USA TODAY, Comey characterized the book project as ""an obligation to try to drive a healthy conversation"" about leadership and ethics.

""I learned from my wife long ago that when something bad happens, you should try to make something good come from it,"" Comey said, referring to the loss of a young son to a preventable infection. ""This is nowhere near that. ... I was fired from a job that I loved in a place that I loved working. And the good I hope to come out of it is for me to offer a vision to people, especially young people, about what ethical leadership is.""

In the book, A Higher Loyalty:Truth Lies and Leadership, he also defended the timing of the book's publication in the midst of the ongoing Russia inquiry and before the release of a Justice Department inspector general's examination into the FBI's handling of the Clinton email investigation, which Comey oversaw.

Comey told USA TODAY that he did not consult Mueller about the timing of the book's publication.

""It is wrong to stand idly by, or worse, to stay silent when you know better, while a president brazenly seeks to undermine public confidence in law enforcement institutions that were established to keep our leaders in check,"" Comey wrote.

Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor, said that while there is less risk in limiting a witness' public statement about an ongoing case, Comey's story already has been the subject of a full, public Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.

""Unless there are glaring inconsistencies in his testimony and what he told the special counsel and in his book, I don't see a problem,"" Cotter said. ""It appears to me that what I know about the book is that he is sharing his inner monologue about his interactions with the president that he already has testified about. He's not changing the facts.""

Cotter said any argument related to a financial incentive also could fall flat. ""As far as I know, everybody does what they do for money. I thought the Republicans were in favor of capitalism.

""In a perfect world you would put witnesses in a cryogenic chamber and only let them out when it's time to testify,"" Cotter said. ""That's not the world we live in.""

He had no idea Ruth Bader Ginsburg would be presiding over his naturalization ceremony

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg speaks during the 2018 Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 21 in Park City, Utah. (Robin Marchant/Getty Images)  The invitation to Dante Amaury Perez-Valdez’s naturalization ceremony indicated that it would be a “special” one. But he and his American-born wife, Natalie, assumed the government said that about all of the ceremonies. For Perez-Valdez, the day was already special enough: Eight years after marrying Natalie in the Dominican Republic, obtaining his green card and then learning English and studying well over a year for the citizenship test, he had become a new American. He would never have to worry again about one day being separated from his wife and baby for lack of papers. “This was a big day for me and also for my family,” said Perez-Valdez, who became a chef at Eataly in New York City after starting on the prep team when he arrived in the country. “It was a long way for us.” The day got even bigger when Perez-Valdez saw U. S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg take a seat on the stage, her tiny frame swallowed up by the wooden chair. Nobody, he said, including the new citizens seated around him, knew she was coming. “My fellow Americans,” she began, “it is my great privilege to welcome you to citizenship in the democracy that is the USA.” Administering the oath of citizenship to the 201 new Americans gathered at the New-York Historical Society Tuesday was Ginsburg’s idea. She read an article in the New York Times about how the historical society had been helping green-card holders prepare for the citizenship test and decided to reach out and tell the staff that, “if ever I am in town when they had a naturalization ceremony, I would be glad to participate,” she told the Times in a statement. On Tuesday, she told of her family’s humble beginnings, how her father “arrived in this land at the age of 13 with no fortune and speaking no English” — the part that Perez-Valdez said he related to most. Her mother was born shortly after Ginsburg’s grandparents came through Ellis Island by ship, she said. She was born in Brooklyn in 1933. “My father and grandparents reached as you do for the American Dream,” she said. “As testament to our nation’s promise, the daughter and granddaughter of these immigrants sits on the highest court to the land, and will proudly administer the oath of citizenship to you.”

Perez-Valdez and his wife, Natalie, after the naturalization ceremony. (Courtesy of Natalie Ferrell)  Throughout her speech, 85-year-old Ginsburg emphasized the country’s constant state of change. Detailing the lowest points, from slavery and denying women the vote, she quoted Alexis de Tocqueville: “The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than other nations but rather in her ability to repair her faults.” At the start, it is true, the union was very much in need of perfection,” she said. “The original Constitution permitted slavery and severely limited who counted among the people. When the nation was new, only white property-owning men had the right to vote, the most basic right of citizenship. But over the course of our history, people left out at the start, people held in human bondage, Native Americans and women — 50 percent of the population — came to be embraced as full citizens.” Before administering the oath to the room full of immigrants from nearly every continent — from Albania, Guinea, Serbia, Venezuela — she encouraged the citizens to take advantage of their newly granted rights: namely, the right to vote. Perez-Valdez said he already plans to register for the midterm elections this November. “It was very special to hear from her today,” Perez-Valdez said. “She told us that if we’re working hard, we can do anything.” After the ceremony, he headed back to Eataly, where he worked the closing shift.  Texas’s maternal mortality rate was unbelievably high.

144,1,0.0,"On the surface, the Facebook page had all the markings of an authentic Black Lives Matter group.

Its profile picture — “BLACK LIVES MATTER” in block text against a bright yellow background — echoed the style and colors of the one used on Blacklivesmatter.com.

The “Black Lives Matter”-emblazoned merchandise sold through the Facebook page all benefited related causes.

And it had nearly 700,000 followers, making it the largest Facebook page affiliated with the movement.

As it turns out, the page was apparently a fraud, tied to an Australian man who had also registered dozens of other domain names related to black civil rights causes, according to a CNN investigation. And it remained in operation for more than a year, despite multiple efforts to warn Facebook that the page might be fraudulent.

The alleged “Black Lives Matter” Facebook page also brought in at least $100,000 in donations through third-party online fundraisers such as PayPal and Patreon, CNN reported. But the network’s investigation found some of that money was deposited into Australian bank accounts, and that at least one online fundraising account was linked to Ian Mackay, an official with the National Union of Workers, an Australian trade union.

When contacted by CNN, Mackay, who is white, denied he administered the page. He also brushed off questions about several other websites — with names such as blackpowerfist.com and blacklivesmatter.media — that were registered to him, and which the “Black Lives Matter” Facebook page had occasionally promoted.

“I once bought the domain name only and sold it,” Mackay told CNN, referring to one such website that had been registered to him. “My domain name buying and selling is a personal hobby.”

As of Tuesday, however, the page apparently has been taken down. Online fundraisers previously associated with the page have also been disabled, and third-party payment companies such as Classy, Donorbox, PayPal and Patreon all told CNN they had cut ties with the page.

Mackay resigned from his job Tuesday at the National Union of Workers, according to the Guardian. The trade union said in a statement that it was investigating Mackay’s alleged association with the fraudulent Facebook page.

“The NUW is not involved in and has not authorized any activities with reference to claims made in CNN’s story,” the union told the newspaper.

CNN’s report came as Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg prepared to testify before Congress about the social media platform’s role in spreading fake news and its responsibility to protect its users’ data from third-party apps, particularly after the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.

According to prepared remarks, Zuckerberg planned to acknowledge Facebook’s dark side Tuesday as he addressed lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“It’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well,” Zuckerberg’s prepared remarks stated. “That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy. We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.”

[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Capitol Hill: ‘It was my mistake, and I’m sorry.’]

Zuckerberg’s apologetic tone and vow to change, however, were not reflected in Facebook’s response to the fake “Black Lives Matter” page, according to CNN and others who had tried to warn the social media platform earlier about the possible scam.

One of the founders of the real Black Lives Matter Facebook page, which has a blue verified check mark and about 300,000 followers, said the organization contacted Facebook months ago to report concerns that the page with the larger following was fraudulent, to no avail. And last December, a blogger named Jeremy Massler called out the fake “Black Lives Matter” page as “probably a sham” and drew connections between it and Mackay.

Massler dubbed the fake page “BlackLivesMatter1″ after its user name.

“BlackLivesMatter1 doesn’t try to organize rallies or affect politics. Instead, their mission is to expose racism, and they accomplish that by sharing stories on social media. In theory, it’s an admirable goal, but parts of the presentation made me suspicious,” Massler wrote. “My hunch is that whoever currently runs BlackLivesMatter1 is trying to make some money off the back of the Black Lives Matter movement. Still, I’m surprised the page has flown under the media’s radar when you consider the current political climate.”

[Facebook wants its users to drive out fake news. Here’s the problem with that.]

The Facebook page went down briefly after Massler reported on it, according to CNN.

In Brian Stelter’s media newsletter “Reliable Sources” on Tuesday,” CNN reporter Donie O’Sullivan explained that CNN presented its findings about the fake “Black Lives Matter” page to Facebook last week, but the company initially dismissed concerns by saying the page did not violate its “community standards.” Facebook also did not divulge whether more traffic had been driven to the bogus page through Facebook ads.

On Monday, however, Facebook confirmed that the page has been taken down.

“Not for the first time, Facebook took action against a major bad actor on its site not on its own but because journalists made inquiries,” O’Sullivan told Stelter. “The discovery raises a lot of Q’s about how Facebook polices its platform — if it can’t figure out there is something up with the biggest ‘BLM’ account, with almost 700,000 followers, why should we trust it to find other fakes?”

Black Lives Matter did not immediately respond to questions sent by email Tuesday morning.

145,4,1.0,"SÃO PAULO. Os ex-governadores tucanos Geraldo Alckmin (SP), Beto Richa (PR) e Marconi Perillo (GO), e Confúcio Moura (MDB-RO) e Raimundo Colombo (PSD–SC), que perderam a prerrogativa de foro privilegiado, dificilmente devem ser julgados até o fim do ano. Todos eles renunciaram à chefia do Executivo de seus Estados para concorrer às próximas eleições – Alckmin, por exemplo, vai disputar a corrida pela Presidência.

Claudia Vara, advogada criminalista do San Juan Araújo Advogados, diz que “a consequência imediata da perda do foro privilegiado é a remessa dos inquéritos e processos em trâmite no Superior Tribunal de Justiça para a primeira instância, que é competente para apuração dos fatos”.

Segundo ela, a primeira instância passa a apreciar todas as questões relativas ao caso. “Altera-se também a forma de recebimento de eventuais denúncias. Quando há foro privilegiado, denúncias oferecidas contra governadores pelo Ministério Público são recebidas pelo colegiado do STJ, após a apresentação de defesa escrita. Com a perda do foro, a denúncia é recebida pelo juízo singular, que já determina, de acordo com a pauta, a designação de audiência, o que acaba por tornar o processo mais célere”, compara.

Unidade. As investigações sobre os ex-governadores estavam sob responsabilidade do STJ, que deve decidir para qual unidade judicial os processos migrarão. No caso de Alckmin, os autos se deslocarão para a Justiça Eleitoral.

A advogada Sylvia Urquiza, sócia do Urquiza, Pimentel e Fonti Advogados, diz que, se houver outros investigados com foro privilegiado, o STJ pode entender que é melhor que os ex-governadores continuem sendo investigados no mesmo inquérito. “Por outro lado, podem também desmembrar o caso”, analisa Sylvia. “Nessa hipótese, os ex-governadores passariam a ser investigados em primeira instância”, afirma.

Segundo a advogada Anna Julia Menezes, do escritório Braga Nascimento e Zílio, quando existem outros réus ainda com foro privilegiado no processo, há relatores que entendem que o caso deva permanecer no STJ. “Como o Judiciário não quer que fique esse pingue-pongue de instâncias, algumas autoridades pensam que é melhor tudo ficar em um mesmo lugar”, declara Anna.

Além disso, deve haver uma outra relação de projetos a serem concedidos ou privatizados no médio prazo, com leilões que podem ocorrer em até um ano, como das distribuidoras de energia da Eletrobras e dos mananciais de água doce.

A relevância de um dos maiores mananciais mundial de água doce é tamanha que, há décadas, tem sido alvo da especulação quanto ao seu uso e exploração. O Projeto de Proteção Ambiental e Desenvolvimento Sustentável do Sistema Aquífero Guarani, conhecido por Projeto Aquífero Guarani (SAG), da ANA, foi criado com o propósito de apoiar Argentina, Brasil, Paraguai e Uruguai na elaboração e implementação de um marco legal e técnico de gerenciamento e preservação do Aquífero Guarani para as gerações presentes e futuras. Após a vitória dos conservadores na Argentina e os golpes de Estado por orientação da ultradireita, tanto no Paraguai quanto no Brasil, restou ao Uruguai votar contra a privatização do aquífero.

Esse projeto foi executado com recursos do Global Environment Facility (GEF), sendo o Banco Mundial a agência implementadora e a Organização dos Estados Americanos (OEA) a agência executora internacional. A GEF, no entanto, mantém laços muito próximos às grandes corporações.

147,4,1.0,"Today was a productive vocabulary day in the United States of America.

The learning began in the morning, when former CIA director John O. Brennan tweeted at President Trump: “Your kakistocracy is collapsing after its lamentable journey.”

The insult was part of a raging feud between Trump and various members of the intelligence community, some of whom suspect the president’s inner circle of committing federal crimes, and many of whom Trump says are out to destroy him.

Brennan’s tweet proved quite popular with Trump’s critics, even if not everyone totally understood it.

What, wondered the actor/director Zach Braff and the fake congressman Steven Smith, and many others, was a “kakistocracy”?

Kleptocracy means a government by thieves, and autocracy means government by one person. Both of those terms have been used liberally by Trump’s critics in the last year or so, but kakistocracy … was that like a government of cack, as in dung?

Searches for the kakistocracy surged to the top of Merriam-Webster, arguably the hippest of the major dictionaries, which recently made “dumpster fire” an official English word.

So Merriam-Webster wrote a short explainer. Kakistos is Greek for “worst,” so kakistocracy means government by the worst people.

The plural is kakistocracies, the dictionary added, in case the world one day ends up with two of them.

Merriam-Webster traced the word’s first known use to a 159-word sentence in a sermon by a supporter of King Charles I during the English Civil War in 1644.

It’s too amazing to excerpt, so buckle in:

“We need not make any scruple of praying against such,” the speaker Paul Gosnold said of the king’s enemies, “against those Sanctimonious Incendiaries, who have fetched fire from heaven to set their Country in combustion, have pretended Religion to raise and maintain a most wicked rebellion, against those Neros, who have ripped up the womb of the mother that bare them, and wounded the breasts that gave them suck, against those cannibals who feed upon the flesh and are drunk with the blood of their own brethren, against those Catilines who seek their private ends in the public disturbance, and have set the kingdom on fire to roast their own eggs, against those tempests of the State, those restless spirits who can no longer live, then be stickling and meddling, who are stung with a perpetual itch of changing and innovating, transforming our old hierarchy into a new Presbytery, and this again into a newer Independency; and our well-tempered Monarchy into a mad kind of Kakistocracy.

“Good Lord!” he continued (sorry, we don’t want to break up his rhythm). “What wild irregular courses have these men run, since the reins have lain loose upon them? I am afraid, they will never leave chopping and changing, plotting and practicing, till in conclusion they bring all to confusion, all to an Anarchy or savage Ataxie, Prayer, Peace, Jerusalem, and all.”

Gosnold’s side eventually lost the war. Anyway, Brennan wasn’t the first person to use the word after him. It appeared in the epigraph of a 1992 book about Dan Quayle, and then the name of a Tennessee punk band.

Paul Krugman rolled the word out in the New York Times near the beginning of Trump’s presidency: “An American kakistocracy — rule by the worst.”

This isn’t even the first time it’s surged on Merriam-Webster. The dictionary had to explain the word last summer, too, after MSNBC host Joy Reid used it, once again, to drag Trump.

This time, however, kakistocracy blew up the charts, with dictionary searches spiking nearly 14,000 percent after Brennan’s tweet.

The second most popular word of the day was “slimeball,” which had been Trump’s verbiage in the tweet to which Brennan was replying.

This article originally stated incorrectly that Gosnold was addressing British Parliament. His sermon is labeled as such, but he was actually addressing the king’s loyalists in Oxford, who called themselves Parliament even though they were at war with the actual Parliamentarians who went on to win the English Civil War.

‘Feminism’ is Merriam-Webster’s word of the year, thanks in part to Kellyanne Conway

Congratulations, everybody: ‘Dumpster fire’ is now a dictionary entry, and here’s why

""Faccio un appello: smettetela con gli insulti a vicenda, con le ripicche, i veti, i bisticci, le polemiche. Così non se ne esce. Se ciascuno fa un passo a lato, si costruisce, si lavora"". Lo dice Matteo Salvini, leader della Lega, parlando della formazione del governo in una diretta Faceboook. La crisi siriana ""porta un'accelerazione sulla formazione del nuovo governo. C'è una vita reale che dice 'fate in fretta'. Basta, io sono ai limiti della pazienza, o si va avanti e si lavora o tanto vale tornare dagli italiani con un voto chiaro a dire 'facciam da soli'. Basta dire: 'se ci sono io, non c'è lui'"".

""Qualcuno, come Pd e Forza Italia, sogna i governoni con tutti, alla Monti, Pd, Forza Italia. Gli italiani hanno chiesto qualcosa di diverso. Voi molisani e friulani potete scegliere la Lega e darmi così una mano a far capire che aria tira"", afferma Salvini. ""Mi rifiuto di pensare - ribadisce - a un governo che coinvolga il Pd, che in questi anni ha fatto il contrario di quello che voglio fare io ed è stato bocciato dagli italiani. Continuo a mantenere un atteggiamento zen, sereno, costruttivo, pacifico e di buon senso. Non capisco le polemiche e gli insulti. Non capisco di Battista e non capisco Berlusconi: si mettono sullo stesso piano"". ""Fino a che qualcuno, come il mio alleato Berlusconi o Di Battista, usa l'insulto, fino a che continuano i capricci i veti e i protagonisti non se ne esce. Il centrodestra ha il dovere di governare e ascoltare e coinvolgere i secondi arrivati che sono i Cinque stelle"". Lo dice Matteo Salvini, leader della Lega, in una diretta su Facebook. ""Non ritengo che ci siano eletti o elettori pericolosi: quando qualcuno parla di un voto sbagliato è irriconoscente verso la democrazia, chi prende i voti è legittimato"", aggiunge.

Berlusconi: M5s un pericolo, io so fermare escalation - ""Questo movimento ha raggiunto il 33% in Italia e nel Molise, ha superato il 50%. Sono un nuovo pericolo per il nostro paese. Questo vecchietto, vedendo un grave pericolo per il suo paese e ricordando le parole della madre, ha trovato il coraggio di scendere di nuovo in campo per combattere questo pericolo"". Così Silvio Berlusconi durante il suo intervento all' Auditorium di Isernia, in riferimento al Movimento 5 Stelle che non ha mai citato per intero. ""Daremo - ha aggiunto il leader di Forza Italia - un lavoro a quei giovani in difficoltà, senza passare per la tragedia di un Governo di questo movimento, sono l'unico protagonista di questo centrodestra in grado di fermare questa escalation"".

""Clearly, the Assad regime did not get the message last year,"" Mattis said. ""This time, our allies and we have struck harder. Together, we have sent a clear message to Assad, and his murderous lieutenants, that they should not perpetrate another chemical weapons attack for which they will be held accountable.""

163,1,,"Donald Trump is not on the cover of Time this week, and that must gall him. The president is the subject of the magazine’s cover story, the promise of which apparently persuaded him to grant it an exclusive interview. But instead of Trump’s visage, the cover features a single three-word question in bold red type: “Is Truth Dead?”

It’s a callback to Time’s famous 1966 cover—“Is God Dead?”—and as such, it’s an eye-catcher. Time isn’t what it once was, but it still has a prominent perch on newsstands across the country. And this week, its top story highlights a side of Trump that much of the mainstream media have until recently failed, or neglected, to properly convey: his fundamental dishonesty.

The question on the magazine’s cover refers to Trump’s apparent ability to lie, dissemble, and distract from the truth—and to not only get away with it but to ride those lies to the world’s most powerful office. The story within by Time’s Washington bureau chief, Michael Scherer, rightly takes Trump’s dishonesty as its premise, then asks: How exactly does it work, and why, and can it possibly keep working now that he’s president? It’s a good story, thoughtful and—though Trump would never admit it—fair in the sense that it examines its subject’s penchant for prevarication without exaggerating, distorting, or moralizing.

More revealing still is the full interview transcript, which finds Trump inadvertently proving the story’s premise at every turn. The money quote, which is also the cover story’s kicker, is Trump in microcosm. Caught in a contradiction over his wiretapping claims, the president throws up one red herring after another, like a panicked homeowner hurling kitchen appliances at an intruder, before resorting finally to this: “Hey look … I can’t be doing so badly, because I’m president, and you’re not.”

Time is not the only mainstream publication to belatedly shine its light full-blast on Trump’s mendacity. The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial board got there this week, too, making Trump’s credibility the subject of a scathing column that likened the president to a drunk clinging to a gin bottle. The implication: He’s addicted to lying.

Even Fox News has begun to set boundaries around the degree of pro-Trump dishonesty it will tolerate: This week it suspended one of its top legal commentators over false claims about wiretapping, which the White House had subsequently latched onto.

On a superficial level, it’s remarkable that middle-of-the-road and even conservative journalistic outlets are now breaking with their own conventions to, essentially, label the president of the United States an inveterate liar. But on a deeper level, what’s remarkable is that it took them this long.

That Trump is a professional peddler of smears and conspiracies has been clear from the outset. After all, we’re talking about a man who built his political name around the nakedly racist and utterly false claim that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya. And yet he ran a whole campaign, was elected president, and spent more than two months spouting whoppers from the White House before some of the nation’s largest media outlets began to call him for what he is. And he did it all while branding his opponent as “crooked Hillary,” a ploy by which he manipulated much of the media and the public into minimizing his own misdeeds by mentioning hers in the same breath. (To be fair, some major news organizations, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times, have been duly documenting and highlighting Trump’s dishonesty since long before he was elected. That they’ve often been reticent to apply the “L-word” speaks not so much to cowardice as to the high bar they’ve set for deploying such a freighted term. Hearteningly, these publications have become much better about not letting Trump’s false claims stand unchallenged, even in headlines.)

It isn’t that Time, the Wall Street Journal, and others haven’t confronted Trump on specific claims. They have, of course. But they’ve failed until now to recognize that his untruths amount to something much more than a series of claims to be evaluated and debunked just as the claims of any politician must be. Trump’s reliance on dishonesty is not incidental to his character, or his appeal, or his approach to politics. It is his defining feature, shaping everything from how he talks, to the views he holds, to the way he conducts business and politics. If that sounds like an exaggeration, just go read the Time interview again and chase it with the Washington Post’s fact-check.

Trump’s lies are, and have long deserved to be, a top story in their own right. That the mainstream media have largely failed to treat them as such reveals the depth of its entrenched conventions around journalistic balance and respect for the presidency. Too many reporters and editors allow those conventions to constrain what should always be their core mission, which is to tell the public what they know to be true, no matter whom it offends or embarrasses.

The focus on Trump’s credibility may be late in coming, but it’s welcome nonetheless. In a way, Time—and the Wall Street Journal, and even in its way Fox News—has helped to answer that cover story’s three-word question through its own actions this week. So have the members of the public who have recently withdrawn their support of Trump, plunging his approval rating to historic lows. The truth isn’t dead: It’s down, and Trump is kicking it. But this week, at last, it’s kicking back.

164,1,0.0,"Those same sources spoke to Rosenstein multiple times over the course of his tenure as the No. 2 attorney at the Justice Department and say Rosenstein now seems less anxious than he has been at previous times when the president has criticized him.

They previously described Rosenstein as anxious and upset under the pressure of public criticism for his role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey as well as the president's wrath for his subsequent decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Particularly in early summer 2017, around the time he fired Comey, and towards the end of the year as Trump increased his public denunciations of Rosenstein, sources say they witnessed the deputy attorney general's anxiety flare, sometimes in late-night phone calls.

Rosenstein, who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents as a U. S. attorney, took over the Russia probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in March 2017 after reports surfaced about Sessions' interactions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sessions said he recused himself in order to avoid the appearance of conflict since he worked as a campaign surrogate, but that the meetings were within the scope of his duties as a U.S. senator at the time.

If Rosenstein is fired, the next in line to oversee Mueller's probe is Solicitor General Noel Francisco, though Trump could choose to replace Rosenstein with anyone who has been confirmed by the Senate.

Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning that Rosenstein was perhaps more conflicted than Mueller because he ""signed FISA and Comey letter,"" referring to the authorization for surveillance of former Trump campaign operative Carter Page as well as the memo that fired James Comey.

Alan Dershowitz, a criminal defense lawyer who has publically defended Donald Trump against the Mueller probe, said Rosenstein should be recused from overseeing the Russia investigation because he is a witness to issues under investigation, such as the firing of Comey. Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has also called on Trump to fire Rosenstein this week.

The Justice Department and Rosenstein declined to comment on the content of these private conversations.

The level of concern about Rosenstein's fate is so significant that, within the past 24 hours, a group of more than 100 former Department of Justice career officials organized a statement telling Congress to be ready to take action.

The officials, who've served under both Republicans and Democrats, include former U. S. attorneys John McKay of Washington and Kevin Techau of Iowa.

""Many of us served with Robert Mueller and Rod Rosenstein,"" says the statement, obtained by NBC News.

""We know the people who serve at the Department will bravely weather these attacks and continue to uphold their oaths by doing only what the law dictates,"" it says.

""But it is up to the rest of us, and especially our elected representatives, to come to their defense and oppose any attempt by the President or others to improperly interfere in the Department's work, including by firing either Mr. Mueller, Mr. Rosenstein or other Department leadership or officials for the purpose of interfering in their investigations,"" the officials say.

""Should the President take such a step, we call on Congress to swiftly and forcefully respond to protect the founding principles of our Republic and the rule of law,"" the letter says.

170,1,0.0,"Declarações de ministro Gilmar Mendes sobre atuação de procurador Diogo Castor de Mattos na investigação são infundadas

A força-tarefa Lava Jato do Ministério Público Federal no Paraná (MPF/PR) foi surpreendida na data de ontem, 11 de abril de 2018, pela intervenção do ministro Gilmar Mendes na sessão do plenário do Supremo Tribunal Federal, a qual, com absoluta falta de seriedade, lançou contra o procurador da República Diogo Castor de Mattos notícias antigas e falsas a respeito do comportamento deste na Operação Lava Jato.

A fala do ministro Gilmar Mendes desbordou o equilíbrio e responsabilidade exigidos pelo seu cargo, fazendo não só acusações genéricas e sem provas contra a atuação do Ministério Público Federal, mas especialmente imputações falsas contra o procurador da República Diogo Castor de Mattos com base em notícias antigas e em suposto “ouvir dizer” de desconhecidos advogados, mentiras já devidamente rechaçadas em nota pela força-tarefa Lava Jato em Curitiba em 12 de maio de 2017 no seguinte sentido:

“A força-tarefa Lava Jato do MPF em Curitiba informa que o procurador da República Diogo Castor de Mattos não atuou e não atua em nenhum dos casos ou processos envolvendo o empresário João Santana de Cerqueira Filho. Além disso, o acordo de colaboração foi celebrado por Santana com a Procuradoria Geral da República (PGR) em 8 de março de 2017, antes do escritório Delivar de Mattos e Castor Advogados (que tem como um dos sócios Rodrigo Castor de Mattos, irmão do procurador) assumir a defesa do empresário em 17 de abril de 2017. O procurador atua na operação Lava Jato desde abril de 2014, enquanto o escritório ingressou na representação do réu em abril de 2017. Por fim, acrescenta-se que Rodrigo Castor de Mattos, embora permaneça como sócio do escritório citado, deixou a defesa de Santana em maio do ano passado”.

Como se pode ver, o procurador da República Diogo Castor de Mattos na força-tarefa Lava Jato não atuou na investigação de João Santana por decisão própria, indo além das exigências éticas e legais da magistratura, comportamento esse que o próprio ministro Gilmar Mendes não observou quanto ao seu impedimento em medidas judiciais relativas ao investigado Jacob Barata Filho.

A força-tarefa Lava Jato do MPF no Paraná presta estes esclarecimentos à população para não ficar indefesa diante do reiterado sentimento negativo do ministro Gilmar Mendes com o sucesso da Operação Lava Jato em desbaratar organizações criminosas que atuavam no poder público federal e com as mudanças positivas que o combate à corrupção trazem para a Justiça brasileira, bem como para mostrar sua indignação com o destemperado uso de falsas notícias e supostas intrigas de advogados desconhecidos em relação ao procurador da República Diogo Castor de Mattos.

After months of speculation, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle did not extend wedding invitations to Barack and Michelle Obama, and the hopes of seeing Barry O break out his best royal dance moves have effectively been dashed.  Rather than potentially ruffling the wispy hairs of a certain hugely sensitive American president, no politicians or official state representatives will be in attendance. Not even British Prime Minister Theresa May made the cut.

Harry and Meghan were previously strongly advised not to invite the Obamas for diplomatic reasons, despite Harry's friendly relationship with the former president and first lady. A Kensington Palace spokesperson confirmed to Daily Express reporter Richard Palmer that ""an official list of political leaders—both U. K. and international—is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle's wedding. Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.”

A KP spokesman says: “It has been decided that an official list of political leaders – both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle's wedding. Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.”— Richard Palmer (@RoyalReporter) April 10, 2018

Essentially, because Harry is about to become sixth in line for the throne, it's not really worth causing an international standoff due to hurt feelings. These days, it's perhaps too much to ask for world leaders to be more gracious than a third-grader who didn't get invited to the cool kids' party. I'm not saying President Trump's ego caused the decision not to invite politicians, but I'm not not saying that. The rejection tweetstorms alone might have caused WWIII.

Don't stress about Barack and Harry's friendship though—I know, it was really eating away at you—as sources tell the Daily Mail's Rebecca English that the Obamas ""are very much looking forward to seeing [Harry and Meghan] soon.""

Sources say that although Mr and Mrs Obama are not invited the couple 'are very much looking forward to seeing them soon'.

Still no word on the big story, though - was Mel B telling porkies when she said she was invited? #RoyalWedding— Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) April 10, 2018

Even without the Obamas in attendance, I'm sure Harry and Meghan's nuptials will still manage to garner some publicity.

173,1,0.0,"The rumors were true: House Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring from Congress. One of the most powerful political jobs in the United States will change hands next year, which will surely have a major effect on how the country is governed, but we’re here to discuss something slightly less weighty: the effect Ryan’s departure will have on his district — and the House of Representatives — this November.

Ryan’s national stature makes it easy to forget that he’s also the representative for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District, which stretches from his native Janesville in south-central Wisconsin to Racine and Kenosha on the Lake Michigan shore. The area is moderately to solidly Republican: No Democrat has won the district in a partisan statewide race since at least 2010, which is as far back as data for the district goes, and Ryan defeated his last two Democratic challengers there with 65 percent (2016) and 63 percent (2014) of the vote. However, Ryan (with his monster fundraising skills) was an incredibly strong incumbent, and the district is likely to be much more competitive without him on the ballot.

According to Daily Kos Elections, President Trump won the district 53 to 42 percent in 2016, while Mitt Romney carried it 52 to 47 percent in 2012. Going by FiveThirtyEight’s preferred calculation for a district’s partisan lean, the Wisconsin 1st is 11.3 percentage points more Republican than the nation as a whole. (For reference, the median House district is about 5 points more Republican than the country as a whole.) In a normal year, that means the Republican nominee should hold the seat easily. But 2018 isn’t shaping up to be a normal year: A sizable Democratic wave appears to be building that could be enough to overcome an 11-point handicap. Currently, the FiveThirtyEight generic-ballot tracker suggests Democrats will win the House popular vote by almost 7 percentage points; if Ryan’s district swings about 7 points toward Democrats in a reflection of the national mood, that could produce a close race for his old seat. Since Trump’s inauguration, Democrats in special elections have overcome far more daunting disadvantages.

Taken together, the combination of a potential Democratic wave and the fact that no incumbent will be running have put this district within reach for Democrats. Nonpartisan election handicappers such as Inside Elections and the Cook Political Report are already reflecting this new reality by moving the Wisconsin 1st from the “Solid Republican” category to “Lean Republican.”

But we still don’t know who will be in the race. Democrats have been excited about their chances here for a while thanks to internet sensation Randy Bryce, better known by his Twitter handle: “Iron Stache.” The Ron Swanson-esque ironworker had parlayed a viral launch video into a prodigious $2.3 million war chest as of the end of March, but he has also drawn criticism for being behind in his child-support payments, sending ill-advised tweets, and spending campaign money in questionable ways. Janesville school board member Cathy Myers is also seeking the Democratic nomination, and today’s news could embolden other Democrats to jump in as well.

For their part, Republicans have a deep bench in the district, which is home to no fewer than three Republican state senators and 10 Republican state representatives, according to RRH Elections, a conservative blog. Early GOP buzz has focused on state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and University of Wisconsin Regent Bryan Steil.

Though Ryan’s retirement may only directly cost the GOP one seat (if that), it’s also a symbolic blow to Republicans’ battle for House control. According to CNN’s House retirement tracker, 38 House Republicans, including Ryan, are not running for re-election this year, and 25 of them are retiring from politics completely (as opposed to running for higher office). That’s the most since World War II, according to the Brookings Institution. It also contrasts sharply with Democrats’ retirement numbers (17 open seats, nine outright retirements). That’s not the most reassuring set of numbers for Republicans, but a high number of retirements for one party doesn’t necessarily signal that that party will suffer huge losses in the following election. Instead, retirements can be an accurate reflector of how poor those incumbents perceive their electoral fortunes to be.

If Ryan’s decision in turn spurs more retirements — say, among his closest allies in the House or among Republicans in similarly borderline-competitive districts — Republican gloom and doom could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The advantages of incumbency may be shrinking, but they’re still very real. Every Republican retirement makes it a little bit harder, a little bit more expensive for the GOP to hold onto that seat — Ryan’s included.

Gov. John Bel Edwards answers questions from reporters about the legislative session, on Thursday, March 22, 2018, in Baton Rouge, La. (AP Photo/Melinda Deslatte) ORG XMIT: RPMD101()

Louisiana's decision to expand Medicaid in 2016 led to a $1.85 billion direct economic impact, according to an economic impact report released Tuesday (April 11).

The report called Medicaid Expansion and the Louisiana Economy was commissioned by the Louisiana Department of Health and prepared by Dr. Jim Richardson and the Public Administration Institute at Louisiana State University.

Gov. John Bel Edwards touted the findings in the report that highlighted how Medicaid expansion in Louisiana helped the state save $317 million and create 19,000 new jobs.

While saving money, $317 million, and growing the economy, the primary purpose of Medicaid expansion is to save lives. With more than 470,000 people enrolled, we are accomplishing our goal. Medicaid expansion is good for our people and good for LA's economy. #lagov #lalege https://t.co/qSMLsqvxuI

-- John Bel Edwards (@LouisianaGov) April 10, 2018

The program which provides health coverage for people with income less than 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level now covers a total of 471,115 people across the state according to the Department of Health.

The findings come as Louisiana faces an estimated budget shortfall of $994 million dollars in the state general fund next year. About $657 million of those cuts come from health care services, according to Edwards proposed budget.

These are some of the highlights from the report explaining the health impact on Medicaid enrollees since 2016:

35,733 - The number of women who have gotten screened for breast cancer with 338 being diagnosed.

21,037--The number of adults who received colon cancer screening, with 285 diagnosed with colon cancer.

6,922- The number of adults newly diagnosed and being treated for Diabetes.

175,1,,"Until early Wednesday morning, Paul Nehlen was little more than a racist, anti-Semitic sideshow in Wisconsin politics. Unless you happen to be a white supremacist, chances are you’ve never heard of him. His political résumé consists of one failed 2016 bid to capture the Republican nomination for a congressional race in Wisconsin, and a favorable shoutout from fellow white supremacist Donald Trump on Twitter.

Paul Nehlen was not to be taken seriously, until suddenly he became the Republican front-runner to defend the congressional seat currently held by the most powerful Republican in the House of Representatives.

On Wednesday, reports began circulating that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) would not seek reelection in the November midterms. Pundits have long suspected Ryan might call it quits sometime this year, facing the prospect of a difficult re-election and a Democratic wave that could push him out of his Speaker’s chair. But most figured the 48-year-old congressman would at least campaign for re-election.

Instead, Ryan says he plans to retire when his term ends, leaving Wisconsin Republicans scrambling to find someone to run against likely Democratic candidate Randy Bryce. Which means for now, Nehlen is the most likely GOP nominee in a district Donald Trump won by 10 points in 2016.

Nehlen’s first primary challenge against Ryan was unremarkable. He made a few headlines by endorsing Trump’s campaign early, something Ryan himself was reluctant to do. Sarah Palin publicly supported Nehlen’s insurgent campaign, but it ultimately did no good: Ryan captured his party’s nomination with almost 85 percent of the vote.

But after Donald Trump’s inauguration, Nehlen — like so many other virulent white supremacists and neo-Nazis — was emboldened. He began openly embracing classic anti-Semitic rhetoric, sharing deeply offensive memes on Twitter and the online white supremacist clearinghouse Gab. Whatever hesitation he had to publicly share his racist views melted away as well.

His online behavior finally got him banned from Twitter in February, when he attacked actress Meghan Markle for her biracial genealogy.

He isn’t without his supporters, though. As he alienated more and more normal Americans, he gained notoriety among the drudgery of the internet. During a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last year in which a peaceful protester was murdered, Nehlen tweeted messages of support for the rally’s organizers, saying “Incredible moment for white people who’ve had it up to here & aren’t going to take it anymore.” After a white supremacist participant was revealed to be the murderer, Nehlen echoed Donald Trump’s response, blaming bad actors on both sides for the  incident.

Nehlen’s comments earned him favorable coverage by white supremacist media outlets like the podcasts of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke and crying Nazi Christopher Cantwell, as well as Breitbart, which tried — unsuccessfully — to scrub their fawning coverage of Nehlen.

So toxic is Nehlen’s rhetoric that he’s even been banned from Gab.ai, an alternative social media platform established primarily for the benefit white supremacists and others who have been kicked off of Twitter for violating the terms of service. Nehlen was responsible for doxxing a pro-Trump online troll known as Ricky Vaughn, purportedly because Vaughn (real name Douglass Mackey) lobbied against events like the one in Charlottesville in favor of sticking to online manipulation.

For its part, the Republican Party of Wisconsin has disavowed their new frontrunner. “Nehlen and his ideas have no place in the Republican Party,” said party spokesman Alec Zimmerman in February. Nehlen, who is still running as a Republican in August’s primary, disagrees.

176,1,,"WASHINGTON, D. C. — Growling and surrounded by a crew of cameramen and bodyguards, Alex Jones trudged up to the National Press Club in Washington D.C. on Tuesday morning to begin his invasion of the swamp.

The Infowars host, who’s become America’s most famous conspiracy theorist, was ostensibly on hand to deliver a speech on the First Amendment and talk about the number of defamation lawsuits currently being leveled against Infowars. But, perhaps unsurprisingly for longtime fans of Jones’ Great Works, the event rapidly morphed into a paranoia free-for-all, with Jones raving at length about degenerate universities, gay frogs, meth-snorting SJWs and, of course, the ever-looming bogeyman that is George Soros.

For devotees of the more conspiracy-friendly sections of the right-wing media, this event was an all-star affair. Along with Jones, Infowars correspondent Jerome Corsi, who has been permanently banned from YouTube, was also present, as was Pizzagate-proponent Jack Posobiec, Lucian Wintrich of the fake-news promoting Gateway Pundit, and Roger Stone. Perhaps it was no coincidence that, with this chorus of colorful characters, no signs or decorations from the National Press Club were present in the room where Jones gave his remarks.

Alex Jones has said ""God bless you brother"" in the hallway outside his presser at least 5 times

The latest lawsuit driving Jones into his trademarked apoplexy was filed this March by Brennan Gilmore, a Foreign Service Officer, with the help of attorneys at the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic. Gilmore alleges that, after he posted a video of James Alex Fields ramming his car into a crowd during the Charlottesville protest last August, Jones inspired death threats and harassment against him by claiming Gilmore was a “deep state” operative trying to undermine the Trump administration.

Infowars, naturally, disagrees. “Rather than exercise his right to address the speech he challenges in the marketplace of ideas, Gilmore has chosen to go to court to silence Jones and others,” Infowars’ 30-page motion to dismiss reads, “[Gilmore’s] launch[ed] a media blitz to publicize the lawsuit and smear Jones, and to harass and burden the defendants with frivolous litigation.”

Jones didn’t elaborate on just how Gilmore can be fairly said to be successfully competing in the “marketplace of ideas” against a media outlet which regularly pulls in tens of millions of views and has previously had the ear of the President. Instead, he used the lawsuit as a jumping-off point to talk about two of his favorite subjects; how everything/everyone that disagrees with Infowars is funded by George Soros, and how much the mainstream media sucks.

“The whole [Georgetown Law Clinic] board is Soros-funded, it’s just incredible,” Jones said in a voice that sounded like grinding gravel. “They will defame you and call you a Nazi and say you deserve to die, that’s the universities, they’re now Maoist centers.”

“What we have here is mainly alternative new media, you don’t see mainstream corporate media here,” Jones continued. “They have decided to unify behind a project and an operation that the CEO of Newscorp openly talked about two months ago to end the First Amendment.”

I’ve always wondered how many of Jones’ endless rants the man actually believes, or whether he, as his lawyer claimed in family court last April, is actually a “performance artist” who’s latched on to an incredibly popular, and salable, type of paranoia. On screen and in person, Jones seems to move at a hundred miles an hour, each lie quickly covered up by an even bigger one, with changes in topic coming so furiously often that you’ll be left doubting your own sanity. Taken as a whole, against a backdrop that pits “real America” against a faceless, globalist conspiracy, it’s easy to see why people get ensnared.

At his National Press Club appearance, Jones’ well-worn shtick was all capably backed up by his supporting cast, most notably by swamp-dwelling dandy Roger Stone. “The real story here is that the American left is no longer interested in dialogue or debate,” he declared, in a smooth style that played well off Jones’ hit-you-over-the-head-until-you-believe-the-globalists-are-coming-for-you routine. “They can’t win a debate, they don’t want a discussion of issues. The answer when we raise facts and issues is ‘silence them, censor them, close them down!’”

Stone remains a continued person of interest in the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Just last week, an August 2016 email surfaced in which Stone mentioned having “dine[d] with my new pal Julian Assange last nite” – which would seem to imply he had foreknowledge of WikiLeaks’ upcoming release of Hillary Clinton’s emails. Stone later claimed that the email was “in jest”, a point he doubled-down on during the event on Tuesday

“I had no advanced knowledge of the contents, source, or exact timing of Wikileaks disclosures,” Stone said. “I have never received anything from WikiLeaks or Julian Assange, or the Russians, or anyone else.”

But while Jones and Stone may cast themselves as put-upon political martyrs, the reality is that their speech and theories have had a disturbing impact.

In December 2016, a man brought an AR-15 to a pizza restaurant in Washington D. C. with the intention of investigating the fake Pizzagate conspiracy, which Jones had helped propagate. Last June, a Florida woman was sentenced to five months in prison for threatening the father of a Sandy Hook shooting victim. Alex Jones has repeatedly claimed that Sandy Hook was a hoax. In March, Jones was almost kicked off YouTube for popularizing the idea that the Parkland school survivors were in fact ‘crisis actors’.

I asked Jones whether he thought his rhetoric could, potentially, make someone do something stupid. “I’m particularly worried that they’re gonna have a leftist go do some kind of kamikaze attack to false flag me,” Jones responded. “I know that’s being worked on behind the scene.”

When I asked Jones how it was that he knew it was being “worked on,” he rambled for a few seconds before directing me towards an unnamed public document that claimed George Soros’ son was trying to create martial law in Maryland with the help of a race war, and that the public would be manipulated into burning the “city” — presumably Baltimore — down to the ground.

Tragically at this point my fleeting encounter with Jones headed south. “You guys think you’re intellectuals, you don’t know shit,” he declaimed. Aiming his barbs at Right Wing Watch’s Jared Holt and myself, Jones declared himself to be aghast that we did not know that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was, in fact, one of the two active shadow governments in the United States. “You guys all intellectually with your plastic haircuts ohhh uhhh ohhh Soros what did he do ohhh uhhh ohhh.”

It was at this point that Jones began dancing around in front of us.

“You guys just want to pretend you talked to me,” Jones then told us later in the lobby. “It’s just a prop. Make up whatever you’re going to make up.”

As Jones exited the building, he was accosted by a camera crew, at which he quickly started shouting.

177,1,,"Bannon pitches White House on plan to cripple Mueller probe and protect Trump

Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former top strategist, says the White House should stop cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Muller III and assert executive privilege. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)    Stephen K. Bannon, who was ousted as White House chief strategist last summer but has remained in touch with some members of President Trump’s circle, is pitching a plan to West Wing aides and congressional allies to cripple the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to four people familiar with the discussions. The first step, these people say, would be for Trump to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees the work of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and in recent days signed off on a search warrant of Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. Bannon is also recommending the White House cease its cooperation with Mueller, reversing the policy of Trump’s legal team to provide information to the special counsel’s team and to allow staff members to sit for interviews. And he is telling associates inside and outside the administration that the president should create a new legal battleground to protect himself from the investigation by asserting executive privilege — and arguing that Mueller’s interviews with White House officials over the past year should now be null and void. “The president wasn’t fully briefed by his lawyers on the implications” of not invoking executive privilege, Bannon told The Washington Post in an interview Wednesday. “It was a strategic mistake to turn over everything without due process, and executive privilege should be exerted immediately and retroactively.” There is no indication that Trump, who forced out Bannon and later said his former adviser had “lost his mind” after leaving the West Wing, would be willing to take Bannon’s advice or is aware of the plan. Several Trump aides also remain skeptical of the former strategist’s attempt to insert himself into the president’s decision-making process. “If you say his name in front of the president, it’s not a pretty sight,” said a senior administration official. “The president really goes off about him.”  Nonetheless, Bannon’s efforts signify the growing pressure from an influential wing of Trump’s political base to thwart Mueller, who, many Trump allies believe, presents an existential legal and political threat to his presidency.  Trump boosters in Congress are preparing to take legislative action against Rosenstein and other Justice officials over the disclosure of documents related to the Russia investigation. That push is seen by Bannon and others in the White House as a cause that could prompt Trump to act and shift much of the Russia investigation to Capitol Hill, where Republicans control both chambers. Trump remains furious with the Mueller probe, which on Wednesday he blasted on Twitter as “never ending and corrupt.” He has also considered firing Rosenstein, whom he has criticized for approving surveillance applications of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, which extended a warrant that partly relied on information that was funded in a roundabout way by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Bannon and his allies sense that Trump simply needs a nudge to fire Rosenstein, according to the people familiar with Bannon’s discussions. They said Trump has recently told friends and aides that he is willing to engage in political warfare in the coming months to stop his presidency from being consumed by the investigation. Bannon’s conversations, including a meeting Tuesday night between the former strategist and Trump confidants, have so far remained through back channels.  The 64-year-old strategist has huddled in recent days — at his Capitol Hill townhouse, a Washington hotel and over the phone — with a handful of White House aides, GOP lawmakers and conservative media figures who speak frequently with Trump, according to people involved, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Bannon’s standing within Trump’s orbit is tenuous. In January, lawyers for Trump accused Bannon of breaking a confidentiality agreement by making critical comments about Trump and his family in “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” by Michael Wolff. Ever since, Bannon has seen his domestic political operation — which was focused on the 2018 midterm elections — fizzle, and his attention has turned abroad to boosting far-right nationalist candidates in Europe, giving speeches and promoting his hard-line views on global affairs. Amid all of that activity, he has regularly spoken with White House officials and lawmakers about Trump and offered informal guidance on issues such as trade and the Russia investigation. Bannon, who has been interviewed extensively by Mueller’s team, remains sensitive about directly approaching Trump with his call to fire Rosenstein and curb Justice’s grip over the Russia probe, the people added, noting that federal investigators could raise questions about such exchanges. Some top Trump advisers, such as White House counsel Donald McGahn, are said to be alarmed by the suggestions to fire Rosenstein or Mueller, worrying that such moves could prompt mass resignations at Justice and a constitutional crisis, the people said. McGahn, who in the past has threatened to step down if the president fired Mueller, is widely seen within the West Wing as liable to resign if Rosenstein is fired. “A guy leaning on a mop over at the Justice Department may be the guy who ends up firing Mueller,” one person said. Asked Wednesday afternoon whether Trump would be pushing out Rosenstein, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “I don’t have any personnel announcements.” But she offered no words of support for Rosenstein, signaling that the deputy attorney general’s job may be in jeopardy. Later Wednesday, a White House spokesman pointed to Huckabee Sanders’s news conference when asked for comment about Bannon. Legal experts are dubious about Bannon’s idea that the White House could suddenly claim executive privilege on interviews that were given voluntarily by officials and be able to exclude them from an investigation that is partly reliant on those interviews. But Bannon believes Trump can argue he was given poor counsel by his lawyers on Russia, including Ty Cobb, who has encouraged a cooperative approach to Mueller’s team. “Ty Cobb should be fired immediately,” Bannon said.  The case against Rosenstein has featured prominently in the closed-door discussions among Bannon and other figures on the right, with Bannon arguing that voters in the GOP base will stick by the president if he removes Rosenstein despite protests from Republican leaders and many others. Rosenstein’s approval of the Cohen warrant, which led to raids Monday on Cohen’s home and office, has angered Trump and prompted him to vent over the past day about Rosenstein being “out of control,” one Republican lawmaker said.  If Rosenstein were fired, his replacement could reel in the authority that Mueller was granted last year and set new parameters for the scope of the Russia investigation, according to Louis Seidman, a constitutional-law professor at Georgetown University. “Depending on how aggressive this person wanted to be, they could dismiss the criminal cases, they could get rid of the grand jury,” Seidman said. “In the end, if Trump is determined, the people he appoints could shut it down.” For Bannon, this hostility to Mueller represents an evolution. A year ago, he opposed the firing of then-FBI Director James B. Comey and recommended a hands-off approach to the Russia investigation and Justice. “I have the upmost respect for Bob Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but the developments over the past two weeks make it the right time to shift the center of gravity of this back to Capitol Hill,” Bannon said. “Make the Republican Party own this, force them to have his back.”      {comment_count=0, correction_html=, keywords=[bob mueller, rod j. rosenstein, trump, the white house, bannon], web_headline=Bannon pitches White House on plan to cripple Mueller probe and protect Trump, deck=, site_service={parent=/, in_the_news={in_the_news_usefeature=sitewide, in_the_news_usebasepage=/in-the-news-forsections/, in_the_news_usesectionbar=true}, social={archives=null, twitter=https://twitter.com/postpolitics, rss=http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/politics, facebook=https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostpolitics}, site_topper={social_link_display_order=null, display_social_links=null, custom_links_highlight=, site_logo_image=null, custom_links=[Courts & Law^https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts-law/, Polling^https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/polling/, PowerPost^https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/, White House^https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house/, 'Can He Do That?'^https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/can-he-do-that-trump-podcast/], site_background_image=null}, site={archives_url=[], pagebuilder_path_for_native_apps=/politics/, site_url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/, site_keywords=postpolitics,post politics,politics,washington post politics,politics news,political news,washington post politics news,post politics news,washington post,white house news,breaking politics news,washington post political news,congress news,election,election news,supreme court news,washington postpolitics,breaking political news,political news updates, pagebuilder_path_for_native_apps_tablet=/tablet-app-politics/, site_about=null, site_description=Post Politics from The Washington Post is the source for political news headlines, in-depth politics coverage and political opinion, plus breaking news on the Obama administration and White House, Congress, the Supreme Court, elections and more., site_theme=null, site_title=Politics, site_tagline=null}, navigation={nav_title=Politics, display_in_top_strip=true, nav_display=true}, _admin={tracking_node=/politics, alias_ids=[/politics], commercial_node=/politics, default_content=/WashingtonPost/Production/Digital/Pages-Tablet/politics/_module-content/refresh-query-ipadpolitics-new}, inactive=false, name=Politics, story_list={display_social_share_buttons=true, social_share_buttons=null, story_list_content={list_main-content-chain-1-highlight_label=The Fix, list_section-main-content-lead_content=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/?query=/WashingtonPost/Production/Digital/Queries/site-service/politics/politics-hero, list_main-content-chain-1-highlight_content=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/, list_main-content-chain-1-highlight_link=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/}}, _id=/politics, _comments_config={comments_config={comment_system=coral, includetabs=true, comment_system_date=2017-08-23T00:00, markersfeatured=featured_comment}}, order=1002}, source=The Washington Post, taxonomy={keywords=[bob mueller, rod j. rosenstein, trump, the white house, bannon], categories=null, custom_taxonomy=null, tags=[]}, type=article, uuid=1ec5b1b2-3d9f-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0, primary_slot={organization=The Washington Post, name=Matt McClain, resize_base=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/, caption=Stephen K.

Bannon, who was ousted as White House chief strategist last summer but has remained in touch with some members of President Trump’s circle, is pitching a plan to West Wing aides and congressional allies to cripple the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to four people familiar with the discussions.</p> <p>The first step, these people say, would be for Trump to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees the work of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and in recent days signed off on a search warrant of Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.</p> <p>Bannon is also recommending the White House cease its cooperation with Mueller, reversing the policy of Trump’s legal team to provide information to the special counsel’s team and to allow staff members to sit for interviews.</p> <p>And he is telling associates inside and outside the administration that the president should create a new legal battleground to protect himself from the investigation by asserting executive privilege — and arguing that Mueller’s interviews with White House officials over the past year should now be null and void.</p> <p>“The president wasn’t fully briefed by his lawyers on the implications” of not invoking executive privilege, Bannon told The Washington Post in an interview Wednesday. “It was a strategic mistake to turn over everything without due process, and executive privilege should be exerted immediately and retroactively.”</p><div></div> <p>There is no indication that Trump, who forced out Bannon and later said his former adviser had “lost his mind” after leaving the West Wing, would be willing to take Bannon’s advice or is aware of the plan. Several Trump aides also remain skeptical of the former strategist’s attempt to insert himself into the president’s decision-making process.</p> <p>“If you say his name in front of the president, it’s not a pretty sight,” said a senior administration official. “The president really goes off about him.”</p> <p> Nonetheless, Bannon’s efforts signify the growing pressure from an influential wing of Trump’s political base to thwart Mueller, who, many Trump allies believe, presents an existential legal and political threat to his presidency. </p> <p>Trump boosters in Congress are preparing to take legislative action against Rosenstein and other Justice officials over the disclosure of documents related to the Russia investigation. That push is seen by Bannon and others in the White House as a cause that could prompt Trump to act and shift much of the Russia investigation to Capitol Hill, where Republicans control both chambers.</p> <p>Trump remains furious with the Mueller probe, which on Wednesday he blasted on Twitter as “never ending and corrupt.” He has also considered firing Rosenstein, whom he has criticized for approving surveillance applications of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, which extended a warrant that partly relied on information that was funded in a roundabout way by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>Bannon and his allies sense that Trump simply needs a nudge to fire Rosenstein, according to the people familiar with Bannon’s discussions. They said Trump has recently told friends and aides that he is willing to engage in political warfare in the coming months to stop his presidency from being consumed by the investigation.</p> <p>Bannon’s conversations, including a meeting Tuesday night between the former strategist and Trump confidants, have so far remained through back channels. </p><div></div> <p>The 64-year-old strategist has huddled in recent days — at his Capitol Hill townhouse, a Washington hotel and over the phone — with a handful of White House aides, GOP lawmakers and conservative media figures who speak frequently with Trump, according to people involved, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.</p> <p>Bannon’s standing within Trump’s orbit is tenuous. In January, lawyers for Trump accused Bannon of breaking a confidentiality agreement by making critical comments about Trump and his family in “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” by Michael Wolff.</p> <p>Ever since, Bannon has seen his domestic political operation — which was focused on the 2018 midterm elections — fizzle, and his attention has turned abroad to boosting far-right nationalist candidates in Europe, giving speeches and promoting his hard-line views on global affairs. Amid all of that activity, he has regularly spoken with White House officials and lawmakers about Trump and offered informal guidance on issues such as trade and the Russia investigation.</p> <p>Bannon, who has been interviewed extensively by Mueller’s team, remains sensitive about directly approaching Trump with his call to fire Rosenstein and curb Justice’s grip over the Russia probe, the people added, noting that federal investigators could raise questions about such exchanges.</p> <p>Some top Trump advisers, such as White House counsel Donald McGahn, are said to be alarmed by the suggestions to fire Rosenstein or Mueller, worrying that such moves could prompt mass resignations at Justice and a constitutional crisis, the people said. McGahn, who in the past has threatened to step down if the president fired Mueller, is widely seen within the West Wing as liable to resign if Rosenstein is fired.</p> <p>“A guy leaning on a mop over at the Justice Department may be the guy who ends up firing Mueller,” one person said.</p> <p>Asked Wednesday afternoon whether Trump would be pushing out Rosenstein, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “I don’t have any personnel announcements.” But she offered no words of support for Rosenstein, signaling that the deputy attorney general’s job may be in jeopardy. Later Wednesday, a White House spokesman pointed to Huckabee Sanders’s news conference when asked for comment about Bannon.</p> <p>Legal experts are dubious about Bannon’s idea that the White House could suddenly claim executive privilege on interviews that were given voluntarily by officials and be able to exclude them from an investigation that is partly reliant on those interviews. But Bannon believes Trump can argue he was given poor counsel by his lawyers on Russia, including Ty Cobb, who has encouraged a cooperative approach to Mueller’s team.</p> <p>“Ty Cobb should be fired immediately,” Bannon said.</p> <p>Cobb declined to comment.</p> <p>The case against Rosenstein has featured prominently in the closed-door discussions among Bannon and other figures on the right, with Bannon arguing that voters in the GOP base will stick by the president if he removes Rosenstein despite protests from Republican leaders and many others.</p> <p>Rosenstein’s approval of the Cohen warrant, which led to raids Monday on Cohen’s home and office, has angered Trump and prompted him to vent over the past day about Rosenstein being “out of control,” one Republican lawmaker said. </p> <p>If Rosenstein were fired, his replacement could reel in the authority that Mueller was granted last year and set new parameters for the scope of the Russia investigation, according to Louis Seidman, a constitutional-law professor at Georgetown University.</p> <p>“Depending on how aggressive this person wanted to be, they could dismiss the criminal cases, they could get rid of the grand jury,” Seidman said. “In the end, if Trump is determined, the people he appoints could shut it down.”</p> <p>For Bannon, this hostility to Mueller represents an evolution. A year ago, he opposed the firing of then-FBI Director James B. Comey and recommended a hands-off approach to the Russia investigation and Justice.</p> <p>“I have the upmost respect for Bob Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but the developments over the past two weeks make it the right time to shift the center of gravity of this back to Capitol Hill,” Bannon said. “Make the Republican Party own this, force them to have his back.”</p> <p class=""trailer""> <p>Ashley Parker, Karoun Demirjian, Carol D.

179,1,,"Google “Paul Ryan budget serious,” and you’ll be swamped with 22 million results. Add the word “adult,” and 239,000 results will appear. There’s been much musing within the politerati that the Wisconsin Republican’s proposed 2012 budget, which was released on Tuesday and would slash Medicaid and privatize Medicare, is not helpful for Republicans during the high-stakes showdown over spending cuts and a possible government shutdown. But within elite opinion, Rep. Ryan, the influential and wonky chairman of the House budget committee, has won perhaps the most vaunted accolade in Washington: “adult.”

MSNBC talk-show host Joe Scarborough, a former GOP House member, hailed Ryan’s “adult conversation.” Time‘s Joe Klein praised Ryan’s proposal as “an act of political courage” (while taking sharp issue with specific provisions). The subhead on Jacob Weisberg’s review of the plan in Slate noted that it’s “brave, radical, and smart.” Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, who recently chaired a national commission on the deficit, called Ryan’s budget “a serious, honest, straightforward approach to addressing our nation’s enormous fiscal challenges.”

Yet how courageous is it to whack poor folks and promote tax cuts that favor the wealthy? That’s the core of Ryan’s budget. Even deficit hawks like Bowles and Simpson recognize this. In the same statement touting Ryan’s endeavor, the two declare that Ryan’s plan

relies on much larger reductions in domestic discretionary spending than does the Commission proposal, while also calling for savings in some safety net programs—cuts which would place a disproportionately adverse effect on certain disadvantaged populations.

Here’s the bottom line: In conventional Washington, squeezing the poor, while boosting the rich, is not  considered a nonstarter.

Ryan’s budget has received plenty of attention for the provisions that would turn Medicaid into a block grant program that would provide limited grants to states (thus ending any guarantee of coverage for the poor) and would transform Medicare into a privatized system controlled by insurance companies (thus ending any guarantee of coverage for the elderly). Less discussed—especially by Ryan!—is the part of his plan that would implement a massive regressive tax cut. As Jonathan Chait points out: “He cuts Medicare and other vital programs in order to finance a huge tax cut for people who don’t really need it. That’s the point Republicans don’t want to defend but should be forced to.”

Ryan contends that his proposed revisions to Medicare and Medicaid—that is, cuts—are necessary to save these critical programs. But these cuts and revisions are necessary to finance his major tax cut for the well-to-do. His plan, then, is intellectually dishonest at its core. Which doesn’t seem very adult.

The basics are not debatable. Kaiser Health News reports that “seniors and the disabled would pay sharply more for their Medicare coverage” under Ryan’s proposal. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that two-thirds of the $4.3 trillion cuts in Ryan’s plan come from low-income programs, while the Bush bonus tax cuts for high-income Americans are made permanent and estate taxes for the super-rich are ended. People with incomes over $1 million would be handed an average tax cut of $125,000 a year. As the CPBB observes,

Taken together, its proposals would produce the largest redistribution of income from the bottom to the top in modern U. S. history, while increasing poverty and inequality more than any measure in recent times and possibly in the nation’s history.

Ryan is indeed breaking new ground…in brazenness. He is boldly (bravely?) reinforcing the fundamental stereotype of Republicans: Screw the poor, aid the rich. This plan is a full embrace of his inner Republican. Though it may be politically gutsy to call for altering a popular program like Medicare, it is hardly courageous to mug the poor and the elderly to underwrite a tax bonanza for the wealthy. The hosannas Ryan is receiving reveal the perverted perspective of much of the political class. He has declared class warfare on the have-nots. And for that, he is admired.

182,1,,"Did Florida Governor Rick Scott adopt a dog during his campaign and return it once he was elected?

Florida Governor Rick Scott adopted a dog during his campaign and returned it once he was elected.

Florida Governor Rick Scott adopted a rescue dog during his campaign and returned the animal after he was elected.

Scott sought to adopt a dog for purely political reasons and got rid of the pet when dog ownership was no longer politically expedient.

I saw a post on facebook that said the governor of Florida, Rick Scott, posed with a shelter dog to win an election, then returned it to

the shelter.

In August 2010,  Rick Scott won nomination as the Republican candidate in the Florida gubernatorial race. Before Scott defeated opponent Alex Sink by a margin of  in the general election to become the  of Florida, he adopted a shelter dog.

Scott’s Facebook page crowdsourced a name for the dog during his candidacy. When the pet’s adoption was complete, the page was updated to inform supporters of the dog’s new name:

The Scott family is proud to announce that the name (chosen by you) for their newly adopted pup is Reagan! Thanks to everyone who participated in the fun contest.

Scott was spotted walking Reagan a day before he was sworn in as governor, but the dog soon disappeared from the public eye, and Scott’s camp became reluctant to discuss the pet. Reagan’s notable absence dogged Scott’s campaign staff, and by January 2013, the Tampa Bay Times began investigating the animal’s whereabouts.

On  2014, the paper reported meeting resistance from Scott’s staff on the issue of Reagan:

Brian Burgess, communications director during the campaign and for more than a year after Scott took office, now holds a similar position for the state GOP. When a Times reporter asked him where the dog is, Burgess said he thought it “weird” that two Times reporters would contact him six minutes apart with questions dating back to the 2010 campaign.

But he wouldn’t say where the dog was and accused reporters of “surfing some old Facebook or website pages.” At one point an exasperated reporter asked Burgess if he had killed the dog, and Burgess denied ever killing a dog, but still wouldn’t say where Reagan was.

Burgess testily emailed that he was working on an answer and recognized “the potential for a PR nightmare if the Tampa Bay Times doesn’t receive a photo of Reagan next to today’s copy of the Tampa Bay Times. So take it to the bank I’m getting you every bit of info I can lay my hands on.”

Burgess said he was referring all questions about the dog to Melissa Sellers, the governor’s new communications director. Sellers responded over two days that she was far too busy to find an answer to the question.

A representative for Scott’s wife, Ann, was similarly unwilling to discuss Reagan, confirming the family had a dog named Tallee who was also a rescue animal. Ultimately, the paper directly confronted Scott about Reagan’s whereabouts and got an answer.

According to the governor, Reagan had behavioral issues with which he and his staff were  to cope.  explained that while Reagan didn’t harm anyone, his demeanor nonetheless frightened several staff members. As such, he explained, the family was forced to  Reagan as the adoption was a poor fit for both staffers and the dog himself:

“He was a rescue dog,” Scott said, “and he couldn’t be around anybody that was carrying anything, and so he wouldn’t get better.”

Scott said Reagan never bit anyone but “scared the living daylights” out of people at the mansion. He said one kitchen employee threatened to quit and photographer Eric Tournay was frightened when the dog “barked like crazy” every time he saw him with a camera.

So the Scotts gave the dog back to his prior owner, Scott said, about a month after the family moved to Tallahassee. The governor’s office said it was trying to find Reagan and its new family.

Scott told the paper Tallee was also a “needy” dog but described behavior that was not as upsetting to staffers as Reagan’s had been. It was later confirmed Reagan had been returned to All Pets Grooming and Boarding in Naples, Florida, but it was not clear whether he was subsequently

Social media sites have dredged up the fate of Reagan upon occasion, reviving interest in the situation anew each time a prominent animal lover’s page features the story.

While it’s true Florida Gov. Rick Scott adopted a shelter dog during the 2010 election and later returned the pet to a shelter, the fact he quickly adopted another shelter dog suggests Reagan was indeed a bad fit for the family and the Governor’s mansion and was not simply a prop rented for the election season and discarded afterwards. Had Scott truly only adopted the dog for good press, it’s unlikely the family would have immediately taken in another shelter pet after surrendering the first one.

184,1,,"A judge handling one of the criminal cases against Paul Manafort has again denied bail to the former Trump campaign chairman, but this time the court gave Manafort what could amount to a financial road map to securing his release.

U. S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said in an order Monday that Manafort had again fallen short in the latest of several attempts to assemble money, property and pledges to meet the $10 million bail amount she set in the money-laundering and unregistered foreign lobbying case brought against him in Washington by special counsel Robert Mueller.

The new order is the latest development in an unusually prolonged bail saga for the longtime political consultant, who has been under house arrest since his first court appearance in the case last October.

Jackson said she would not accept two properties Manafort has sought to propose as part of his bail package: a condo in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, and another property in New York City. The judge said the Alexandria property is not suitable because it was pledged to back a mortgage on Manafort's Long Island home. She said the New York property isn't an appropriate security because it is a focus of a separate bank-and-tax-fraud case Mueller's prosecutors filed against Manafort in Alexandria in February.

However, Jackson said other properties could make up a bail package for Manafort, including his Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, home and his condo in Trump Tower in New York. The judge cautioned that Manafort would have to show that he ""is current on his mortgage obligation"" for the Trump Tower apartment. Manafort at one point fell behind on payments, something his attorneys blamed on a change in a bill-paying vendor.

The Virginia indictment has complicated the bail situation further, since Manafort is now subject to the rulings of two judges. The judge in Alexandria, T. S. Ellis III, initially ordered what he called ""home incarceration"" for Manafort at his Alexandria condo under conditions similar to the ones Jackson imposed.

However, Ellis has indicated he'd considering lifting some of those conditions if Manafort were to post enough money or assets to ensure that he would appear for future court dates.

In the wake of a court filing last week that revealed prosecutors' efforts to seize funds at three banks last October, one day before Manafort and business partner Rick Gates were indicted, Jackson disclosed in her order Monday that one of the accounts prosecutors took control of was in the names of Manafort's daughter Andrea and her husband, Christopher Shand. Jackson said that account, the value of which was not stated, was not appropriate security for Paul Manafort's bail because of the involvement of Shand, who is not ""a blood relative"" of Manafort.

In a separate order on Monday, Jackson granted Manafort's defense team a last-minute extension to argue that evidence the FBI seized from his Alexandria condo in a early morning raid last July should be barred from use against him in the Washington case. Manafort's defense asked for the extension about 90 minutes before the Friday midnight deadline she set for such motions. She noted that she'd told both sides to submit any extension requests 48 hours ahead of time, but she approved it anyway.

Ellis has set July 10 for Manafort's trial to open in the Virginia case, while Jackson has set a Sept. 17 trial date for Manafort in the D. C. case.

185,1,,"First, Gov. Rick Scott scared the bejesus out of seniors with an online ad claiming that Medicare rate cuts would lead them to lose access to their doctors, hospitals and preventive care.

Then, the Florida Democratic Party fired back at Scott, issuing a press release that called Scott ""the ultimate Medicare thief.""

The Democrats were referring to Scott’s prior tenure as CEO of Columbia/HCA about a decade ago, when the hospital company was fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud.

""Rick Scott is saying Democrats are committing Medicare robbery, when in fact he's the ultimate Medicare thief. He lost the right to accuse Democrats of raiding Medicare when he oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation's history. Rick Scott's company stole money that should have gone to health care for seniors,"" said Florida Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp in the Feb. 25 press release.

Separately, we have fact-checked Scott’s claim ""we are seeing dramatic rate cuts"" to Medicare that will affect people's choice of doctor, hospital and preventive care. We concluded that Scott had failed to say that the rate cut only applies to Medicare Advantage, and thus only affects a fraction of all Medicare beneficiaries. Also, it could be several months before we know the actual impact of the cut which could vary county by county. We rated Scott's claim Mostly False.

Here, we’ll fact-check the Democratic counter-attack that Scott ""oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history.""

During Scott’s 2010 race for governor, PolitiFact fact-checked multiple claims related to his tenure at Columbia/HCA. Now, we’ll recap some of our earlier discussion of the investigation and fine.

Scott started what was first Columbia in 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he would add hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies.

In 1997, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. The investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed Medicare and Medicaid fraud.

Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy.

During his 2010 race, the Miami Herald reported that Scott had said he would have immediately stopped his company from committing fraud -- if only ""somebody told me something was wrong."" But there were such warnings in the company’s annual public reports to stockholders -- which Scott had to sign as president and CEO.

Scott wanted to fight the accusations, but the corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle.

In December 2000, the U. S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties.

Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement:

• Columbia billed Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or had not been ordered by physicians;

• The company attached false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals;

• The company illegally claimed non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education;

• Columbia billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them.

The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion.

On Scott’s 2010 campaign website, he admitted to the $1.7 billion fine, though the link is no longer on the site.

What type of record was that fine?

The fine clearly set a record, though the Justice Department (and media reports at the time) were not always consistent in their terminology, sometimes describing it as the ""largest government fraud settlement in U. S. History"" and other times more specifically as the ""largest health care fraud case in U.S. History.""

A Justice Department spokeswoman said that officials refer to Columbia/HCA as ""largest health care fraud"" rather than the more narrow term ""Medicare fraud"" because it involved defrauding other government programs such as Medicaid rather than Medicare exclusively. The Justice Department described in detail the various ways the company defrauded Medicare and other government health programs here.

Here’s a key point, though: While the Columbia/HCA settlement was a record at the time for health care fraud, it has since been surpassed. In cases related to the improper promotion of certain drugs, Johnson & Johnson agreed to a a $2.2 billion settlement in 2013, Pfizer settled for $2.3 billion in 2009, and GlaxoSmithKline settled for $3 billion in 2012.

""HCA was the record health care fraud at the time. It’s now Glaxo,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Linda Mansour told PolitiFact in an email.

That said, these cases were a little different. While the Justice Department’s case against Columbia/HCA repeatedly mentions overbilling and defrauding Medicare and Medicaid specifically, the three newer cases focused on the marketing of drugs, with Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs caught up in the impropriety, rather than being the specific targets of the fraud.

Because the Justice Department press releases explaining the settlements don’t explicitly break down how much of the misconduct in those more recent cases defrauded Medicare explicitly, it’s difficult to make comparisons.

The Pfizer case includes violations relating to misbranding and kickbacks, ""so there may be a distinction to be made for that reason when thinking about whether it all should be classified under the very general category of ‘Medicare fraud,’ "" said Asha Scielzo, who practices health care law at the firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.

The Columbia/HCA case ""still is the largest fraud settlement for a hospital corporation in U. S. history,"" since all the others involved pharmaceutical firms, added Zack Buck, a health care law professor at Mercer. ""So I guess, the quote (by the Florida Democratic Party) is a little loose.""

The Scott campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check. However in 2010, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times, ""There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader.""

The Florida Democratic Party said Scott ""oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history.""

The Columbia/HCA settlement has since been surpassed in dollar value, though the bigger cases involved Medicare somewhat less directly. Because the Democratic Party could have been a bit more specific in its wording -- by saying that Scott oversaw the largest Medicare fraud at the time -- we rate the claim Mostly True.

187,1,,"Bernie Sanders is weighing a 2020 presidential run, traveling the country and showing that the lefty, populist fervor that made him a surprisingly strong challenger to Hillary Clinton hasn’t gone away. In the meantime, the Democrats are gaining momentum toward retaking Congress in the 2018 midterms. What’s interesting is that the two trends don’t seem to be intersecting: so far, the blue wave isn’t a Bernie wave.

In rural western Pennsylvania, Conor Lamb won a narrow special-election upset in a heavily Republican district by running a largely centrist campaign: in favor of fracking, not in favor of single-payer health care. In suburban Chicago, incumbent Dan Lipinski, a throwback Blue Dog Democrat—anti-abortion, anti-Obamacare—won a primary in a reliably liberal district by defeating a Sanders-endorsed progressive challenger, Marie Newman. And while dozens of Sanders-inspired candidates are on Democratic primary ballots this fall, their chances generally don’t appear a whole lot better. The reasons are as varied as the 435 congressional districts, but one consistent hurdle appears to be unchanged from the 2016 Sanders-Clinton presidential battle, despite provoking so much controversy: state parties, and the Democratic National Committee, are weighted in favor of entrenched candidates and traditional big-money interest groups.

“For Tom Perez to be a disappointment as the new leader of the D. N.C., I would have had to have high expectations,” says Corbin Trent, a former Sanders operative who is now communications director for Justice Democrats, one of the most prominent groups launched in the wake of the 2016 election to try to elect progressive Democrats. “When we have a Democratic Party that won’t stand behind candidates with a huge capacity to generate grassroots donations and activity, they’re not interested in letting the democratic process shake out.”

Trent points to the state of Washington as one midterm example. East of Seattle, a seven-term Republican congressman is retiring, generating an eight-way scramble for the Democratic nomination. The early favorite, Kim Schrier, has been fending off complaints from her rivals on the left that the state party is trying to clear the field on her behalf. Two candidates backed by Justice Democrats in other Washington districts, Dorothy Gasque and Sarah Smith, have run up against bureaucratic obstacles. “The state parties are still working to put their thumb on the scales in something as basic as voter file access,” Trent says. “I had hoped that one of the lessons of 2016, especially with the D. N.C., would be that a fair fight is in everybody’s best interest. But that doesn’t seem to be the case.” (The head of the Washington State Democratic Party has said she’s staying neutral. “The D.N.C. does not get involved in congressional primaries, and the state parties operate according to their own bylaws,” a D.N.C. spokeswoman says.)

Nina Turner, the head of Our Revolution, the Sanders-founded political group, is more worried that Democrats are once again selling their ideological soul in the name of racking up political victories, and will end up repeating the same lack of enthusiasm for their candidates that helped elect Donald Trump. “People say Lamb and Lipinski show that progressives can’t win. Lee Carter, in a strong Virginia Republican state legislative district, didn’t run in the middle—he won as a democratic socialist! Randall Woodfin, in Birmingham, Alabama, ran as a progressive and won the mayor’s race!” Turner says. “I was in Flint, Michigan, last night with Senator Sanders, and the reality on the ground is very much reflective of the town hall he did. Running to the middle does nothing to help the people in Flint. Playing to the middle is not what excites people and gets them out to vote, and it is not what changes the status quo in real people’s lives.”

At the moment, however, fear and hatred of Trump seem to be motivation enough to elect Democrats in many midterm races. And Bernie Dems still haven’t broken through in many contests where they need to appeal across more diverse geographic and demographic terrain; Sanders himself is now trying to fix his glaring weakness with black voters. “The Bernie crowd went all in against Ralph Northam last year in the Virginia governor Democratic primary—and lost,” says Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat. “And Northam, the more centrist candidate, went on to victory in the general in November, so it’s obvious the Democrats chose the most appropriate candidate. The progressive agenda should absolutely be respected as important to the future of our nation. But it remains to be seen how potent a force the left will be in primarying Democrats. And I think we’re close to being able to say that the swing to the left has been overhyped and is not electorally effective.”

But even in face of public outcries, the gun rights group just proved that it remains staunch in its defense of the right to own semi-automatic weapons: The NRA is now attempting to justify the sale of AR-15s by developing genetically modified deer that can only be hunted with assault rifles.

There’s no question about it—the NRA is not backing down.

According to figures released this morning, the NRA has invested more than $150 million to alter common deer into terrifying behemoths with titanium fangs and hides thicker than Kevlar in order to rationalize why Americans need AR-15s. When the forests are being stalked by these 7-foot-tall mutants with legs powerful enough to ram through bank vault doors, the NRA is betting that even gun control advocates will concede that everyone will need a gun that can shoot up to 400 rounds per minute to try and slow these unholy abominations down.

“It is the constitutional right of each American to own an AR-15, which is one of the few guns capable of killing the ruthless and nearly indestructible deer we are currently developing,” said Dana Loesch, spokeswoman for the NRA. “A proud gun owner who goes hunting with his family won’t have time for a bolt-action rifle if an unstoppable lab-grown beast charges him with its razor-sharp metal antlers, so we’re urging all Americans to get their assault rifles now.”

“Anyone still trying to ban the AR-15 is basically begging to have their face melted off by the mutant deers’ venom saliva spray,” Loesch added.

Wow. Because of the ferocious deer mutants soon to be roaming the countryside, recreational hunting could now warrant using weapons that were originally intended only for a battlefield. It looks like the NRA isn’t letting up on the fight for gun rights anytime soon.

202,1,1.0,"* President Donald Trump reportedly questioned why the CIA had waited for a drone strike target to walk away from his family before killing him.

* Trump had previously advocated taking out the families of terrorists during his presidential campaign.

* He has also spoken in favor of using large-scale military power to target enemies in Syria and Afghanistan.

President Donald Trump was reportedly unhappy with the CIA's apparent desire to minimize civilian casualties when carrying out drone strikes, according to a Washington Post source who was in a meeting with Trump and agency officials.

On his first full day in office in January 2017, the CIA was reportedly showing Trump a recording of a previous drone strike in which operators had waited to strike at the target until he wandered away from his home, which had his family inside. But Trump questioned the move, according to The Washington Post's source.

“Why did you wait?” the person at the meeting recalled Trump saying.

Trump was also reportedly not impressed by new CIA military capabilities that allowed them to limit civilian casualties, sources noted. He commanded the CIA to begin arming its drones in Syria, where the agency had largely been flying surveillance missions and leaving strikes up to the US military.

This wasn't the first time Trump had expressed a disregard for civilian deaths in war zones — on the campaign trail in December 2015, Trump expressed a similar sentiment on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We're fighting a very politically correct war,"" Trump said. ""When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself.""

Trump has advocated the use of overwhelming force against terrorist groups like ISIS in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere.

In April 2017, Trump gave the Pentagon a free hand to use the Mother of All Bombs (MOAB), the largest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal, to strike at a cave complex inhabited by ISIS fighters in Afghanistan.

""We have given them total authorization and that's what they're doing and frankly that's why they've been so successful lately,"" the president said at the time. ""If you look at what's happened over the last eight weeks and compare that really to what's happened over the past eight years, you'll see there's a tremendous difference, tremendous difference.""

The explosion produced a mushroom cloud five miles high, and was visible for miles around.

203,1,0.0,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc faced new calls for regulation from within U. S. Congress and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards on Saturday after reports a political consultant gained inappropriate access to 50 million users’ data starting in 2014.

Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it.

The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U. S. elections.

“They say ‘trust us.’ Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,” she added, referring to Facebook’s CEO and a committee she sits on.

Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation.

Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers.

“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data.

Pasquale said Facebook’s response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users.

“It amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that’s all they have left,” he said.

Democratic U. S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West.”

“Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.

With Republicans controlling the Senate’s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.

The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015.

Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.

Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.

Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.

Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.

Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. “We must do better and will,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that “our business depends on it at every level.”

Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.

Nuala O’Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D. C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.

Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. “That’s a long time,” she said.

Britain’s data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.

“It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey’s office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are.

204,1,,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Friday called on Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt to resign, saying he has ""displayed a staggering ethical blindness.""

“EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s tenure has been a part of the Trump Administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence. Pruitt must resign,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Pruitt has displayed a staggering ethical blindness, and his abuses of office are representative of an Administration that uses their powerful positions to enrich themselves and their friends.""

Pruitt has been the subject of a series of damaging articles in recent days alleging that he rented a $50-a-night condo room from a pair of lobbyists, that he reportedly sidelined aides who questioned his expensive travel and security costs, and that he allegedly asked for sirens and lights to speed up his trips around Washington, including to a trendy French restaurant.

He is also being investigated by the EPA's inspector general for other purported ethical lapses involving his travel and security expenses.

Even though White House officials have been irritated by the scandals, President Donald Trump has continued to publicly voice support for the EPA chief.

207,1,,"For the second time in less than a month, Tennessee's GOP state lawmakers have declined to proceed on legislation condemning white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups. On Monday, roughly three weeks after a Democratic-sponsored resolution died in committee, GOP state Rep. Ryan Williams quietly requested that the Republican version of the measure be withdrawn.

The new version was nearly identical to the one put forth by Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons in the days immediately following the white nationalist rally last August in Charlottesville, Va. After those demonstrations descended into deadly violence, Clemmons' brief resolution stated that ""we strongly denounce and oppose"" the beliefs underpinning white nationalism — and urged law enforcement to recognize these and neo-Nazi groups as terrorist organizations.

That measure met its end before it could pass the State Government Subcommittee, having failed to receive any Republican support. GOP lawmakers in the committee initially offered no explanation why, but they later described the resolution as a trap designed to embarrass them, rather than actually win passage.

""Part of being a great legislator is knowing your bill, knowing the committee that it's going through, working the vote and asking for a motion and a second before you get there,"" Williams said then, according to Nashville Public Radio. ""That's what policymaking is. It's pretty simple.""

House Majority Leader Glen Casada told the member station that if Clemmons should try again, the GOP caucus would ""definitely second it, motion it, support it, vote for it"" — an assertion Clemmons responded to with blunt disbelief.

""Glen Casada is full of crap,"" Clemmons told Nashville Public Radio in an email. ""Feel free to quote me.""

Yet the resolution did indeed appear destined for revival last week after Williams, who serves as the House Republican caucus chairman, introduced a second resolution identical to the first in every respect except one: It dropped the stipulation urging the designation of neo-Nazis and white nationalists as domestic terrorists.

That revival lasted less than a week, though. The resolution was withdrawn from a committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday, by Williams' own request.

His office did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

But in a statement given to The Tennessean, Williams explained that the ""bill's caption was too narrow and couldn't be amended to incorporate additional feedback gathered from our members over the past couple of days."" The newspaper noted that he did not clarify what, exactly, that additional feedback would have entailed.

""I still believe it is important for our General Assembly to condemn groups that support racism and hatred,"" Williams said. ""I look forward to working with members on both sides of the aisle on a future resolution which can meet the expectations of all of our House members, as well as the citizens of Tennessee.""

210,5,1.0,"President Trump signed a proclamation Wednesday night to send the National Guard to the southern border immediately, a senior White House official told Fox News, in response to what the administration described as an ""unacceptable"" flow of drugs, criminal activity and illegal immigrants.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said at the White House press briefing that the signing would be done in conjunction with governors and that the administration hoped the deployment would begin ""immediately.""

""Despite a number of steps this administration has taken...we continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs, dangerous gang activity transnational criminal organizations and illegal immigration flow across our border,"" she said.

""The president has directed that the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security work together with our governors to deploy our National Guard to our southwest border  to assist the border patrol,"" she said. ""The president will be signing a proclamation to that effect today.""

Details about what the National Guard would do and how many would be deployed and for how long were not immediately disclosed.

Under the George W. Bush administration, deploying the National Guard to the border cost $415 million dollars.

Nielsen pointed to what she described as increasing fraud and exploited loopholes among arrivals on the southern border, saying traffickers have been advertising that if migrants have children with them, then they are more likely to be released into the U. S. She also said that almost 50 percent of arriving aliens are from Central America.

""Traffickers and smugglers know that these individuals cannot under U. S. law be easily removed in an expeditious way back to their country of origin and so they exploit the loophole,"" she said, adding that the ability to game the system acts as a magnet for more migrants.

She said that the administration has drafted legislation and will ask Congress to provide legal authority and resources to address the problem.

""We will not allow illegal immigration levels to become the norm,"" she said. ""More than 1,000 people a day, 300,000 a year violating our sovereignty as a nation will never be acceptable to this president.""

Trump had tweeted earlier Wednesday that he would “be taking strong action today” on the Mexico border, a day after he said that he wants to send the military to secure it until a wall is built.

Arguing that the U. S. border laws “are very weak” compared to Mexico and Canada, he accused Democrats of wanting immigrants “to pour into our country unchecked.”

Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had deployed the National Guard to the border in response to security issues.

The Associated Press reported that the White House was considering a model similar to a Bush-era operation, where in 2006 6,000 National Guard troops were sent to assist the border patrol with non-law enforcement duties while additional border agents were hired and trained.

Trump's recent focus on illegal immigration appeared to have been partly motivated by a caravan of more than 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the U. S. border.

Trump had threatened to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to cut foreign aid to countries such as Honduras, from where many of the migrants originate, if the caravan was not stopped.

Trump said Tuesday that he believes the caravan is being broken up after he had a conversation with Mexican officials.

Nielsen said on Tuesday that she had been advised by Mexican officials that “the caravan is dissipating” and that several hundred migrants had been repatriated.

“We will not accept the lawlessness of these types of efforts and those who choose to violate our laws, and those who conspire to assist others to violate our laws, will face criminal prosecution,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. “The Department of Justice fully supports the efforts of the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security announced today to secure our border. I will soon be announcing additional Department of Justice initiatives to restore legality to the southern border.”

Trump’s Most Influential White Nationalist Troll Is A Middlebury Grad Who Lives In Manhattan

Twitter troll “Ricky Vaughn” had a bigger influence on the 2016 election than NBC News and the Drudge Report. Here's who he really is.

Who is Ricky Vaughn? That was one of the big questions for anyone following far-right politics during the 2016 presidential election. The Twitter troll who took his name and avatar from Charlie Sheen’s character in “Major League” was everywhere on social media, an indefatigable circulator of edgy memes and rah-rah Donald Trump boosterism.

There was no mistaking Ricky Vaughn’s influence. He had tens of thousands of followers, and his talent for blending far-right propaganda with conservative messages on Twitter made him a key disseminator of extremist views to Republican voters and a central figure in the “alt-right” white supremacist movement that attached itself to Trump’s coattails. The MIT Media Lab named him to its list of top 150 influencers on the election, based on news appearances and social media impact. He finished ahead of NBC News, Drudge Report and Stephen Colbert. Mainstream conservatives didn’t know they were retweeting an avowed racist and anti-Semite, but they liked what Ricky Vaughn had to say.

“He did this thing that people connected to organized white nationalism have not been able to do ― walk both sides of the extremist line in the sand,” said Keegan Hankes, a data intelligence expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Ricky Vaughn also played an important role in amplifying disinformation injected into American politics by the Russian government. HuffPost and a team of data scientists known as Susan Bourbaki Anthony that tracks online propaganda analyzed who was retweeting the now infamous Kremlin-controlled Twitter account @TEN_GOP, which consistently praised Trump, attacked Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and churned out a vile medley of racism, Islamophobia and “fake news.”

In the data set of significant accounts we looked at, Ricky Vaughn retweeted @TEN_GOP the most, by far. Although Twitter shut down his @Ricky_Vaughn99 handle in October 2016, another handle he used, @RapinBill, took over and retweeted @TEN_GOP at least 162 times between early March and late August 2017. (@RapinBill also retweeted @Pamela_Moore13, another Kremlin-controlled account, at least 37 times during this period.)

Curiously, @RapinBill, which is still active and followed by Donald Trump Jr., does not appear to have received a single reciprocal retweet from @TEN_GOP in this time period, perhaps indicating an attempt to conceal the connection. @RapinBill retweeted @TEN_GOP until the end. When Twitter finally shut down @TEN_GOP last August, after having ignored numerous complaints about the Russian account, Ricky Vaughn did not take it well. He groused that @TEN_GOP had been “banned for supporting our president.” Within hours, he was steering traffic to the Kremlin’s backup account:

Ricky Vaughn was able to remain anonymous ― until this week.

On Monday, white nationalist Republican candidate Paul Nehlen, who is running against House Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin, grew upset about criticism directed at him ― and seemingly not disavowed by Ricky Vaughn ― as the alt-right fragments under the weight of infighting, lawsuits and anti-fascist opposition. Two main camps have emerged: the real-world extremists who want to continue holding rallies and mixing it up in the streets, and the “optics cucks” who think the best approach to the mainstream is to keep pushing alt-right ideas through better propaganda. Ricky Vaughn is in the latter camp. And he hasn’t been shy about it.

“I’m dividing the movement between effective people and dumb losers,” he wrote on Gab, a social media platform overrun by white supremacists.

Amid all this infighting, an angry Nehlen dropped Ricky Vaughn’s real name:

Douglass Mackey with two unidentified women at an event from his now-deactivated Couchsurfing account.

The name ― with the double-s ― checked out. So did many other details. In October, I’d spoken with Loren Feldman, a filmmaker in Los Angeles who interviewed “Ricky Vaughn” in 2016 for a documentary project. Feldman agreed not to show the far-right troll’s face on camera and never learned his full name. But Ricky Vaughn, whom Feldman described to me as a nervous, slightly built blond man in his mid- to late 20s, had introduced himself as “Doug.” He told Feldman that he was from New England and had gone to a private school and worked in “consulting or finance” in New York. He was smart and well-heeled, an urbane cosmopolitan elite. “You would never ever in a million years think that was Ricky Vaughn,” Feldman said.

On Monday, I sent photos I’d found of Douglass Mackey online to Feldman. I did not mention Mackey’s name or any identifying details. I simply asked Feldman if he recognized the man.

Douglass Mackey, left, in a photo from his former Couchsurfing account.

On Tuesday, Christopher Cantwell, another white nationalist who is feuding with Ricky Vaughn, posted a more recent photo of the propagandist to Gab that wasn’t readily available online. It appeared to be an older, heavier Mackey.

“Several photos have been showing up in several different mediums by which I communicate with my audience,” Cantwell said. “I don’t remember who gave it to me, but it matched the face I’ve seen in several other photos purporting to be him. I know people who have met Doug, and nobody who knows him has bothered to correct me, so I’m operating under the assumption that it’s authentic.”

The voice checked out too. Ricky Vaughn has done numerous white supremacist podcasts, and his calm, distinctive voice was identical to the voice of “Doug” that Feldman recorded for his film and to which I listened. A former colleague of Mackey’s who listened to one of Ricky Vaughn’s podcasts also deemed the voices a match. “That does sound like Doug,” he told me. I asked him how certain he was. “I don’t think you’re wrong,” he said. “It’s him.”

Another source, one who worked for the Trump campaign and is friendly with Ricky Vaughn, told me on Monday that the troll was desperately trying to get Andrew Torba, the CEO of Gab, to remove the information about him that Nehlen had posted. All of which would seem to further confirm Ricky Vaughn’s identity as Douglass Mackey.

So who is Doug Mackey?

The 28-year-old has done a good job keeping information about himself off the internet. Either before or immediately after Nehlen published his name, Mackey, who did not respond to requests to comment, removed all his personal social media accounts, traces of which remain online. But here’s what we know so far. (We will update the story as more information becomes available.)

Mackey is from Waterbury, Vermont, a small town of around 5,000 people in the middle of the state. His father, Scott, a lobbyist who focuses on tax policy affecting wireless communications and the digital economy, was a former legislative aide to the late U. S. Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.). When contacted by email, Scott told HuffPost that “this is a very difficult time for our family and I don’t have any comment.”

His mother, Kathleen, whom HuffPost reached by phone, also declined to speak about her son. “I don’t have anything to say at this time,” she said.

Mackey’s education is easier to trace. He went to Harwood Union High School, then nearby Middlebury College, where he competed on the track and field team for one season, running mainly the 800-meter distance. He graduated in 2011 with an economics degree.

After college, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, and took a job as an economist at John Dunham & Associates, an economic consulting firm that uses data to help clients “respond to threats and opportunities in the policy arena.” When reached by phone on Wednesday, the president of the company, John Dunham, confirmed that Mackey had been an employee there from April 2012 to July 2016, when he was terminated for reasons that Dunham could not reveal under New York labor laws. (A month earlier, the @RapinBill Twitter account was registered.)

Mackey appears to have moved that year into a two-bedroom apartment on Lexington Avenue in the Carnegie Hill neighborhood on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. That was certainly his residence by the time he voted, as a Republican, in the 2016 election, according to New York voter registration information.

By then, his apparent alter ego Ricky Vaughn had become a mighty pusher of propaganda, teaming up with other far-right operatives, such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec, to spread racist lies and dangerous conspiracy theories.

Ricky Vaughn had also by then gone public with the history of his political metamorphosis into a white nationalist, which began, as it did for many members of the alt-right around his age, with Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Paul’s conspiratorial libertarianism and racist ideas were attractive to many young white men with hard-right leanings. For some, though, Paul wasn’t radical enough. He was merely a gateway.

As Ricky Vaughn has explained in various podcasts and interviews for white nationalist platforms, after about three years of toying with libertarian ideas, he started growing more extreme. First, he became a critic of feminism. Then he went full racist “after the Trayvon Martin thing” in 2012 (when George Zimmerman fatally shot Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in Florida). “Why were they trying to make this racial narrative?” Ricky Vaughn told white nationalist Richard Spencer in a podcast. He elaborated in a separate interview on the website for Spencer’s Radix Journal:

At that time I realized what a con job the media was playing on all of us, and how the mainstream race propaganda was all bullshit. So from there I began to explore the different facets of cultural Marxism. The Jewish role in subversion, homosexuality, et cetera.

During Gamergate, a 2014 online harassment campaign waged by misogynists and racists online against women and minorities in the video game industry, Ricky Vaughn linked up with Yiannopoulos and Cernovich, who were ringleaders in the harassment and would both go on to even greater notoriety with their attempts to contaminate American political discourse with conspiracy theories.

“I owe a lot to them,” Ricky Vaughn said on a recent podcast.

By the beginning of 2016, he was clearly an open “alt-right” white nationalist. He talked about how “the good people are siding with nationalism and the Shabbos goyim shills and the neocohens are siding with the globalists.” He talked about how he wanted to “introduce ideas of racial consciousness into the mix so that patriotic American conservatives don’t feel bad about creating all-White communities and shunning mixed-marriages and that sort of thing, because we need racial separatism in order to maintain our unique culture and racial heritage.”

Although Ricky Vaughn would later try to distance himself from white supremacy ― one reason it was easy for some neo-Nazis to celebrate his doxing this week ― he never could. “I still call myself alt-right,” he said on a recent podcast.

He still engaged in the trolling and harassment that conveys status within the far-right. After the mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school in February, Ricky Vaughn, true to form, used another one of his Twitter accounts to attack Cameron Kasky, one of the survivors, after Kasky advocated for gun control. In a tweet that he has since deleted, he wrote:

“You’re a crass, craven, disgusting worm. Smiling and laughing and taking selfies in the wake of a massacre. Why? Because you’ve punched your ticket now. You’re famous, just like you always wanted to be. A little theatre whore. Dance for the cameras, monkey.”

But his desire ― or need ― to be all things to all racists no longer worked. The opportunism that gave him mass appeal when the far-right was unified during the Trump campaign and for several months after the election also spelled his doom after last summer’s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The deadly rally was a disaster for the alt-right. The infighting began soon after. And Ricky Vaughn was a target.

“That same strategy of one foot in the mainstream camp and one foot in the white nationalist camp didn’t hold up after Charlottesville,” Hankes from the SPLC said. “You saw him getting attacked pretty viciously by the hard right in the post-Charlottesville moment where a large part of the alt-right was black-pilled (i.e. soured) on Trump. That mainstream strategy kind of crumbled and ruined his credibility.”

He was too soft, many other white nationalists said. Too much of a sellout. Many denounced him. But Ricky Vaughn kept fighting for relevance. A month ago, in the debut of his own “Ricky Vaughncast” podcast, he described his new approach, which was softer even still. He felt the alt-right should move away from trying to publicly convert people to white nationalism with brute-force propaganda and instead seduce them secretly in private.

“I view it strictly from the standpoint of what’s effective,” he said.

Secrecy will no longer be effective for Ricky Vaughn.

215,1,,"As the final weeks of the 2016 elections ticked down, voters in swing states like Nevada and North Carolina began seeing eerie promotional travel ads as they scrolled through their Facebook feeds or clicked through Google sites.

In one, a woman with a French accent cheerfully welcomes visitors to the “Islamic State of France,” where “under Sharia law,  you can enjoy everything the Islamic State of France has to offer, as long as you follow the rules.”

The video has a Man in the High Tower feel. Iconic French tourist sites are both familiar and transformed — the Eiffel Tower is capped with a star and crescent and the spires of the Notre Dame are replaced with the domed qubba of a mosque.

The Mona Lisa is shown looking, the ad says, “as a woman should,” covered in a burka.

If it wasn’t already clear that the ad was meant to stoke viewers’ fears of imminent Muslim conquest, the video is interspersed with violent imagery. Three missiles are seen flying through the sky as the video opens. Blindfolded men are shown kneeling with guns pointed at their heads, and children are shown training with weapons “to defend the caliphate.”

This is one of three mock travel ads.

Another, for the “Islamic State of Germany,” invited visitors to “celebrate the arranged marriages of future jihadi soldiers” at a pork- and alcohol-free Oktoberfest.

“You can even sell your daughter or sister to be married,” the ad notes enthusiastically while showing the covered face of a woman wearing a black burka.

And just to bring it all home, days before the election, the group made an “Islamic States of America“ travel promo, where Syrian refugees have overtaken America. In the ad, the iconic Hollywood sign reads “Allahu Akbar,” and the Statue of Liberty wears a burka and holds a star and crescent. In the video, the 9/11 Memorial in New York City is celebrated as an Islamic victory.

Most Americans have never heard of the far-right neoconservative nonprofit that ran the ads. It has no employees and no volunteers, and it’s run out of the offices of a Washington, D. C. law firm. More importantly, most voters never saw the ads.

And that was by design.

The group, a social welfare organization called Secure America Now, worked hand in hand with Facebook and Google to target their message at voters in swing states who were most likely to be receptive to them.

And new tax documents obtained by OpenSecrets show that the money fueling the group came mostly from just three donors, including the secretive multimillionaire donor Robert Mercer.

As a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, Secure America Now (SAN) is not required to disclose its donors to the public, but they are required to report them to the IRS. This information is usually redacted when provided for public inspection. However, when OpenSecrets called to request a 2016 return, an unredacted return was provided by the group’s accounting firm.

The filing shows the largest individual contribution, $2 million, came from Robert Mercer, the reclusive hedge fund investor who spent millions in 2016 helping Donald Trump capture the White House.

Mercer has become a household name not only for his political spending in recent years or his peculiar interests — such as part-timing as a New Mexico police officer or funding stockpiles of urine in the Oregon mountains — but also for bankrolling the alt-right and the data firm Cambridge Analytica, both of which helped Trump clutch victory in 2016.

As OpenSecrets reported last month, SAN received another $2 million from the 45Committee, another pro-Trump dark money group, which is itself partly funded by other dark money groups.

Ronald S. Lauder, the heir to the Estee Lauder fortune, gave $1.1 million. Lauder has long been a supporter of conservative and pro-Israel causes, and his longtime political adviser Allen Roth serves as president of Secure America Now.

The remaining $60,000 in reported contributions came from three donors: Brad Anderson, the former CEO of Best Buy; Foster Friess, the investor and longtime Republican donor; and Olympus Ventures LLC, which is tied to a foundation created by Dick Schulze, the founder of Best Buy.

Social welfare organizations like Secure America Now are not supposed to have politics as their primary purpose, but a combination of vague rules and ineffective oversight make it easy for such groups to spend heavily in elections, without being required to disclose their donors.

SAN reported more than $1 million in political spending to the Federal Election Commission in 2016 — in the form of “independent expenditures,” which means they appealed directly to voters, asking them to support or oppose specific candidates for office.

While there are some differences between what the FEC and the IRS consider political spending, such direct calls for voters to support or oppose candidates are generally considered to be unambiguously political. Yet, in filing their tax returns, SAN told the IRS it only spent $124,192 on politics.

It’s hard to discern where this discrepancy stems from. Marc Owens, a tax lawyer who used to head the IRS Exempt Organizations Division, pointed out in an email to OpenSecrets that the “IRS ‘facts and circumstances’ standard has always been considered to sweep in more activity/expenditures than the FEC ‘independent expenditure’ standard.”

Yet, the IRS isn’t likely to catch the discrepancy on its own. The agency does not systematically analyze FEC reported political spending to catch discrepancies in what groups report on their tax returns. And only seven out of every 1,000 tax returns are audited by the agency, and even then the IRS is not always scrutinizing a group’s political activity.

Even with $1 million in political spending, SAN would find itself well below the threshold for excessive political activity — which, absent specific bright lines from the IRS, is generally assumed to be less than half of a group’s overall spending.

But the only way for the IRS to truly conclude that a group like SAN engaged in too much campaign intervention is to conduct a “facts and circumstances” analysis of the group’s finances. And that’s why those parody travel promotions are so important.

The Islamic State ads offer an interesting test of areas where the IRS definition of campaign intervention might be more expansive than what election law defines as political, even though they don’t mention a candidate. As a Congressional Research Service report noted in 2012, “the standard for determining whether something is campaign activity under the IRC is whether it exhibits a preference for or against a candidate” — not, that is, whether the candidate is actually mentioned.

“Preference can be subtle,” the report notes, “and the IRS takes the position that it is not always necessary to expressly mention a candidate by name.”

So, the fact that SAN didn’t expressly mention candidates in its ads does not mean that they were not political. And facts that have been reported since the election suggest that there is plenty of evidence supporting the conclusion that SAN’s digital ads were aimed at influencing the election.

For one, as Bloomberg reported last October, internal reports from the ad agency that ran SAN’s digital campaign, and individuals who were involved with the effort, showed that SAN worked with Google and Facebook to target the ads at swing-state voters.

“Facebook advertising salespeople, creative advisers and technical experts competed with sales staff from Alphabet Inc.’s Google for millions in ad dollars from Secure America Now,” the Bloomberg report writes.

The ads weren’t targeted broadly at the American public, but at Americans who would be mostly likely to decide the winners in critical senate races and the campaign for the White House.

Other ads in the campaign highlight this aim. For example, other digital ads run by SAN targeted specific candidates.

“STOP SUPPORT OF TERRORISM. VOTE AGAINST CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO,” read one ad, referencing the Democratic candidate for Nevada’s open senate seat.

The ads “were viewed millions of times on Facebook and Google,” Bloomberg wrote, citing internal documents. And Facebook went so far as to use Secure America Now as a test case for new technology, sending out 12 different versions of the video to see which was the most popular.

One other reason why the IRS might rule that the ads entail campaign intervention, despite being absent any mention of a candidate, is that the subject of Muslim’s entering the country was what Owens refers to as “an issue distinguishing the candidates for a given office.”

In December 2015, Donald Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The month before, he had referred to Syrian refugees as possibly “one of the great Trojan horses.”

One of the most defining differences between Trump and his opponent was his views on Muslims in general, and Muslim refugees in particular. SAN’s ads were likely trying to exploit that difference when they targeted swing voters, with Google and Facebook’s help.

The tax filing itself offers little insight into how much these campaigns actually cost, beyond the “millions” cited by Bloomberg. Large portions of the group’s spending are a black hole. More than $7.4 million in the SAN’s spending — 87 percent of their overall outlays — went towards “membership educational devlp” and “direct mail educational prgm,” which aren’t defined or detailed anywhere in the filing.

Secure America Now representatives did not respond to any of the questions OpenSecrets sent, other than to confirm receipt of the questions.

Neither the IRS nor the FEC are likely to look into SAN’s activities any time soon, if at all, so the group will continue to play a role in public life.

A recent New York Times report detailing internal emails between top Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a political adviser to leaders in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia noted that Broidy referenced SAN as “one of the groups I am working with” to push the Trump administration to fill key positions with individuals favorable to those Persian Gulf leaders.

220,1,0.0,"O dia 4 de abril ganhou ares de excepcionalidade depois que o Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) determinou que nesta data seria julgada a liberdade do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula nos próximos meses. Provocados pela defesa do petista, caberia aos 11 ministros decidir se ele deveria começar a cumprir em breve a pena de 12 anos e 1 mês estabelecida em segunda instância no processo do tríplex do Guarujá (SP) ou se poderia esgotar recursos judiciários longe da cadeia.

Em jogo, não estava apenas a definição sobre se Lula passaria a dormir e acordar em uma cela de algum presídio do país. Primeiro colocado nas pesquisas de intenção de voto para eleição presidencial de 2018, Lula pretendia ser o principal cabo eleitoral de si mesmo ou do candidato do PT ao pleito, correndo o Brasil para propagandear sua agenda e tentar retomar controle do Palácio do Planalto em 2018.

A importância da decisão para o futuro político movimentou milhares de pessoas às ruas de diversas cidades para se manifestar contra ou a favor do petista. Enquanto isso, Lula optou por voltar para o ponto de onde se projetou nacionalmente. No Sindicato dos Metalúrgicos do ABC, ao lado de velhos e novos amigos, ele viveu cada uma das mais de 10 horas do julgamento do Brasília.

A BBC Brasil conta como ele passou por elas:

11h25 - Cercado por seguranças, Lula chega ao Sindicato dos Metalúrgicos de São Bernardo do Campo - de onde decidiu, na última terça, acompanhar a sessão do Supremo Tribunal Federal. Sobe discretamente para o segundo andar, sem cumprimentar a militância de cerca de 400 pessoas, que aguardava desde as 10h da manhã no salão principal da entidade, bandeiras vermelhas em punho. O salão foi especialmente decorado com fotos históricas de Lula para a ocasião. As janelas dos corredores do segundo andar do sindicato, onde Lula vai assistir ao julgamento, foram forrados com tecidos, para esconder os movimentos do petista. Durante a manhã, Lula recebeu antigos líderes sindicais, como Djalma Bom e Expedito Soares, que entregam uma carta de apoio ao ex-presidente. Ele relembrou as greves que participou durante a ditadura militar.

12h20 - Enquanto Lula conversa a portas fechadas com Luiz Marinho, pré-candidato do PT ao governo paulista, uma banda embala a militância: ""Eeeee, ooo, vida de gado, povo marcado, povo feliz."" A ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff chega ao sindicato acompanhada do ex-ministro Miguel Rossetto e se junta ao padrinho.

Lideranças do partido insistem no discurso de que o PT não trabalharia com a hipótese de prisão de Lula. ""Temos a confiança de que o Supremo vai ser o guardião da Constituição"", diz Marinho, que saiu da sala para cumprimentar militantes no salão.  ""Eles cometeram um erro em 2016 (quando autorizaram a prisão após segunda instância). Agora é a chance de corrigir"", diz, enquanto se prepara para tirar uma foto com duas crianças.

""Temos plena convicção de que o habeas corpus será acatado. Se não for, seguimos com a caravana"", diz o ex-ministro Carlos Gabas.

13h - Um almoço - arroz, feijão e bife - é servido ao ex-presidente Lula e sua comitiva - Dilma, Marinho, os governadores Tião Viana e Wellington Dias, além de Gabas e Miguel Rossetto. Parte dos militantes almoça no restaurante do sindicato, no último andar, enquanto outra parte - composta, sobretudo, por pequenos agricultores - entoa um batuque sentada no salão.

13h40 - Pouco antes da sessão começar aliados do ex-presidente dizem que ele está tão tranquilo que encontra tempo para comentar o gol de Cristiano Ronaldo no jogo da Liga dos Campeões, na noite de terça. Sem revelar tensão com o julgamento, Lula teria demonstrado preocupação apenas com o comentário do comandante do Exército, general Eduardo Villas Bôas, que na noite de terça-feira postou mensagens em que dizia ser contrário ""à impunidade"", em ato que foi interpretado por políticos e analistas como um constrangimento ao STF.

14h07- O STF atrasa sete minutos o início da sessão. A presidente Carmén Lúcia inicia o julgamento com um comentário de menos de dois minutos e às 14:10h, o relator Edson Facchin já falava.

Enquanto isso, o grupo de aliados e o próprio Lula ainda almoçavam. O ex-prefeito Fernando Haddad e o governador de Minas Gerais Fernando Pimentel tinham se juntado ao grupo um pouco antes. A mulher do presidenciável do PSOL Guilherme Boulos, Natália, também veio acompanhar o julgamento com Lula. Boulos, em viagem, não pode comparecer. Da família, está presente o irmão Genival Inácio da Silva, o Vavá.

14h30 - A banda que toca músicas nordestinas para de cantar para a transmissão do julgamento.

""Vim para assistir. Dói de ver, mas é melhor, né? A gente espera que tenha um bom resultado favorável"", diz Antonio Lucivaldo Avelino de Lima, 50, metalúrgico da região do ABC. ""Vai ser uma injustiça"", diz, pessimista. Militantes soltam o coro: ""Lula guerreiro, do povo brasileiro"". ""Assim não dá pra ouvir nada"", reclama um ex-metalúrgico que tentava acompanhar o que diziam os ministros.

""A Rosa Weber vai votar a nosso favor"", avaliava outro ex-operário, Francisco de Assis do Santos, 69, filiado ao PT desde a fundação. ""Se o habeas corpus for negado a gente vai ficar meio desbaratado. Mas não vamos baixar a cabeça"".

15h13 - A lenta leitura dos votos pelos ministros deixa a plateia mais entendiada do que apreensiva. Alguns bocejam. A única reação na primeira hora do julgamento é um muxoxo desaprovador que percorre o salão onde estão os militantes quando Gilmar Mendes critica o PT e o ex-ministro José Dirceu, dizendo que o partido gestou a ""violência que está aí."" Na última semana, ônibus da caravana do ex-presidente foi atingido por tiros, no Paraná. ""Golpista"", grita um militante mais exaltado na plateia, apenas para que o grupo volte a mergulhar num torpor na sequência.

Nem mesmo Lula se mantém vidrado na tela. ""Ele está acompanhando alguns trechos mais importantes. Afinal quem tem paciência?"", comenta um aliado.

15h57 - Em questão de minutos Gilmar Mendes vai de 'golpista' a ovacionado, quando antecipa voto em favor do habeas corpus a Lula. Os militantes pulam e a bateria começa a tocar. ""Lula, presente, eterno presidente"" gritam os manifestantes,  agitando bandeiras de diversos grupos sociais - do Movimento dos Pequenos Agricultores (MPA), do Levante Popular da Juventude e do Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto (MTST).

Quando o julgamento entra em intervalo, o grupo abre uma roda no meio do salão pra declamar poesias. ""Quando os opressores tiverem falado, hão de falar os oprimidos"", diz um, antes de o grupo começar uma encenação de um cabo de guerra do ""povo"" contra o ""poder do capital"".

Na sala onde os líderes petistas assistiam a votação, a posição de Gilmar Mendes contribuiu para avaliação de que o julgamento estava indo bem.""Lula continuou sereno. Ele disse: não vamos comemorar antes do final. Vamos esperar o final"", disse Luiz Marinho, ao circular pelo salão minutos depois.

16h37 - O julgamento recomeça, com o voto do ministro Alexandre de Moraes.

No primeiro andar, filiados do PCO (Partido da Causa Operária) distribuem folhetos em que se lê: ""Sair às ruas contra a prisão de Lula"".

O já esperado voto de Alexandre de Moraes contra o habeas corpus termina sem nenhuma reação dos militantes.

17h30 - Quando o ministro Luis Roberto Barroso sinaliza que votará contra Lula, a maior parte da plateia de militantes está conversando e prestando pouca atenção ao que se passa no Supremo.

Duas amigas discutiam um término de namoro. ""É uma pena, porque você é uma pessoa legal, ele é uma pessoa legal. Pena que não deu certo.""

Depois do voto de Barroso, Lula desiste de assistir ao julgamento. Vai para uma sala onde não há TV e conversa tranquilamente com Dilma, Haddad e outros amigos.

""Ele não parece estar muito interessado nos votos individuais. Quer saber do resultado final"", diz um interlocutor do presidente.

Os dois votos - de Barroso e Alexandre de Moraes-, no entanto, não são surpresa para os petistas . ""Já esperávamos. Esses aí não estavam na conta"", diz uma liderança do partido.

A esperança entre eles está no voto de Rosa Weber, cuja postura ainda era uma incógnita nesse momento.

18h40 - Quando começa o voto de Rosa Weber - decisivo - Lula segue sem mirar a TV. É o quinto voto - de onze - e o ex-presidente está preparado para ficar até tarde no sindicato esperando o final da votação.

No salão, o voto da ministra não está sendo exibido. A militância é reunida no salão e Wagner Santana, presidente do Sindicato dos Metalúrgicos, orienta para que ninguém vá embora e garante que já estão providenciando o jantar para os apoiadores.

""Ao final, vamos precisar de todos vocês aqui. Quer o resultado seja bom ou ruim pra gente"", diz ele, antes de ligarem novamente o telão.

19h10 - Durante fala da ministra Rosa Weber, no entanto, parte dos militantes já vai embora.

19h27 - O voto de Rosa Weber é contrário ao habeas corpus de Lula. A militância ouve em silêncio. Há um clima de confusão. As vaias só vem, esparsas, quando ela diz claramente que acompanha o voto do relator, Fachin. O clima no salão é de desânimo, não de revolta. Mais militantes vão embora.

Lula continua conversando com amigos em uma salinha sem TV. É avisado por vários petistas - que assistiam na sala ao lado - que o voto de Rosa Weber foi contrário a ele.

Diante do cenário, chances do ex-presidente agora são mínimas: entre os ministros que ainda devem votar, pelo menos dois - Luiz Fux e Carmén Lúcia - ja deram indícios de que sua posição é a favor da prisão em segunda instância.

20h20 - Durante a fala do ministro Luiz Fux, contrária ao habeas corpus, uma pizza e uma Coca-Cola são levadas pra o local onde Lula está. O salão onde se concentrava a militância vai se esvaziando - resta menos da metade das pessoas. Um pequeno grupo batuca e gritava alto para atrapalhar os repórteres de TV que tentavam entrar ao vivo.

21h - Amigos próximos de Lula começam a ir embora - entre eles o ex-presidente do PT Rui Falcão e o dirigente do Instituto Lula Paulo Okamotto. Lula continua no sindicato, mas seus assessores anunciaram que ele não iria se pronunciar - nem dar um oi à já escassa militância, nem falar com jornalistas.

22h36 - Diante da derrota de sua posição favorável ao habeas corpus do petista, o ministro Marco Aurélio, nono a votar no plenário do STF, acusa a presidente da Corte, Carmén Lúcia, de ter manobrado a pauta na semana passada, o que acabou resultando na negativa ao pedido de Lula.

Enquanto isso, em São Bernardo do Campo, ninguém entra ou sai da sala onde está Lula. No salão do sindicato, cerca de 50 militantes aguardam em silêncio o fim do julgamento.

23h30 - Faltando apenas dois votos para o fim do julgamento, fogos comemorando a aparente derrota do HC de Lula são soltos em um prédio de apartamentos próximo ao sindicato. Uma motociclista com capacete passa na rua do sindicato gritando ""Lula na cadeia"".

Lula se dirige à garagem e deixa o sindicato de carro, sem falar com ninguém. Um aliado resumiu: ""ele estava tranquilo. É obvio que no foro íntimo é possível que ele tenha ficado abalado, mas não demonstrou"".

Durante a leitura de seu voto sobre o habeas corpus de Lula, o ministro Gilmar Mendes fez a mais dura crítica já proferido por qualquer membro da instituição às tentativas da grande imprensa de influenciar suas decisões.

Gilmar disse que, em mais de quinze anos de casa, jamais viu um publicidade midiática mais opressiva, configurando mesmo chantagem.

O ministro deferiu o habeas corpus pedido pela defesa do presidente. Ou seja, por ele, Lula ficaria livre.

Gilmar foi o segundo a falar. Ele pediu para antecipar seu voto, numa estratégia inteligente para criar um ambiente psicológico propício ao voto de Rosa Weber, cuja personalidade frágil deixava a sua posição em aberto.

O primeiro voto, do relator, o ministro Edson Fachin, foi um primor de cinismo. Ele buscou alguns casos sensacionais de lentidão judicial para defender a prisão automática após condenação em segunda instância, e se posicionou contra o habeas corpus ao presidente Lula.

Além do posicionamento absolutamente desleal com as forças progressistas que lhe indicaram, foi um voto incrivelmente falacioso, porque justificado em nome dos “direitos humanos”. Ou seja, um país com mais de 700 mil presos, e com presídios se constituindo como verdadeiros campos de concentração, com um judiciário plutocrático, conservador e embriagado de privilégios, ele defende transferir nossos “direitos humanos” para as mãos desses mesmos juízes.

Alexandre de Morais declarou que a “presunção de inocência é relativa”, e negou habeas corpus a Lula.

O voto de Luis Roberto Barroso foi o pior de todos: demagógico e incoerente. Após denunciar, quase chorando, que a maior parte dos presos são pessoas pobres, negras, mantidos em estado de prisão provisória, Barroso dá uma pirueta retórica para usar esse mesmo fato para justificar a relativização do princípio constitucional da presunção de inocência. Ou seja, ao invés de defender que o judiciário se revise a si mesmo, e pare de prender tanta gente por razões menores, ele defende ampliar o poder do mesmo judiciário!

Tratados internacionais e constituições estrangeiros são citados repetidamente como fuga do próprio texto constitucional, que entende dar amplas garantias aos cidadãos justamente por causa do histórico autoritário do Estado brasileiro. Barroso chega a mencionar leis islâmicas!

Barroso insiste nos argumentos esquizofrênicos, contraditórios: ele informa, com base num cálculo “artesanal” feito por sua assessora, que um percentual mínimo de réus conseguem, efetivamente, habeas corpus favoráveis. Ora, ao invés de concluir que isso é prova do autoritarismo judicial, ele infere que essa é a razão para eliminar de vez o habeas corpus para todos!

O ministro cometeu várias desonestidades intelectuais. Todos os pressupostos dele são a favor da condenação. Os recursos são sempre procrastinatórios, porque o réu é… culpado. O longo tempo de espera para o fim do processo beneficia o réu, porque… o réu é culpado.

Não passa pela cabeça de Barroso a ideia iluminista (não o iluminismo da Globo, que ele professa) de que o Estado e a Justiça estatal não são divinos, e que o princípio filosófico da presunção de inocência é a base de um sistema penal humanista, justamente pelo fato de que, ao longo de milênios, o absolutismo judicial foi talvez o elemento mais reacionário e perigoso das eras sombrias que antecederam a chegada da modernidade.

Depois de afirmar que não tinha lido a sentença de primeira instância, nem da segunda, afirmou que votava contra o habeas corpus para Lula.

Rosa Weber fez um discurso confuso, hermético, para ao cabo também negar habeas corpus a Lula e, com isso, praticamente mandar Lula à prisão. Weber negou seu próprio entendimento anterior, em favor do texto constitucional, que é bem claro: o réu é inocente até sentença transitado em julgado. Em suma, Rosa Weber disse que é favor da interpretação literal da Constituição, ou seja, contra a prisão em segunda instância, e em favor do habeas corpus, mas que, neste caso, a “literatura” lhe permitia mandar Lula à masmorra.

Ao fim da leitura de Weber, que definiu o resultado da votação, Marco Aurélio Mello pede para que seja registrado nos autos que a operação de Carmen Lucia, de levar a plenário o caso Lula antes de discutir a questão mais geral da prisão em segunda instância, determinou o seu resultado, pois Weber deixou claro que votaria diferente se o que estivesse em jogo fosse essa questão geral e não o caso individual de Lula.

O fato sombrio por trás de todo o debate no STF é que a condenação de Lula foi totalmente irregular, porque não se apresentou nenhuma prova para corroborá-la.

Luiz Fux, que também nega o habeas corpus, cita um caso de linchamento de um estuprador como justificativa para o endurecimento do regime penal brasileiro.

O discurso de Fux é assustador: ele menciona, como justificativa principal de seu voto, o acompanhamento do “sentimento constitucional da sociedade”, porque decisões contramajoritárias não dariam “legitimidade democrática” ao judiciário, com risco de produzir “insatisfação social” e risco de “desobediência civil”. É uma justificativa incrivelmente fascista e covarde, além de incoerente, porque entende a “vontade social” como uma coisa única, monolítica, e que ele, juiz, e só ele, pode interpretar. Ora, a sociedade é dividida em classes, e o ministro Fux, quando fala em sentimento social, refere-se exclusivamente a uma determinada classe, aquela que tem o poder influenciar o seu voto. Ao agir assim, Fux não ajuda a dar nenhuma legitimidade democrática ao judiciário. Ao contrário, a sociedade começa entender que o judiciário não quer mais exercer um papel imparcial, de regular os conflitos, em especial o de classes. Isso não ajuda, evidentemente, a promover a paz social.

Toffoli fez uma defesa algo insegura do instituto da presunção de inocência e deu provimento ao pedido de habeas corpus.

Os melhores discursos da noite foram proferidos por Ricardo Lewandowski, Marco Aurelio e Celso de Melo. Ambos deram aulas magistrais sobre a importância dos direitos fundamentais e da fidelidade à Constituição brasileira.

A vitória política de Lula no STF

Os votos em seu favor foram os mais qualificados, idealistas e constitucionais. Os votos contra si foram incrivelmente medíocres, mesquinhos e desonestos. Essa diferença de qualidade causa impacto no mundo jurídico

“This is going to be a challenging election year,” McConnell said in a Tuesday interview with the Kentucky Today editorial board. “We know the wind is going to be in our face. We don’t know whether it’s going to be a Category 3, 4 or 5.”

The interview marked some of the bluntest comments this year by the top Senate Republican, who is defending a 51-49 majority in November. McConnell raised the possibility that Republicans will lose their House majority. In doing so, he offered a potential argument Republican Senate candidates could use on the campaign trail.

“I’m hoping we can hold the Senate,” he said, “and the principal reason for that, even if we were to lose the House and be stymied legislatively, we could still approve appointments, which is a huge part of what we do.”

McConnell’s remarks came as other prominent Republicans have been issuing warnings about the midterms. After a Wisconsin Supreme Court win by Democrats on Tuesday, Republican Gov. Scott Walker warned of a “#BlueWave” in a post on Twitter.

The Republican leader has been warning about the difficult climate for months. “We go into this cleareyed that this is going to be quite a challenging election,” he told the New York Times in February.

McConnell has frequently said that the Senate is in “the personnel business,” referring to its power to confirm executive branch nominees and federal judges. Last year, McConnell said the “single biggest issue in bringing Republicans home” in the 2016 election “was the Supreme Court.” That year, McConnell refused to fill a Supreme Court vacancy until after the election, making it an issue for voters to decide on in the campaign.

While recent special elections have shown there is a lot of energy in the Democratic Party, largely because of anger with President Trump, winning back control of the Senate will not be easy for the minority party. Democrats are defending seats in 10 seats in states Trump won in 2016. These include West Virginia and North Dakota, where Trump won by a wide margin.

For many conservative activists, judicial nominees are an important issue, giving McConnell’s emerging pitch on behalf of Republican Senate candidates some potential to energize them. At the same time, McConnell is battling against criticism from some on the right that he has not been an effective leader. Even Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, whom McConnell helped recruit to run for the Senate, would not commit to supporting him as leader if he is elected.

“I think it’s a little premature to say who I would and wouldn’t vote for,” Hawley said in a recent interview with The Washington Post.

225,1,,"Donald Trump is still a central focus of Robert Mueller’s special counsel probe, with The Washington Post reporting on Tuesday that Trump “remains under investigation.”

According to the Post, “Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III informed President Trump’s attorneys last month that he is continuing to investigate the president but does not consider him a criminal target at this point, according to three people familiar with the discussions.”

More from the new report:

In private negotiations in early March about a possible presidential interview, Mueller described Trump as a subject of his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Prosecutors view someone as a subject when that person has engaged in conduct that is under investigation but there is not sufficient evidence to bring charges.

Trump and his supporters will likely point to this report as goods news, but it’s important to remember that Mueller told this to the White House as part of a negotiation to get the president to sit down for an interview.

Divulging to Trump that he is a non-criminal target could be a negotiating tactic for Mueller. After all, if Mueller told the president he was on the verge of being criminally charged, Trump would be much less likely to cooperate.

Not to mention: A sit-down interview with Trump is key to building any possible criminal case against him, particularly when it comes to obstruction of justice.

The most important part of The Washington Post story isn’t the news that Trump is not officially a criminal target of the investigation. It’s that Mueller is preparing a report about whether the president’s personal actions since taking office constitute obstruction of justice.

More from the Post report:

The special counsel also told Trump’s lawyers that he is preparing a report about the president’s actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations.

Mueller reiterated the need to interview Trump — both to understand whether he had any corrupt intent to thwart the Russia investigation and to complete this portion of his probe, the people said.

Clearly, Trump is still the central figure in Mueller’s investigation. The fact that Mueller told the White House that Trump isn’t under criminal investigation is essentially meaningless. It could change at a moment’s notice as the special counsel continues to gather more evidence.

The fact that the president remains an active target suggests that Mueller is still working to compile more information. Getting the president to sit down for an interview is key to that process.

Once the president opens his mouth in a potential special counsel interview, he’ll likely give Robert Mueller all the information he needs to bury Trump, if not criminally then certainly politically.

226,1,0.0,"Investors were digesting an announcement from Chinese officials that they intend to increase tariffs by up to 25 percent on a list of 106 American goods, a response to President Donald Trump’s move to punish China for its trade deficit with the U. S.

“The broadening scope of US-China trade tensions is seen as a growing threat to global growth and corporate earnings,” said Alec Young of FTSE Russell.

Earlier on Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross downplayed Beijing's response, telling CNBC, “I’m frankly a little surprised that Wall Street was so surprised by it. This has been telegraphed for days and weeks.”

Ross also said he considered it likely that the current situation could lead to negotiations between the two economic powerhouses, especially since the tariffs would not be enforced immediately.

""The market is concerned about this thing escalating right now,"" James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, told CNBC. ""It's not so bad if we have a few tariffs on a few products, but if it escalates worldwide, then you're really threatening the recovery globally.""

227,1,,"CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin warned the White House not to celebrate a report on Tuesday that President Donald Trump is not a criminal target in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Trump instead is a “subject” of the probe, according to The Washington Post, but Toobin said that’s a distinction that could change quickly.

Toobin said “targets” are often charged and “witnesses” are generally people needed for information.

“In between the two, there is something called the “subject.” That is someone who is under investigation but who may or may not be charged. Trump is a subject, and I don’t think that is particularly good news for him. It’s a big deal to be under criminal investigation by the FBI, particularly if you’re president of the United States.”

“This confirmation that the president is under criminal investigation, that is a pretty profound thing to think about,” he added.

Toobin also said that former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who has been indicted in the probe, is in “desperate legal trouble” and might be about to turn on the president.

230,1,,"“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did,

but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

In a life rich with experiences and stories, author, poet, memoirist, and activist Dr. Maya Angelou touched the lives of millions around the globe through her teachings, her writings, her voice, and her actions.

Born Marguerite Annie Johnson in 1928, her incredible story began with tragedy when a sexual assault at the age of seven rendered her mute for five years. During those years, however, books and poetry became her solace and constant companions, eventually helping her find her voice again to embark upon an intellectual and creative journey that defies description.

In her her teens and early adult life Dr. Angelou saw more experiences than many do in a lifetime: from motherhood, to becoming San Francisco’s first female and black streetcar conductor, to touring the world as a cast member of the opera Porgy and Bess — all while mastering several languages. She sang and danced in professional cabarets, worked as a journalist in Africa, and became one of the most prominent civil rights activists of her generation.

The success of her first book, “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” in 1969 brought her mainstream attention as an author. Six other autobiographical works followed, in addition to poetry, children’s literature, and non-fiction (even cookbooks!).

Through her works, Dr. Angelou gave a voice to millions. She championed women’s rights and gender equality. She redefined black beauty and celebrated African-American oral traditions. She advocated against war and campaigned for universal peace.

She was also the recipient of numerous honors during her lifetime. She became the first poet to make an inaugural recitation in three decades when Bill Clinton became President in 1992. Her vast impact on popular culture was also felt through a host of award nominations, public accolades, and more than 50 honorary degrees.

Today’s video Doodle celebrates Dr. Maya Angelou on what would have been her 90th birthday. Set to her poem “Still I Rise,” the Doodle includes her own voice along with the voices of other individuals whose lives she has inspired, and who aspire to live by her legacy today.

Special thanks to these project partners who include (in order of appearance):

​“Maya Angelou, I love her so much. Everything she represented as a woman, her creativity, her story, who she is. She was a renaissance woman of all types, she recreated though levels, all angles, all places in her mind. She is brilliant...I am honored to be able to say her words.""

""Being around Maya was so powerful and inspiring. I count myself very blessed to be one of the ones chosen to be a part of this. For some reason she took a liking to me and went out of her way to extend herself to me and I am forever grateful for that.""

""Dr. Angelou's work is filled with such incredible wisdom and spiritual teachings. It feels like the ultimate privilege to have the opportunity to speak her words. She is a national treasure we should always celebrate.”

“Maya Angelou is not what she has done or written or spoken, it's how she did it all.  She moved through the world with unshakeable calm, confidence, and a fiery, fierce grace and abounding love.”

Here’s to Dr. Maya Angelou for her courage, compassion, and words, which continue to inspire hope around the world.

Special thanks to Dr. Angelou’s son Guy Johnson and his wife Stephanie Floyd-Johnson for their close partnership on this project. Below, Guy shares his personal thoughts on his mother and her legacy:

As we spend what would have been my mother’s ninetieth birthday, I think of her melodious tones speaking about the need for tolerance, understanding, forgiveness and love.  My mother’s perspective was that human beings being social animals are strongest when they are unified. She saw hatred and greed, not only as divisive, but as the forces of evil.  She recognized that unlike positive virtues, neither greed nor hatred has to be taught; they come naturally and have to be untaught in order to free their possessor of their burdensome weight and baggage.  She saw one of our greatest challenges was learning to love ourselves, then having the courage and the wisdom to love others. She often said, “We don’t know how or why love occurs. Truthfully, we don’t know that even gravity isn’t a kind of love.”  She felt that love was one of the most important emotions and was an instrumental key to unlocking the inner doors of our ignorance and fear.

My mother’s principal message was one of inclusiveness; that despite our ethnic, religious and cultural differences, we are more alike than unalike.  She saw all our differences in language, orientation and perspective as an indication of the richness of our imagination and creativity, and as elements of our nature that we should celebrate.  She believed that we are all images of God, no matter how we look or what name we use to call upon the Divine and Sacred Being.

She saw that the world was in need of our attention and effort; from the hunger and poverty that are present in so many countries, to our wars, internecine conflicts and indiscriminate terroristic acts, to the destructive pollution, deforestation and the reduction of the biodiversity of the life forms around us.  Our planet is crying out for help. My mother would say, ‘Don’t just complain about the problems you see and do nothing; roll up your sleeves and get to work finding solutions and remedies. We do a disservice to our children and to the future by not addressing the problems that confront us. Nor should our efforts for change be thwarted or stifled by the obstacles arrayed against us.  We must steel ourselves with courage and perseverance and battle on for what is right.” For my mother the most important virtue was courage, because without courage none of the other virtues can be practiced consistently.

My mother did not herself go to college to pursue a degree. Although, as she rose in stature, as a public figure she was awarded Honorary Doctorates by more than fifty major universities and colleges.  She understood education was extremely important; to that end she was a voracious reader, consuming two to three books a week from the time she was a teenager until her vision failed in her eighties. She used to ask me, “Can you imagine what the world would be like if all children on earth had access to a good education and were allowed to let their inner lights glow?  Oh, we would have the cure to cancer and remedies to most of the major problems that confront us. The knowledge that would be generated by that level of brain power would give us access to the stars, to the universe as well as to our dreams.”

My mother’s assessment of human beings was that we were neither gods nor demons, but that we carried elements of both within ourselves; that the onus was upon each of us to control the demons of anger, jealousy and hate and find the spirit of a caring and forgiving God within our souls.

231,1,,"Maya Angelou, poet, memoirist, essayist, playwright, screenwriter, Calypso singer and dancer in gay clubs in 1950s San Francisco, part of a dance duo with Alvin Ailey, colleague and civil rights worker with both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr., best friend to James Baldwin, first black Inaugural poet, friend and supporter of lesbians and gay men before it was trendy or popular and when it most mattered–that Maya Angelou died Wednesday morning, May 28 at her home in Winston-Salem, NC. She was 86.

Angelou wrote, “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

Maya Angelou always made me feel just a bit cut open. I rarely heard her speak or give an interview without tears coming to my eyes because she never spoke of easy things, even when she was telling a funny story, which was often, because humor and sadness were of a piece for her both in life and in her writing. Angelou had a deep voice and a big, easy laugh and those two things accompanied all her telling, soothing some of the truths she exposed. There was always that blurred dark edge to every tale that is the line most women walk between the world outside and the world inside. The world of second-class-ness that never leaves us, no matter how accomplished or famous or revered one is.

And she was all of those things, she was all of them.

When I read the breaking news alert that she had died, I felt a frisson of loss as if she were my own family–she and her work had always been that much of a steady presence in my life, even if she was on its periphery. She staked that claim for many women, from her “adopted” daughter, Oprah Winfrey, to American high school students reading her for the first time. She was that vibrant, that rich, that fervent, that knowing.

Some writers have that ability to touch places in us that few are able to touch. Angelou was one of those.

She wasn’t a complex writer, but her work had a realness and deceptive simplicity that made it highly accessible to a wide readership. Angelou was prolific and her work was as varied as it was fervid.

Her early work is raw and uneven, but incredibly compelling. You feel bruised and torn after reading it, because it has taken you deep into another place, a hidden place. That was, for many female readers and readers of color, a place we knew well, a place of secrets and lies, torments and too-little retribution. So when Angelou took us there–whether we’d been prepared or not–we were different at the end of it. We had thought it was our place alone and now we knew there were others, had been others all along.

I read I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings in college, in a Women’s Studies course when I was the same age she was when the memoir cuts off–17. It had been published years earlier and was an international best-seller by then and Angelou’s was a well-established voice. Nevertheless, with its open discussion of lesbianism and prostitution and depictions of explicit sexuality, it was a far cry from most of our other assignments. Angelou was not Austen.

Angelou’s was one of the first of the Second Wave feminist memoir to open that secret door of telling that became the foundation for that first generation of lesbian activists of the late 70s and early 80s–myself among them. We were schooled by radical women like Angelou and Audre Lorde, Mary Daly and Andrea Dworkin, Adrienne Rich and Toni Morrison, Gerda Lerner and Julia Penelope, Jill Johnston and Pat Parker, Toni Cade Bambara and Alice Walker, Germaine Greer and Kate Millet, Shulamith Firestone and Angela Davis.

Black and white, straight and lesbian, middle class and poor, educated and self-taught they were that army of brilliant, courageous women we had never had behind us as girls, voices whose breadth and depth, range and strength would bolster us and send us forward to storm the next round of patriarchal battlements.

Maya Angelou was one of those women, those truth-tellers, those passionate, unwavering voices who knew the only thing that stood between us and freedom, us and equality, us and wholeness was our second-class status, the silencing of us because of our sex, the reinforcement of the social constructs of gender that were fake and dangerous and allowed men to treat us like we weren’t fully human.

Angelou was the first to shred the veil between euphemism and raw reality on the topic of rape. Yes, Susan Brownmiller’s seminal book, Against Our Will would tell us the history and statistical analysis of rape and that would be shattering on another level altogether, but what Angelou did was different.

She boldly told her own story. In my faded and underlined paperback copy I have kept all these years since that college class I had written in one margin: She knows. She knows about us. She knows about all of us.

Angelou was raped at seven by her mother’s boyfriend. After she testified against him, he spent a day in prison, before being released on bail. After he was released, he was beaten to death by a group of vigilantes–Angelou believed by her uncles.

The experience terrified her. She stopped speaking, mute from fear. She wrote, “My seven-and-a-half-year-old logic deduced that my voice had killed him. I thought, my voice killed him. I killed that man, because I told his name. And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone…I didn’t speak for nearly six years.”

Those of us who were sexually assaulted as children understood the fear, the shame, the surety that if we told the truth, the world–our world–would split open. Angelou’s words resonated for a generation of women. She had spoken what till then had been unspoken and more–taboo.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings details that experience and its aftermath, doing what Mary Daly taught us was vital to all feminist development: dis-covering our own female history.

In doing so, Angelou discovered the truth for millions of women, a truth we were never allowed to say aloud, a truth one in four American girls and countless others worldwide share–the truth of child sexual assault, the truth of rape, the truth that girl children are commodities in literature and porn alike. And of course, in their own homes.

Angelou told us rape happened, it had happened to her, it had happened to us. She told us it had both broken and healed her. She told us that we could be mended and move on and mend others and that activism had many, many faces and ours could be one of them, should be one of them.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings isn’t just a memoir, or a coming of age tale. It’s a book of lessons for girls and women, regardless of race or class or sexual orientation. One can pull quotes applicable for all women, especially those feeling their Otherness and marginalization and the push to sameness.

In the book Angelou writes, “To be left alone on the tightrope of youthful unknowing is to experience the excruciating beauty of full freedom and the threat of eternal indecision.

Few, if any, survive their teens. Most surrender to the vague but murderous pressure of adult conformity. It becomes easier to die and avoid conflict than to maintain a constant battle with the superior forces of maturity.”

Yet Angelou is, of course, writing about a particular time and place, the era of the Jim Crow South and women who are supposed to put up and shut up–particularly black women.

So she tells us, clearly, what that means and how it applies to girls, to youth of color, to queers: “At fifteen life had taught me undeniably that surrender, in its place, was as honorable as resistance, especially if one had no choice.”

In others words: stay alive to adulthood. Then breathe.

Angelou iterates the internecine connection between racism and misogyny seamlessly. She wrote, “If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat. It is an unnecessary insult.”

That line. That magnificent, gut-churning line–so perfectly explicative in stating what it is to be a black woman in the white, Jim Crow South, it takes your breath away.

Hilton Als, literary scholar, editor at The New Yorker, and a black gay man who has written extensively about the various correlatives between being black and gay, black and male, female and male in American society interviewed Angelou for The New Yorker in the August 5, 2002 issue. “Songbird: Maya Angelou Takes Another Look at Herself” is a provocative portrait of the then-74 year old Angelou.

Als situates her firmly as an orchestrator of a new generation of black feminist writing. He notes that I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was iconoclastic: it marked, Als explained, one of the first times a black autobiographer had been able to “write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense.”

Als also asserts that Angelou helped spawn other black feminist writing in the 1970s, referencing black feminist writing’s “resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist” and in the time in which it was written, the waning years of the black civil rights movement.

He insists that Angelou’s writings, because they delve more deeply into “self-revelation” than the more explicit politics of the time, including feminism, freed other women writers to “open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world.”

Which is exactly what those of us reading Angelou’s work in a college classroom felt: freed to speak our own truths the way she had spoken hers.

Not everyone has appreciated Angelou’s work over the years and she is still, Inaugural poet status aside, frequently censored by schools. The same things that I and other budding lesbian feminists had found so comforting in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings continues to unsettle parents and school boards 45 years after its publication. Her books are often removed from school curricula and libraries. According to the National Coalition Against Censorship, most frequent objections to I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings are its depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography and violence.

The sexually explicit scenes, use of extreme language and lesbianism landed I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings third on the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 and sixth on the ALA’s 2000–2010 list.

Obviously, if it still unsettles readers decades after its publication, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings resonates. If Angelou had never written anything else, never done anything else, if she had been another Harper Lee or Henry Roth with one, single, truth-telling, life-altering, shibboleth-shattering book in her, that really would have been enough. Because those words at that time were words we’d never heard before and they still resonate, 45 years after she wrote them. As Als contemporizes her work in that 2002 profile, she is both an iconoclast of that time and also able to move beyond any restraints of that very turbulent and utterly political era, in part, no doubt, because she focused on how her own experience might inform that of others.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings may have been her first memoir, but of course there was much more work to come. She would write seven memoirs as well as numerous books of poetry and essays. She both acted in and wrote plays. And in 1993 she broke more ground when she was chosen by Bill Clinton to read a poem at his first inauguration, an event which would win her the popular title of “the black woman’s poet laureate.”

It had been a steady, but arduous climb to that place.

Angelou’s early years were riven with pain and suffering, but none of it kept her from being a true citizen of the world. She gave birth to her only son, Clyde, who later changed his name to Guy, less than a month after she graduated from high school. She was 17.

The next few years were dicey and dangerous. As she wrote, she was a madam and a prostitute, involved in petty crime and whatever else would support her and her infant son. But by 1951 she was living in San Francisco and singing in straight and gay clubs, her focus the Calypso music so popular in the 1950s. She had also met the iconic black gay dancer and choreographer, Alvin Ailey, and the two of them formed a dance team, “Al and Rita.” (Maya was her brother’s pet name for her, but she was born Marguerite Johnson, and most people called her Rita. She became Maya Angelou when one of the club owners thought it sounded more exotic and would promote her Calypso act.) In 1954 she was cast in the musical “House of Flowers,” written by Truman Capote and Harold Arlen.

By 1960 she’d had a reasonably successful album of Calypso music debut and she had focused on acting, starring in a production of Jean Genet’s The Blacks with a remarkable cast that included James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson, Louis Gossett and Abby Lincoln.

Angelou spent the early 1960s in the American expatriate community in Ghana, which was where she met Malcolm X. Their closeness led her back to the U. S. where she renewed her deep friendship with her “brother,” James Baldwin.

Angelou said she and Baldwin “became friends in the late 50’s, just as the United States was poised to make its quantum leap into the future; just as Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and other Southerners were girding themselves for the second civil war in one hundred years; and just when Malcolm X was giving voice to the anger in the streets and in the minds of northern black city folks.”

Her love for her friend’s work influenced her own. Angelou asserted, “I hear Baldwin as apart of the continuity, begun if you will for me anyway, with Frederick Douglass in 1849 in the slave narrative. I hear his voice. I hear Baldwin when I think of Jupiter Hammon, a slave in the 18th century. I hear Baldwin in the music, the lyric really, of George Moses Horton, writing about 1840, ’50. He wrote ‘Alas, and was I born for this, to wear this slavish chain–’ I hear Baldwin.”

It was Baldwin, with whom she was spending the majority of her time in that period, who urged her to write I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. He introduced Angelou to Richard Loomis at Random House, who would be her editor for decades. Loomis was convinced Angelou, who was then determined to succeed as a poet and playwright, should write an autobiography.

Angelou recalled in a 2008 interview with NPR, “The truth is that he had talked to James

Baldwin, my brother friend, and Jimmy told him that ‘if you want Maya Angelou to do something, tell her she can’t do it.’” (Read more about their relationship here.)

In the 1960s Angelou spent as much time working for black civil rights as she did writing. She and Malcolm X formed the Organization of Afro-American Unity.

After the murder of Malcolm X and the dissolution of the organization, Angelou worked closely with Martin Luther King, Jr. She succeeded Bayard Rustin as the coordinator of the New York office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Rustin and King had co-founded the SCLC, a primary conduit of the civil rights movement.

While the assassination of Malcolm X had left her “devastated and adrift,” Baldwin’s support was pivotal to her during this period and it propelled her to write while she worked with King on several civil rights initiatives. In 1968 Dr. King had requested that she work with him to organize another march to rival the 1963 March on Washington. But just weeks after their meeting, he was assassinated. On her 40th birthday. For years afterward she refused to celebrate her birthday, instead sending flowers to Coretta Scott King.

In her later years Angelou focused on her teaching (she was Reynolds professor of American studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem) and her poetry, which had evolved into a performance/spoken-word style. She was a frequent lecturer and guest speaker and appeared often on talk shows as well as Sesame Street where she promoted her love of books for children.

Among my favorite poems of hers are “Phenomenal Woman” and “And Still I Rise.” In the latter she draws heavily from the call and response of the Southern black churches of her youth and the intonation of evangelizing that was a staple of her compatriots in the civil rights movement. You can hear her read this at PoemHunter.com, and I recommend that, because her marvelous, mellifluous voice, with all its richness and provocative accentuations is part of the revelations of this poem, but, here it is in its entirety, from the PoemHunter.com site:

You may write me down in history

With your bitter, twisted lies,

You may tread me in the very dirt

But still, like dust, I’ll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?

Why are you beset with gloom?

‘Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells

Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,

With the certainty of tides,

Just like hopes springing high,

Still I’ll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?

Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops.

Weakened by my soulful cries.

Does my haughtiness offend you?

Don’t you take it awful hard

‘Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines

Diggin’ in my own back yard.

You may shoot me with your words,

You may cut me with your eyes,

You may kill me with your hatefulness,

But still, like air, I’ll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?

Does it come as a surprise

That I dance like I’ve got diamonds

At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history’s shame

I rise

Up from a past that’s rooted in pain

I rise

I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,

Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear

I rise

Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear

I rise

Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,

I am the dream and the hope of the slave.

I rise

I rise

I rise.

There are surprises in this seemingly simple work–the humor, the darkness, the sexuality. But at the core Angelou is doing what she does in all her writing–unites the twin themes of racism and misogyny. She never stopped talking about how racism and sexism were the ruination of the planet and how they had held back not just America, but the world that she was so much a citizen of. Her refusal to ignore sexism and its impact on black women set her apart from many of her contemporaries for whom feminism was “over.”

Angelou’s descriptions of men were always quixotic and it’s instructive that in 2008 she campaigned for Hillary Clinton, not Barack Obama. About her own father, Bailey Johnson, she wrote, “He was a lonely person, searching relentlessly in bottles, under women’s skirts, in church work and lofty job titles for his ‘personal niche,’ lost before birth and unrecovered since. How maddening it was to have been born in a cotton field with aspirations of grandeur.”

Angelou had surrounded herself with gay men most of her life. Many of her pivotal personal and professional relationships, particularly in the first half of her life, were with gay men–her brief dance team with Alvin Ailey, who pre-deceased her by 25 years, dying of AIDS in 1988. She worked on Genet and with Capote and one of her enduring influences was James Baldwin.

Her friendship with him was a definite nexus for her between racism and sexism, homophobia in the black community being rife then–she knew it was why she was succeeding Rustin at SCLC. Her clarity on these issues is evident when she writes that Baldwin sought to escape racism in France as she had in Ghana. But it followed them both. She notes, “France was not without its race prejudices. It simply didn’t have any guilt vis-à-vis black Americans. And black Americans who went there, from Richard Wright to Sidney Bechet, were so colorful and so talented and so marvelous and so exotic—Who wouldn’t want them? Of course. But among the people they did not want in France were the Algerians. As Jimmy said, they were the niggers of France. To him, they were his brothers. He was very outspoken during the Algerian War, when they had been trying to win their freedom from France in the 50’s. He wrote about the Algerians in No Name in the Street.”

Angelou’s attention to the complications of racism and sexism enfolded Baldwin easily. As Angelou had broken ground for women–all women, regardless of race–by exploring taboo subjects, so had Baldwin by addressing homosexuality. Angelou writes of him, “In this particular society, we are supposed to be so contained. Men are supposed to be men. Women are supposed to be women, and not need, really need, anybody. The ability to ask ‘Will you be my brother?’–the courage to ask–is often missing. James Baldwin was a brother. Incredible!”

In her final years, however, it was women with whom she spent her time, focused on the role of black women from her past and her present. Her last book, the best-selling Mom & Me & Mom was part memoir, part discourse on the role of the black woman in society. It was the seventh and final volume of her autobiographical series.

Angelou was the recipient of more than 30 honorary degrees and she preferred to be called Dr. Angelou. She received a Pulitzer Prize nomination for her book of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ‘fore I Diiie, a Tony Award nomination for her role in the 1973 play Look Away and three Grammys for her spoken word albums. She served on two presidential committees and was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2000, the Lincoln Medal in 2008 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, in 2011. When she performed at Clinton’s inauguration, she was the first poet to read at a presidential inauguration since Robert Frost in 1961.

Angelou was widely quoted and eminently quotable. A few of her most enduring are:

“Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. But anger is like fire. It burns it all clean.”

“One isn’t necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can’t be kind, true, merciful, generous or honest.”

But she also said, “There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.” Angelou told stories that no one else before her had done. Putting those stories down on the yellow legal pads on which she wrote made her, the girl from Stamps, Arkansas whose mother told her she wasn’t pretty so she needed to be smart–that girl, that woman, became internationally known, with millions of books in print.

Marguerite Johnson, named for her great-grandmother, a freed slave, began as a caged bird. As Maya Angelou she ended flying free and teaching others how it’s done. Her remarkable life, her extraordinary work, affected the lives of millions of women. She wasn’t a caged bird for very long, but even in death, she still sings.

“News anchors looking into camera and reading a script handed down by a corporate overlord, words meant to obscure the truth not elucidate it, isn’t journalism,” Rather tweeted on Monday.  He went on to call the practice “Orwellian” and “propaganda.”

Sinclair came under fire over the weekend after Deadspin released this video, which splices together dozens of the company’s local affiliates reading from the same anti-“false news” script.

Sinclair, in turn, released a lengthy memo to its newsrooms across the country saying, “There is a lot of noise out there about our company right now, and what is lacking in that analysis is something we constantly preach: context and perspective.”

The memo, written by Sinclair Senior Vice President Scott Livingston, then lists a number of accomplishments by the group’s various newsrooms.

Fox analyst Gregg Jarrett faced the wrath of former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti after asking Mueller and DOJ Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to resign.

“Unethical Mueller, in his court filing, admits that Rosenstein’s order appointing him was intentionally vague,” Jarrett claimed. “This violates the special counsel law that requires a specific statement of facts to be investigated.”

“Rosenstein and Muller (sic) colluded to break the law and should resign,” Jarrett demanded.

Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti posted a link to Jarrett’s claims and asked, “Can you spot all of the errors in his 280-character attack on Mueller?”

Mariotti charged “Jarrett’s attack is full of basic errors of law and fact.”

“Jarrett’s attack on Mueller is factually and legally inaccurate and fails to take into account what Mueller said in the court filing that Jarrett supposedly read and is responding to,” Mariotti concluded. “He shouldn’t be passing off this deliberately misleading attack as ‘analysis.'”

The 45-year-old actor has become known as one of the biggest action heroes in showbiz, but has opened up for the first time about his inner struggles.

He confessed that the bouts of low mood started when he was living in poverty as a child – and witnessed his mother Ata attempt suicide when he was just fifteen years old.

Speaking to the Express, he revealed: ""She got out of the car on the Interstate 65 in Nashville and walked into oncoming traffic.

""Big rigs and cars were swerving out the way. I grabbed her and pulled her back on the gravel shoulder of the road.""

Dwayne admits that his mum was in such a state during the attempt that she doesn’t even recall trying to take her own life.

""She has no recollection of it whatsoever,"" he admitted. ""Probably best she doesn't.""

Os dois eram trabalhadores, serviam à PM de Santa Catarina(SC) e escolheram espartano programa de viagens, ficando em pousadas no Litoral Norte potiguar, certamente atraído por comerciais de dunas e mares inspiradores.

237,1,0.0,"America has had its share of crooks (Warren G. Harding, Richard Nixon), bigots (Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan), and incompetents (Andrew Johnson, George W. Bush). But never before Donald Trump have we had a president who combined all these nefarious qualities.

America’s great good fortune was to begin with the opposite — a superb moral leader. By June of 1775, when congress appointed George Washington to command the nation’s army, he had already “become a moral rallying post,” as his biographer, Douglas Southall Freeman, described him. He was,“the embodiment of the purpose, the patience, and the determination necessary for the triumph of the revolutionary cause.”

Washington won the war and then led the fledgling nation “by directness, by deference, and by manifest dedication to duty.”

A president’s most fundamental legal and moral responsibility is to uphold and protect our system of government. Donald Trump has degraded that system.

When he threatens to loosen federal libel laws so he can sue news organizations that are critical of him and revoke licenses of networks critical of him, he isn’t just bullying the media. He’s threatening the constitutionally guaranteed freedom and integrity of the press.

When he equated Neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members with counter-demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, by blaming “both sides” for the violence, he wasn’t being neutral. He was condoning white supremacists, thereby undermining the constitution’s guarantee of equal rights.

When he pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, for a criminal contempt conviction, he wasn’t just signaling it’s okay for the police to engage in violations of civil rights. He was also subverting the rule of law by impairing the judiciary’s power to force public officials to abide by court decisions.

241,4,,"While Attorney General Jeff Sessions has decided to hold off on naming a second special counsel, he reached well outside Washington for a federal prosecutor to investigate possible wrongdoing by the FBI and Justice Department.

“The [Justice] Department is not above criticism and it can never be that the department conceals errors when they occur,” AG Jeff Sessions says.

Sessions announced Thursday in a letter to members of Congress that, rather than name another special counsel, he has tapped Utah U. S. Attorney John Huber to work with the Justice Department’s inspector general to review multiple issues of Justice Department and FBI conduct.

The conduct under scrutiny occurred during the Obama administration as FBI and Justice officials investigated matters connected with 2016 presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

“We understand that the [Justice] Department is not above criticism and it can never be that the department conceals errors when they occur,” Sessions said in the letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.; and House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S. C.

“I am confident that Mr. Huber’s review will include a full, complete, and objective evaluation of these matters in a manner that is consistent with the law and facts,” Sessions wrote, adding:

I receive regular updates from Mr. Huber and upon the conclusion of his review, will receive his recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a special counsel.

Huber will work in coordination with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who has been examining related issues, Sessions said.

Here are five sets of background information about Huber and his investigation:

President Barack Obama nominated Huber, then 47, to serve as U. S. attorney for Utah in 2015, and he was confirmed by the Senate that June.

Utah’s two Republican senators, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, both gave him their highest recommendations.

Huber offered his resignation in March 2017 to allow the new Trump Justice Department to decide his fate. The administration decided to keep him.

Last June, Trump renominated Huber for the position and the Senate confirmed him in August by a unanimous vote.

Huber gained some national prominence in the Justice Department before his appointment as U. S. attorney. Two previous U.S. attorneys general, John Ashcroft in 2004 and Eric Holder in 2010, recognized his prosecutorial efforts, according to the department.

While serving as U. S. attorney, Huber was on the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee under both the Obama and Trump administrations. In 2017, Sessions named Huber vice chairman of the panel.

Huber also led the committee’s Terrorism and National Security Subcommittee as well as the interagency Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee.

Huber provided training to other federal prosecutors nationally on issues of domestic violence, national security, and violent crimes.

Last year, he was chairman of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area that serves Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Utah.

A 1995 graduate of the University of Utah S. J. Quinney College of Law, Huber began his career as a prosecutor in the office of the county attorney of Weber County, Utah. He later served as chief prosecutor for West Valley City, Utah.

Huber became an assistant U. S. attorney in 2002, and earned a national reputation for prosecutions of violent crimes and expertise in national security issues.

Special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, is probing alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 election season.

After Sessions recused himself because of his own advisory role in the campaign, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein selected Mueller as special counsel in part because he was not currently working in the Justice Department.

Sessions’ choice of a prosecutor inside the Justice Department but outside Washington is similar to past precedents. One difference is that Huber will be working with Horowitz, the department’s inspector general.

Inspectors general have investigative power within a single agency, in this case the Justice Department. But an inspector general can’t prosecute individuals or subpoena information.

As a prosecutor, Huber can expand the investigation into individuals or institutions outside the Justice Department itself. A prosecutor has the power to call a grand jury to subpoena information and issue indictments.

This is similar to the Bush administration Justice Department’s appointment of Patrick Fitzgerald, a U. S. attorney from Illinois, to investigate the leaking of CIA employee Valerie Plame’s name.

The Sessions letter comes just days after the department announced that the inspector general was investigating how the FBI applied the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to spy on a former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

The FBI obtained a warrant that relied heavily on an opposition research document—the Christopher Steele dossier—funded by Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.

A declassified House intelligence committee memo alleged that FBI and Justice officials did not fully inform the FISA court that information they used in seeking the warrant to spy was based on a political document.

Former top FBI officials also could face legal scrutiny.

Acting on the recommendation of the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility, Sessions fired Andrew McCabe as FBI deputy director for allegedly lying to the inspector general about media leaks.

McCabe said former FBI Director James Comey authorized media leaks. Days before being fired by Trump, Comey testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not leak or direct leaks.

Uranium One, a Russia-connected firm that had close ties to the Clinton Foundation, also is expected to be part of the probe, the Salt Lake City Tribune reported.

Rosenstein was the U. S. attorney for Maryland in 2004, and prosecuted Uranium One associates.

Lee, also a former assistant U. S. attorney in Utah, worked with Huber.

“U. S. Attorney John Huber is a capable public servant and a man of great integrity,” Lee said in a written statement to The Daily Signal.

Hatch, the senior senator from Utah, praised the selection.

“Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed today in a letter to Congress that United States Attorney John Huber, Utah’s top federal prosecutor, has been leading the investigation of certain issues related to actions by the Department of Justice in 2016 and 2017,” Hatch said in a public statement, adding:

Mr. Huber brings decades of experience to his latest, and now very public, assignment. Most importantly, he brings the independent perspective of an accomplished federal prosecutor who has spent his career far removed from the politics of Washington. Attorney General Sessions has picked the right man for the job. I am confident that Mr. Huber will perform these duties with the utmost integrity, and I look forward to learning the results of his work at the appropriate time.

Two House chairmen who asked for a special counsel said naming Huber to review the matter was a step in the right direction.

In a joint statement, Goodlatte and Gowdy said:

While we continue to believe the appointment of a second special counsel is necessary, this is a step in the right direction. We expect that U. S. Attorney Huber, given his reputation, will conduct an independent and thorough investigation. Such an investigation is critical to restoring the reputation of both the [FBI] and DOJ in the eyes of the American people.

We applaud the Attorney General for demonstrating his commitment to this investigation by selecting an individual outside of Washington, D.C., to lead the review. We think it is important that Mr. Huber report directly to the Attorney General since the Attorney General, as the head of the Justice Department, reserves the right to appoint a special counsel in the future.

In the meantime, we intend to continue our investigation into the decisions made and not made by DOJ in 2016 and 2017.

248,6,0.0,"The 2018 NCAA Final Four men’s basketball games are today and has two exciting matchups to determine which teams will earn the right to play for the NCAA Championship on Monday.

The early Final Four game of the 2018 NCAA Tournament feature two teams with the most exciting storylines. The Loyola Ramblers are only the fourth 11th seed to play in the Final Four. Notably, the previous three 11th seeded teams lost in their respective semifinal games (LSU in 1986, George Mason in 2006 and VCU in 2011). The Ramblers have a 14 game winning streak coming into the game against Michigan.

The Ramblers coached by Porter Moser will have their work cut out for them against the stellar defense of the Michigan Wolverines. Michigan has a 13 game winning streak going for them so one of those streaks ends tonight. Michigan coach John Beilein is coaching his second Final Four team, but he is still seeking his first title game.

Loyola will struggle to matchup with Michigan’s 6-foot-10 Moe Wagner. Wagner is an elite defensive rebounder and a solid offensive player who can shoot the three point shot as well as put the ball on the floor. Plus, if the Wolverines shoot lights out like they did two games ago, the Ramblers will be on life support.

The Wolverines end the Ramblers’ Cinderella story and Sister Jean’s hopes by 5 points. Michigan is just too good defensively.

The last two one seeds will match up in the other Final Four semifinal game. The Villanova Wildcats are in their second Final Four in three years. In 2016, the Wildcats went on to win the tournament and are the likely favorite to do so again in 2018. Villanova has the best offense in the country with six players averaging in double figures. The Wildcats are led by AP Player of the Year Jalen Brunson who averages 19.2 points and 4.6 assists per game.

The Kansas Jayhawks have not been in a Final Four semifinal game since 2012. The Jayhawks are led by senior guard Devonte’ Graham. Both teams have a lot of offensive firepower and it should make for an exciting, uptempo game.

Villanova has too much offense to be stopped and they defeat the Jayhawks in a tight game by three points.

250,6,0.0,"Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski acknowledged after the Super Bowl that he needed some time to think about whether he wants to keep playing. It sounds like he does, but it’s still not a sure thing.

Jeff Darlington of ESPN reports that Gronkowski recently told people he is likely to keep playing, but he has seriously considered retiring in part because of lingering frustration with coach Bill Belichick.

Gronkowski has battled injuries throughout his career, most recently a concussion in the AFC Championship Game. But reports have indicated his consideration of retiring may have more to do with being burned out emotionally than anything physical. Gronkowski has said that he saves the money he makes from the Patriots, so he could afford to retire, and he has other options, including acting and pro wrestling.

The report also says that Belichick has had some frustrations with Gronkowski and has questioned whether he’s fully committed to Belichick’s way of doing things.

If Gronkowski wants to keep playing, but not for Belichick, a trade could make sense for all involved. But the Patriots would surely want something significant in return for Gronkowski, and any team trading for him would need an assurance that he’s committed to continuing to play.

If Gronkowski is healthy and ready to go, he remains the best tight end in the NFL. His situation will bear monitoring until we have a definitive answer about his future.

In August 2017, we watched 1,069 'Dobi' machines stomp their way to victory in China – but now the mark has been raised to 1,372.

This latest attempt was organised by Italy’s TIM S.p. A. in Rome, using the Alpha 1S robot which is just under 40 cm (15.7 in) tall and made of aluminium alloy with a plastic coating.

The humanoids were built by UBTECH Robotics – a Chinese company which also engineered the first record-breaking dance off back in 2016.

The event was filmed for a TV show which is about a group of robots who are determined to learn to dance.

Guinness World Records adjudicator Lorenzo Veltri attended the shoot to make the record official, by ensuring all the machines were dancing at the same time and discounting any that fell during the attempt.

The Alpha 1S robot is extraordinarily flexible, which allows it to perform many different dance moves in time to music.

Plane ticket prices fluctuate, and when you purchase your ticket can mean a difference of literally hundreds of dollars, depending on where you’re traveling to.

Travel booking site CheapAir.com recently revealed the results of its 2018 Airfare study, a study where it looked at 917 million different flights listed on its site to determine where the perfect time to buy is. The results are pretty interesting.

The big question: How far in advance should you buy?

Everyone knows a last-minute plane ticket is probably expensive, but how far in advance do you need to purchase a ticket is a little less known.

According to the study, the best window of time to purchase a ticket in 2017 was 70 days in advance, a bit higher than the sweet spot in 2016 which was 54 days. However, that 70 was an average. The “best” time to buy actually depends on the season when you plan to travel.

In Winter you want to try for 62 days in advance, Spring 90 days in advance, Summer 47 days in advance, and Fall 69 days in advance, on average.

And as for that theory that there’s a best day of the week to buy - CheapAir says that’s not really true. Airfare during the week traditionally doesn’t fluctuate more than $2 from day to day, so you’re fine buying a ticket any day you want.

When it comes to when you fly, there is a difference. The cheapest days to fly are Tuesday and Wednesday, while Sunday is the most expensive.

This is just the latest bit of unconventional marketing from Deadpool 2. Star Ryan Reynolds previously revealed and actual X-Men Easter egg hunt ahead of Easter Sunday.

Deadpool 2 is scoring even higher with audiences than the first film did, which seems to contradict earlier rumors that Deadpool 2 is going through reshoots as a result of negative early testing, rumors that actress Brianna Hildebrand pushed back against.

""No, it was nothing that had gone wrong,” Hildebrand told ScreenGeek. ""I think it’s a common misconception too – that people think that reshoots are to fix things that people didn’t like. A lot of the time, reshoots are to add more of the things that people loved. [Filmmakers] watch their films again and are like 'better fix that.' I don’t know how much I can say about that.""

According to another report, the Deadpool 2 reshoots are specifically adding more of Josh Brolin’s Cable and Zazie Beetz’ Domino, two high profile X-Men character making their cinematic debuts, after both new characters tested particularly well with audiences.

The latest trailer for Deadpool 2 hints at Deadpool coming into conflict with Cable over the fate of a young mutant boy after Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) encourages Wade to look after the child.

Deadpool 2 opens in theaters on May 18th.

Where women were once dunked in the river, they're now subjected to the use of a squirt gun or a perfume bottle, and whipping is often skipped altogether. The communist government's discouragement of religious rituals played a role in this, as did movement of rural peoples to cities where such provincial antics aren't in vogue.

According to Visit Norway, the nation's official travel guide, this unique secular tradition dates back to 1923 and sprang from the hopes of two young and broke authors who needed their crime novel to strike gold.

On the day before Orthodox Easter, the faithful gather at Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on the site where many believe Jesus was crucified, entombed, and resurrected, to see an annual miracle they believe has occurred for over 1,200 years.

Orthodox church leaders annually perform a ceremony in which they receive a flame that is said to form at Christ's tomb, and bring it forth to light candles that spread the flame—and the faith—among the audience. The flame is then taken by special airplane to Russia, Greece, and other countries across the Orthodox world. (See ""These 12 Men Shaped Christianity—But Were They Real?"")

""There are often fireworks or even guns going off, and they pass this fire around to everyone in the square signifying this new life of Christ.”

""What we do is a mix, a combination of traditions from probably every kind of European immigrant we had, that's become uniquely American,"" Frese says.

The American bunny began to gain popular traction after the Civil War, with the rise of the nation's civil-religious holidays, and soon began to appear on cards.

“During the depression, for example, the bunny was often shown in factories where little animals were making the eggs for him to go out and deliver.”

Immigrants from new lands and faiths may alter the bunny tradition further as the years go by, Frese suggests. But however the bunny evolves, he'll always be true to his roots—whatever they may be.

256,2,1.0,"(Dubois, Wyo) – The Wyoming Wild Game Department (WWGD) partnering with the Wyoming Migration Initiative (WMI) have released the first of 5 planned batches of 90 Antilopine Kangaroos into the Wyoming outdoors.

Dubbed “Project Sage Hopper” by the WWGD team responsible for evaluating the viability of Wyoming’s habitat for Australian marsupials, it has been in the planning stages for 3 years. The goal is two-fold: Create new and interesting wildlife viewing opportunities for tourists, and in several years, potentially provide additional hunting opportunities.

“Antilopine means ‘antelope-like, so we are interested to see how these kangeroos adapt to Wyoming’s wild landscapes,” WMI Director Matt Kauffman said. “If they start migrating, we’ll be tracking their movements, looking to see how they learn to exploit the sage steppe and the mountains, where they ‘hopover,’ those sorts of things.”

“This wasn’t an easy project; the international permitting in particular was a huge hassle. Identifying a species that would meet our goals and be able to thrive in Wyoming’s strongly seasonal habitat.” added Kauffman. “If we can get these Aussie macropods established and breeding, they are likely to thrive with continued climate change in Wyoming’s already semi-arid climate. Additionally, we believe with their large hind legs, they’ll be able to effectively defend themselves from coyotes, wolves and other predators. Trust me: You don’t want to be kicked by one of these animals.”

Even as they hope for the successful establishment of Wyoming’s newest large mammal, researchers aren’t giving up on the native big game that so many Wyomingite’s cherish. “Research is needed now more than ever to identify and map the critical habitats that migratory big game require,” Kauffman added.

With a successful introduction of kangaroos into Wyoming’s ecosystem, WMI will review other opportunities for the state to be home to other marsupial species. A short-list for future proposed introductions include the koala, wallaby and the endangered Tasmanian Devil.

257,2,0.0,"Sociedade — A grande imprensa tradicional perde espaço a cada dia, principalmente por causa da força das redes sociais que impulsionam mídias alternativas, e isso representa um perigo para os setores que, até então, dominavam a comunicação no país.

Com a popularização do debate sobre ‘fake news’, aqueles que sempre conseguiram manipular a opinião pública encontraram uma forma de atacar novos comunicadores, principalmente no Facebook. E como as redações da velha imprensa possuem, em maioria, alinhamento a esquerda, as vozes da direita se tornaram os alvos.

Em seu Instagram, o deputado Eduardo Bolsonaro informou que páginas de apoio à Jair Bolsonaro, pré-candidato à Presidência da República, foram retiradas do ar.

E adiantou que os donos das páginas em questão irão entrar na Justiça. Veja:

Poucos dias atrás, a página oficial de divulgação das análises sobre política do blog Ceticismo Político, com editorial de direita, também foi retirada do ar após acusações de fake news.

O Movimento Brasil Livre também está sob forte ataque da imprensa que acusa o MBL de espalhar fake news, usando como argumento uma uma pesquisa da USP que sequer existe. Ou seja, usam fake news para acusar outros de fake news.

Em entrevista ao Boletim da Liberdade, o coordenador nacional do MBL Renan Santos declarou que o MBL irá tomar as medidas judiciais cabíveis: “Já estamos com advogado desde a matéria da semana passada que falou que a gente divulgou fake news. Inclusive eles citavam aquele estudo da USP para falar isso. Mas o estudo da USP é fake news da USP. Isso já está com advogado. E não vai ser nem [para pedir] direito de resposta. Já vai para calúnia e difamação direto.”

“Existe uma intenção deliberada do Grupo Globo em atacar a gente. O objetivo final é tirar nossa página do Facebook do ar.”, disse Renan.

Sobre os ataques contra a liberdade de pensamento de setores da direita, principalmente na internet e meios de comunicação, o MBL soltou nota oficial. Leia na íntegra:

“Conforme previsto, a rede de mentiras orquestrada pela esquerda começou a alcançar seus verdadeiros resultados: a censura e a derrubada de páginas de facebook de ativistas de direita e anti-corrupção. Na última semana derrubaram o conhecido site de análises políticas “Ceticismo Político”; nesta, duas páginas de apoio ao deputado Jair Bolsonaro.

O padrão percebido é sempre o mesmo: veículos de credibilidade manchada acusam de fake News aqueles que discordam; “especialistas” ligados ao PT emitem laudos validando a farsa; facebook, sob pressão, retira do ar as páginas vítimas de censura. O artifício também conta com o apoio de setores do judiciário, como prova a atuação estabanada do Ministro do STF Luís Fux ao usar uma notícia falsa para combater notícias falsas.

O MBL também vem sendo alvo desta campanha de censura. O objetivo da grande imprensa é calar opiniões divergentes e devolver o Brasil ao estado de letargia e ruminância que o país se encontrava antes das redes sociais. Éramos presas fáceis de suas novelas defensoras de bandido, de seus jornalistas de DCE e de seus falsos consensos politicamente corretos. Sob sua “cobertura vigilante” estaríamos vivendo em uma ditadura socialistas. Dói-lhes a alma saber que o brasileiro não é gado em seu pasto de mentiras.

Nosso grupo lamenta a censura às páginas que apoiavam o candidato, bem como o abuso cometido contra o Ceticismo Político. Não serão divergências políticas que farão nossa disposição democrática se alterar. Mas fica o alerta: Se os brasileiros de bem não começarem a se mobilizar, muitas outras vítimas virão.”

261,5,0.0,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—As America’s bridges, roads, and other infrastructure dangerously deteriorate from decades of neglect, there is a mounting sense of urgency that it is time to build a giant wall.

Across the U. S., whose rail system is a rickety antique plagued by deadly accidents, Americans are increasingly recognizing that building a wall with Mexico, and possibly another one with Canada, should be the country's top priority.

Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of a Washington-based think tank called the Center for Responsible Immigration, believes that most Americans favor the building of border walls over extravagant pet projects like structurally sound freeway overpasses.

""The estimated cost of a border wall with Mexico is five billion dollars,"" he said. ""We could easily blow the same amount of money on infrastructure repairs and have nothing to show for it but functioning highways.""

Congress has dragged its feet on infrastructure spending in recent years, but Dorrinson senses growing support in Washington for building a giant border wall. ""Even if for some reason we don't get the Mexicans to pay for it, five billion is a steal,"" he said.

While some think that America’s declining infrastructure is a national-security threat, Dorrinson strongly disagrees. ""If immigrants somehow get over the wall, the condition of our bridges and roads will keep them from getting very far,"" he said.

A bookworm’s dream come true, the secluded space—whose name translates to “secret room” in Norwegian—was designed by Studio Padron in collaboration with Smith Design Office as a gorgeous guesthouse for a nearby vacation home. The delightful dwelling comes furnished with everything you need to leaf through a good book: a big, fluffy bed, snug armchair, and, of course, a wall-to-wall selection of reading material. A charming wood-burning stove heats the 200-square-meter space, so you'll always be nice and toasty no matter the weather.

While the inside is warm and welcoming, the exterior is modern and minimalist. The box-like structure features plain walls obstructed only by two large windows and the front door. Painted entirely black, it “strikes a strong figure in the landscape, creating an enigmatic presence in the winter terrain” while simultaneously echoing the trees that surround it. With its sleek design and stark color choice, the contemporary cottage is a unique and surprising forest find.

If Hemmelig Rom's obvious creature comforts and appealing aesthetic weren’t enticing enough, the tiny reading retreat also promotes sustainable construction: the logs that comprise it derive from the oak trees that were cleared to make room for the main house, “preserving and transforming a material that would otherwise have become construction waste.”

With its modern approach to design and construction, cozy amenities, and ideal setting, guests are sure to live happily ever after in this picture-perfect hideaway.

264,1,0.0,"I’ve never lost a close friend to death. My parents and several aunts, uncles, and cousins have passed on, but no one who I would say was an especially close friend. I can only surmise that the death of a family member affects the heart differently from the death of a close friend. Family relationships can be complicated and “messy,” so to speak. We don’t choose our family; we’re sort of “stuck” with them. Some of us may be fortunate to really enjoy the company of our families, but for others it’s painful.

Relationships with our friends are quite different. Typically, we choose our friends. Usually they share our interests, we are comfortable with them, and we may even feel free to share things with them we wouldn’t share with our immediate family, or even with our priest, for that matter. We meet them at school, in our neighborhoods, at Scout meetings, or on a baseball team. Others don’t make close friends until they get into college. Many times, we just gravitate towards each other. The greatest friends are those who, even though we may be separated from them by hundreds and even thousands of miles, and not see them for years, are still as close to us as if we lived next door and talked every day, and when we do get together we take up right where we left off.

Jesus had a close friend, Lazarus. We’re not given the details surrounding their friendship. We know that Jesus dined in his home in Bethany, which was a “Sabbath day’s journey” from Jerusalem. We have more specific details about Jesus’ interaction with Mary and Martha, Lazarus’ sisters, than the content of any conversations between Jesus and Lazarus. The Apostle John in his Gospel, chapter 11, alludes to their friendship. Lazarus fell sick and word is sent to Jesus from Mary and Martha: “Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.” When Jesus receives the news from Lazarus’ sisters, He is “on the road” with His disciples. John writes that “Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.”

When Jesus hears of Lazarus’ illness His reaction is curious. One would think that He would have immediately struck out for Bethany and rushed to His close friend’s side, to lay His hands upon him and banish whatever illness from which He was suffering. Had Jesus not done this for Peter’s mother-in-law and countless men and women who were strangers? Surely, He would do this out of love for His close friend. But instead Jesus, in a somewhat confusing dialogue with His disciples, states that the “sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” Finally, after two days Jesus tells His disciples that it is time for them to go to Bethany, saying, “Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.” Thinking that Jesus was speaking literally of sleep they assume that Lazarus will get better, but Jesus breaks to them the stark news that “Lazarus is dead.” Jesus continues with a strange declaration that He is glad for their, the disciples’ sake, that He was not there, “that you may believe.” I remember as a young boy, reading this passage for the first time, I was confused and not a little distraught. Jesus’ words almost seem callous.

Jesus arrives at Bethany and is greeted by a distraught and weeping Martha. Surrounded by grieving family and friends, Martha begins to rebuke and reprimand Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” On the face of it these words are a stinging indictment against Jesus. But Martha proceeds to utter a profound confession of her faith in Jesus: “And even now I know whatever you ask of God, God will give you.” At first it seems that Martha’s grief is expressed in anger against the one who she thought loved her brother Lazarus and could have spared him from death. Jesus declares to Martha, “Your brother will rise again.” And in response Martha states her belief in the final resurrection. Jesus then speaks the words that should be on all our lips and in our heart: “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he dies, he shall live; and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.” Profound words indeed, but just words nonetheless.

Martha calls for her sister Mary, who comes quickly to Jesus, a crowd following her. Reaching Jesus, she falls at His feet and with profuse tears repeats the same stinging words as Martha: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” John states that Jesus was overwhelmed by Mary’s grief and the weeping of the crowd, and can no longer contain His grief and He likewise begins to weep. Why is our Lord weeping? Is it only because He is moved by the grief and despair around Him? Or, does He know something about death and what Lazarus may be experiencing at that very moment? What we do know is that “He is deeply moved in spirit and troubled,” and this causes Him to ask to see the tomb where Lazarus lies. On the way even the crowd begins to raise questions about Jesus: “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”

When they reach the tomb, Jesus asks that the stone be removed. Martha protests that by this time Lazarus’ body would be exuding a very unpleasant odor, since he was now dead for four days. Jesus insists, and the stone is removed. Jesus lifts His eyes and prays, “Father, I thank You, that You have heard me. I knew that You hear me always, but I have said this on account of the people standing here, that they may believe You sent me.” Then with a loud voice Jesus cries out, “Lazarus, come out!” As the crowd looks on they see the outline of a man coming out of the tomb, and then in full daylight they see Lazarus bound with grave-clothes, at which Jesus orders them to unbind him.

A wonderful miracle, one that the troparion for the day says is a “confirmation of the universal resurrection.” However, while the raising of Lazarus is the central theme of the pericope, for me the most moving parts of this Gospel reading are the very deep and profoundly human emotions expressed by our Lord Jesus Christ. Ironically in the first centuries of the Church, the overwhelming majority of heretical teachings refused to acknowledge the full humanity of our Lord. In the last century the opposite has been the case: our contemporary society refuses to confess His divinity. It has been my experience as a priest that many Orthodox laypeople find it hard to relate to the Lord and embrace His full humanity. It is in this story of Lazarus, together with his sisters Mary and Martha, that clearly shows us the genuine depth of the human experience of our Lord Jesus. He is moved to the very core of His humanity when confronted with the death of His friend Lazarus and the profound grief and sense of loss experienced by his sisters and friends. It is this Jesus who I turn to in my daily existence, in the times of my greatest joy and depths of my deepest pain and despair. It is this Jesus who I know weeps with me as I weep, because He experiences WITH me my greatest heartaches. It is this same Jesus who on Thursday of Great Week will pray that His Father take from Him the Cup.

During times of loss, in which the darkness of despair swallows us up and we feel most alone, we can turn to this human Jesus who, while never separated from His divinity, has experienced the very same human emotions that we confront and has been tempted with the same burning temptations we face, knowing that He offers no condemnation of us but rather His loving and comforting arms and flowing tears WITH us and FOR us.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Kazakhstan’s National Bank is taking a very hard-line approach toward the regulation of digital currency — or cryptocurrencies — in an effort to prohibit its exchange for Kazakhstan’s national currency, the tenge, and every type of cryptomining, Chairman of Kazakhstan’s National Bank Daniyar Akishev told Sputnik on Friday.

""In Kazakhstan, the National Bank is taking very conservative approach toward the matter, and it welcomes nothing but extremely tough restrictions.

""We minimize the risks related to the national market. However, no central bank has all the instruments to control this market in the cross-border market. Therefore, at least, we must prevent this risk via the national currency,"" he stated.

Akishev noted that one of the major risks was the use of cryptocurrencies to commit illegal acts.

""The digital currencies are an ideal instrument for money laundering and tax evasion,"" he explained, adding that the central bank’s harsh stance against digital currencies was supported by the majority of Kazakhstan’s state bodies.

271,2,1.0,"Lumeajustitiei.ro a intrat in posesia unei citatii din care reiese ca judecatoarea Maricela Cobzariu de la Sectia penala a Inaltei Curti, investita sa judece dosare de rasunet ale DNA, a fost chemata sa se prezinte la parchetul anticoruptie . . Acest fapt poate fi de natura sa intimideze judecatorii din dosarele DNA, si poate fi comparat cu o situatie nepermisa de lege, aceea ca partea adversa din dosar (partea acuzata) si-ar permite sa invite judecatorul la o actiune de-a sa ori sa aiba intalniri de orice natura.

Si mai surprinzator ni se pare faptul ca din citatie rezulta ca procurorul care instrumenteaza dosarul in care a fost citata Cobzariu este Corneliu Iuliu Natavala (foto), care, atentie, a fost adus la DNA in octombrie 2017 (cu doua saptamani inainte de citarea judecatoarei Cobzariu), iar potrivit fisei sale profesionale la data aducerii lui la DNA avea doar 2 ani de la numirea sa in functie prin decret prezidential ca procuror la Parchetul Judecatoriei Sectorului 3 Numai ideea ca un procuror cu doi ani vechime de la numirea in functie poate audia un judecator de Inalta Curte pare una contra naturii, fiind evident ca intr-un timp atat de scurt, oricat de talentat ar fi un tanar, el nu poate avea experienta necesara instrumentarii unor dosare complexe de coruptie. Mai mult, la PJS3 tanarul procuror nu a instrumentat decat dosare marunte (furturi de masini, furturi intre soti, furtisaguri in mijloacele de transport, dosare rutiere etc). Astfel, recrutarea unor incepatori la DNA nu ofera garantiile de profesionalism ridicat si experienta pe care le presupune o functie de executie in parchetul anticoruptie.

Faptul ca DNA isi poate permite sa citeze la audieri judecatori care solutioneaza dosarele acestui parchet releva de ce este atat de necesara intrarea in vigoare cat mai rapid a Sectiei de investigare a infractiunilor comise de magistrati, gandita in Legile Justitiei care au fost adoptate in urma cu cateva zile de Camera Deputatilor si Senatul Romaniei.

In prezent, Sectia de investigare a infractiunilor comise de magistrati din DNA este de asemenea condusa de o procuroare adusa de la Parchetul Judecatoriei Buftea, vestita Florentina Mirica, cu care Kovesi se duce de mana la CSM de aproape doi ani, timp in care Sectia de procurori a CSM tot trage de timp sa dea o solutie in dosarul disciplinar deschis lui Mirica pentru sifonarea unor informatii secrete din dosarul DIPI-Oprea.

-In adresa nu se precizeaza calitatea in care Maricela Cobzariu a fost chemata la DNA, ci doar faptul ca prezenta acesteia era necesara in dosarul penal nr. 476/P/2017 instrumentat de Sectia de combatere a coruptiei din cadrul parchetului anticoruptie.

Lumeajustitiei.ro a incercat sa verifice la DNA autenticitatea informatiei si un lucru extrem de simplu, pentru care am adresat conform legii o solicitare verbala, prin telefon, purtatoarei de cuvant Livia Saplacan, careia i-am cerut sa ne spuna doar atat: in ce calitate a fost audiata Maricela Cobzariu si in legatura cu ce fapta? Caci poate Maricela Cobzariu a fost audiata ca martor, poate in alta calitate, insa chemarea unui judecator care solutioneaza dosare DNA este chemat la DNA reprezinta un subiect de interes national.

Desi, potrivit legii, Livia Saplacan trebuia sa ne raspunda de indata, sau in maxim 24 de ore, daca datele cerute prin solicitare verbala sunt mai complexe, nu am primit niciun raspuns pana la acest moment, chiar daca a trecut mai mult de o zi. Culmea, in cursul zilei de marti 27 martie 2018, imediat dupa ce i-am adresat solicitarea verbala, Livia Saplacan ne-a cerut sa-i trimitem si in scris intrebarea pe adresa de e-mail. Ceea ce si am facut la scurt timp. Surpriza, purtatoarea de cuvant ne-a raspuns ca ne va da informatia in termen maxim de 30 de zile. Asta desi art. 8 alin. (5) din Legea 544/2001 privind liberul acces la informatii de interes public prevede ca: “Informatiile de interes public solicitate verbal de catre mijloacele de informare in masa vor fi comunicate, de regula, imediat sau in cel mult 24 de ore”.

Avem banuiala ca DNA se codeste sa recunoasca faptul ca trimite citatii judecatorilor care solutioneaza rechizitoriile acestui parchet, pentru a nu fi suspectat legitim ca pune presiune pe instantele de judecata. Asemenea practici sunt similare, in opinia noastra, cu cele folosite in cunoscutul proces Kovesi-Antena 3, despre care recent Inspectia Judiciara a considerat ca adresa DNA trimisa la ultimul termen poate fi calificata drept o imixtiune in activitatea de judecata.

Tanarul procuror Corneliu Iuliu Natavala a avut un parcurs educational si profesional foarte cuminte, de la finalizarea liceului, in 2007, si pana in 2017, cand a fost numit procuror la DNA. A absolvit toate scolile pe care le-a facut cu medii de 9 si 10, iar cum a ajuns la DNA i-a fost pus in brate cel putin un dosar cu greutate.

274,1,0.0,"There’s an important conversation going on right now about the power that companies like Facebook wield over our lives. These businesses are built on technology platforms that are so complex, it’s unreasonable to expect users to fully understand the implications of interacting with them. As a user of the internet, you deserve a voice and should be able to use the internet on your own terms. In light of recent news on how the aggregation of user data can be used in surprising ways, we’ve created an add-on for Firefox called Facebook Container, based on technology we’ve been working on for the last couple of years and accelerated in response to what we see in terms of growing demand for tools that help manage privacy and security.

The pages you visit on the web can say a lot about you. They can infer where you live, the hobbies you have, and your political persuasion. There’s enormous value in tying this data to your social profile, and Facebook has a network of trackers on various websites. This code tracks you invisibly and it is often impossible to determine when this data is being shared.

Facebook Container isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of your web activity. When you install it, you will continue to be able to use Facebook normally. Facebook can continue to deliver their service to you and send you advertising. The difference is that it will be much harder for Facebook to use your activity collected off Facebook to send you ads and other targeted messages.

This Add-On offers a solution that doesn’t tell users to simply stop using a service that they get value from. Instead, it gives users tools that help them protect themselves from the unexpected side effects of their usage. The type of data in the recent Cambridge Analytica incident would not have been prevented by Facebook Container. But troves of data are being collected on your behavior on the internet, and so giving users a choice to limit what they share in a way that is under their control is important.

Facebook isn’t unique in their practice of collecting data from your activity outside of the core service, and our goal is not to single out a particular organization, but to start with a well-defined problem that we can solve quickly. As good privacy hygiene, it’s also worth reviewing your privacy settings for each app that you use regularly. With respect to Facebook, this link from EFF has useful advice on how to keep your data where you want it to be, under more of your control.

To learn more about how our Facebook Container Add-On works, check out our Firefox Frontier Blog.

275,1,0.0,"Our Multi-Account Containers extension has been a game changer for many users, letting them manage various parts of their online life without intermingling their accounts. To help Firefox users have more control of their data on Facebook, we’ve created the Facebook Container Extension.

This extension helps you control more of your web activity from Facebook by isolating your identity into a separate container. This makes it harder for Facebook to track your activity on other websites via third-party cookies.

Rather than stop using a service you find valuable and miss out on those adorable photos of your nephew, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can collect about you. That includes us: Mozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We only know the number of times the extension is installed or removed.

When you install this extension it will delete your Facebook cookies and log you out of Facebook. The next time you visit Facebook it will open in a new blue-colored browser tab (aka “container tab”). In that tab you can login to Facebook and use it like you normally would. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.

Should you click on any Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs it will load them within the Facebook container. You should know that when you’re using these buttons information will be sent to Facebook about the website that you shared from.

If you use your Facebook credentials to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials, it may not work properly and you may not be able to login. Also, because you’re logged into Facebook in the container tab, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook container tab will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity. So it may look different than what you are used to seeing.

There’s a lot of value in your social data. It’s important to regularly review your privacy settings on all sites and applications that use it. The EFF has useful advice on how to keep your data where you want it to be, under more of your control.

This wasn't a data breach, no one hacked into Facebook or stole passwords. It happened because Facebook allowed apps to access not just sensitive information of people who used those programs – but their friends as well.

Facebook said it’s taken steps to “limit developer access to detailed friend data”, but Facebook’s current default settings leave a lot of questions and a lot of data flying around. One thing is clear though: Facebook needs to step up and respect its users.

279,2,1.0,"O ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva foi recebido por uma multidão na cidade de Palmeira das Missões (RS) na noite desta quinta-feira (22), encerrando o quarto dia da etapa sul da caravana Lula pelo Brasil. Ao lado de representantes de movimentos sociais, da presidenta eleita Dilma Rousseff e demais dirigentes do PT, o ex-presidente relembrou as políticas públicas sociais que transformaram o Estado e o país nos últimos 12 anos e afirmou que está pronto para voltar a governar o Brasil.

""A única razão pela qual eu quero ser candidato é que eu tenho certeza que posso consertar de novo esse país. Se preparem porque eu tenho uma energia que eles não imaginam. Estou muito mais motivado agora"", anunciou Lula, sob os aplausos da população palmeirense que lotou a praça Alfredo Westphalen.

Durante o ato, Lula voltou a pedir que os juízes se debrucem sobre o mérito de seu processo e exigiu justiça. ""Eu não sou melhor do que ninguém. Não estou acima da lei. O que eu quero é só justiça. Se eu tiver uma mínima culpa, eu direi ao PT: 'eu não mereço ser candidato'. Agora, já estão há quatro anos futucando a minha vida e não acharam nada"", disse.

Sobre as medidas para que o Brasil retome o crescimento, Lula destacou que a inclusão do povo pobre na economia é a principal saída. ""Quando o povo tem emprego, um salário um pouquinho melhor, ele começa a comer melhor, a comprar um imóvel novo, a ajeitar a casa"", explicou o ex-presidente, lembrando que em seu governo o país teve um crescimento de 7,5% no PIB e 12,5% no varejo.

""A coisa estava tão boa, que descobrimos o Pré-Sal, não por sorte, mas por fruto de trabalho e pesquisa. E decidimos que o Pré-Sal seria o passaporte para o futuro deste país, com os royalties investidos na educação"", declarou Lula, orgulhoso por ter se dedicado para resolver o problema da educação no Brasil e incluir o filho do pobre na universidade.

Os investimentos em educação durante os governos do PT refletem diretamente na vida da população de Palmeira das Missões. Graças à expansão da rede federal dos governos Lula e Dilma, a cidade ganhou o campus Palmeira das Missões da Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, inaugurada pelo ex-presidente. No total, foram 426 bolsas do ProUni concedidas, 484 contratos pelo FIES e 923 matrículas no Pronatec. No transporte escolar, foram 19 ônibus para área rural e 1 para alunos com deficiência.

""Por tudo isso colocamos 4 milhões de jovens nas universidades em 12 anos, contra 4 milhões em todo século 20"", reforçou Lula, que citou também a importância de programas como o Minha Casa Minha Vida e Bolsa Família, que atendeu 1.771 famílias de Palmeira das Missões, um total de 7,1 mil pessoas beneficiadas.

Nesta sexta-feira (23), a caravana Lula Pelo Brasil segue para Passo Fundo, onde o ex-presidente visita a Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul. Em seguida, Lula participa de um ato em São Leopoldo.

283,1,0.0,"A brigada antifraude da polícia israelense acusou formalmente de corrupção o primeiro-ministro Benjamin Netanyahu, de 68 anos, nesta terça-feira. Os policiais — que investigaram o chefe de Governo e pessoas próximas a ele durante cerca de dois anos e o interrogaram em seis ocasiões — recomendaram ao Ministério Público acusá-lo por suborno por ter embolsado um milhão de shekels (cerca de 1,018 milhão de reais) em presentes de luxo, e por conflitos de interesses por suas relações com o proprietário de um grupo de comunicação. Netanyahu, que parecia esperar o anúncio policial desde a semana passada, negou ter sido subornado e afirmou que permanecerá no cargo.

“A polícia concluiu que há provas suficientes contra o primeiro-ministro para acusá-lo por aceitar subornos, fraude e abuso de confiança”, afirmou um comunicado oficial dos serviços policiais. Em Israel é comum que os agentes divulguem publicamente suas conclusões e suas recomendações de acusação antes de encaminhá-las ao Ministério Público e à magistratura, que são os que finalmente formulam as acusações e o processo, se for o caso. Em 60% dos casos, a Justiça não segue as propostas de acusação feitas pela polícia, como lembrou na terça-feira a imprensa israelense.

“Essas recomendações não têm valor jurídico em nenhum país democrático”, disse Netanyahu na televisão. “Continuarei a governar Israel com responsabilidade e compromisso”, proclamou o primeiro-ministro, que durante as investigações e interrogatórios repetiu como um mantra que “não haverá nada, porque nunca houve nada”, dando a entender que as investigações têm pouca consistência.

A ministra da Justiça, Ayelet Shaked, afirmou que o primeiro-ministro não é obrigado por lei a renunciar depois da acusação da polícia. O Tribunal Supremo israelense havia rejeitado na segunda-feira uma petição de partidários do primeiro-ministro para proibir a polícia de recomendar acusações contra altos funcionários, informa a agência Efe. O Tribunal Superior disse que não encontrou razões legais para “interferir nas ações da polícia”. Netanyahu se reuniu na noite passada com seus advogados para preparar sua estratégia de defesa.

O Lahav 433, a unidade contra o crime organizado da polícia israelense, equivalente ao FBI, aumentou durante o ano passado o cerco aos dois casos de corrupção que envolve Netanyahu, que está à frente do Governo desde 2009.

A polícia age com notável independência em Israel. Por causa de suas investigações, o ex-presidente do Estado judeu Moshe Katsav foi condenado em 2010 por estupro e agressões sexuais e ficou preso durante cinco anos. As investigações também contribuíram para manter atrás das grades durante mais de 14 meses o ex-chefe de Governo Ehud Olmert, considerado culpado de crimes de corrupção imobiliária por uma decisão final em 2016, e que teve de renunciar ao cargo em 2009.

287,1,1.0,"As configurações de privacidade do Facebook são um labirinto. Você precisa ficar de olho nas opções para reconhecimento facial, para os anúncios, e para cada aplicativo conectado — especialmente após o caso Cambridge Analytica.

É tanta coisa que até o próprio Facebook fica perdido. A Wired descobriu que uma opção de privacidade não faz nada há anos, mas ainda está disponível. Ela envolve um recurso desativado em 2014.

Para acessá-la, abra o Facebook e vá em Configurações > Aplicativos (ou acesse facebook.com/settings?tab=applications). Então, no campo “Aplicativos que outras pessoas usam”, clique em Editar. Aqui, é possível restringir as informações sobre você que seus amigos fornecem para aplicativos, jogos e sites.

Sim, seus contatos podiam repassar dados referentes a você, incluindo data de nascimento, cidade atual, interesses e curtidas. Foi assim que o teste de personalidade “thisisyourdigitallife”, usado por 270 mil pessoas, coletou dados sobre 50 milhões de usuários que foram vendidos para a Cambridge Analytica.

No entanto, isso deixou de acontecer em 2014. Desde então, aplicativos do Facebook não conseguem mais obter dados de todos os seus amigos (apenas os seus).

“Na época, a funcionalidade ‘Aplicativos que outras pessoas usam’ permitia ao usuário controlar quais informações poderiam ser compartilhadas com os desenvolvedores”, explica um porta-voz do Facebook.

“Alteramos nossos sistemas anos atrás para que as pessoas não pudessem compartilhar informações dos amigos com os desenvolvedores, a menos que cada amigo também desse permissão explícita”, diz a empresa.

Talvez você não acredite na palavra do Facebook, mas a mudança foi confirmada pelos pesquisadores Gergely Biczok e Iraklis Symeonidis, que estudam há anos a privacidade na rede social. A Graph API 2.0, lançada em 2014, já não tinha mais a permissão “user_friends” para os desenvolvedores acessarem dados dos seus amigos.

“Talvez seja apenas um erro no processo de desenvolvimento de software”, diz Biczok à Wired, “mas está aí há muito tempo”.

O Facebook não conseguiu se explicar, e apenas disse que vai atualizar as configurações para “refletir nossas práticas atuais” nas próximas semanas.

290,1,1.0,"Produções originais da Netflix não vão mais poder concorrer a um dos mais prestigiados festivais de cinema do mundo: o festival de Cannes não vai mais considerar filmes da Netflix em sua premiação.

De acordo com o The Hollywood Reporter, o Festival de Cannes só aceita filmes que passam em salas de cinema. E como a Netflix não distribui suas produções para os cinemas, elas não podem mais concorrer ao prêmio.

Filmes produzidos pela Netflix sempre estreiam primeiro na plataforma de streaming, embora em alguns casos a empresa também distribua produções para algumas salas de cinema simultaneamente.

No ano passado, duas produções da Netflix chegaram a ser indicadas ao prêmio: ""Okja"" e ""Os Meyerowitz: Família Não Se Escolhe"". Após protestos de cineastas franceses contra a Netflix, a empresa tentou exibir os filmes em salas de cinema por ao menos uma semana, mas acabou não conseguindo permissão para isso.

A partir de agora, filmes da Netflix não vão mais ser considerados na hora de definir candidatos ao prêmio. ""O pessoal da Netflix adorou o tapete vermelho e adoraria estar presente com outros filmes.

294,1,,"President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill into law at the White House on Friday, narrowly avoiding a government shutdown, despite concerns it was full of what he deemed wasteful programs.

“I was thinking about doing the veto,” Trump told reporters. “But because of the incredible gains that we’ve been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our thinking.”

The president read a laundry list of multi-billion dollar weapons purchases included in the bill, rattling off battleships, warplanes and submarines. However, many of the programs he listed by name have been plagued with cost overruns, programmatic delays and the very taxpayer waste that he criticized.

The F-35 fighter jet. The KC-46A aerial refueling tanker. The P-8A Poseidon submarine-hunting jet.

“We’re very proud of many of the items that we’ve been able to get,” Trump said. “We’re very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things where we consider in many cases them to be bad or them to be a waste of money. But that’s the way unfortunately right now the system works.”

The more than 2,200-page bill includes nearly $700 billion for the military and $591 billion in non-defense spending. At least $2.9 billion of that money will be invested into what’s known as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.

The radar-evading fighter jet, manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp., has been beset by problems since it first began in 2001. It has been delayed by glitches in its onboard computer systems, cracks in structural components and even bugs with the pilots’ high-tech helmets. The price tag, meanwhile, has nearly doubled to more than $400 billion for 2,456 jets.

Robert Behler, the Defense Department’s director of operational testing, said in an annual report released in January that there are about 1,000 unresolved deficiencies with the aircraft nearly two decades after it started.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and frequent critic of defense spending abuse, once called the F-35 program “both a scandal and a tragedy” and a “predictable consequence of a broken defense acquisition system.”

It took the Air Force three attempts and a decade to begin replacing its fleet of 415 Eisenhower Administration-era refueling tankers. The process, which also began in 2001, failed two times amid accusations of underhanded politics and discriminatory rule-making.

Boeing Co. was finally declared a winner over rival Northrop Grumman Corp. for the $35 billion contract in 2011, yet the planes still aren’t operational. The spending budget has set aside $510 million in taxpayer money for three KC-46A tanker aircraft, despite the chagrin of military leadership with the program.

U. S. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson laid out the concerns Tuesday during testimony with the House Armed Services Committee.

“One of our frustrations with Boeing is they’re much more focused on their commercial activity than on getting this right for the Air Force and getting these aircraft to the Air Force,” she said. “And that’s the message we took to them in Seattle last week. We have asked them to put their A-team on this to get these problems fixed and get this aircraft to the Air Force.”

Boeing has amassed around $2 billion in charges on the program related to delays and cost overruns. The P-8A Poseidon, another Boeing-made plane, has also been criticized although to a much lesser degree. The program previously had deficiencies anti-submarine warfare and wide area reconnaissance capabilities, two of its main missions.

William D. Hartung, director of the arms and security project at the Center for International Policy, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, said the cost and performance problems with programs like the F-35 and KC-46 are notorious and shouldn’t be overlooked.

“If the President wanted to talk about waste he should have referenced the ramping up of these programs, which are clearly not ready for prime time,” Hartung said. “What’s not clear is whether the president has any sense of the strategic value of any of the items he reeled off, or a sense of whether the programs in question are well managed.”

Defense Secretary James Mattis, who appeared alongside Trump at the White House, said it was “the largest military budget in history, reversing many years of decline and unpredictable funding.”

Most military spending has been capped for the past few years under budget controls meant to rein in government debt. Trump blamed this on the Democrats but, in fact, it was Republicans’ doing.

In July 2011, now-House Speaker Paul Ryan locked his veteran Budget Committee staff director, Austin Smythe, in a room for 48 hours with his aides and had them rewrite the 1985 Budget Control Act that first created the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester. That modified bill became the $1.2 trillion end-of-the-year spending-cut threat that is caused the GOP so much grief as the nation annually hung on a fiscal cliff.

The new infusion of cash gives the military invites waste and abuse, according to critics like Hartung, because it’s more money than the Pentagon can absorb. But to arms manufacturers and the defense industry, it is a welcome reprieve after the many years of living under the sequester.

John Luddy, vice president for national security policy at the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents the defense industry on Capitol Hill, said in a statement that the bill was “a big step in the right direction” for the Pentagon.

“It makes significant investments in vital acquisition programs and provides necessary flexibility on operations and maintenance spending, he said. “To meet the strategic objectives outlined in the National Defense Strategy, we’ll need to continue to increase investment for at least the next five years.”

296,1,,"As fronteiras entre realidade e ficção ruíram neste fim de semana com a estreia da série “O Mecanismo” na Netflix. A série que se inspirou na Operação Lava-Jato para denunciar o maior esquema de corrupção política do Brasil foi atacada neste sábado (24/3) por um site denunciado justamente por receber dinheiro de propina dos indiciados na investigação da Polícia Federal.

O site Brasil 247 definiu a série como “criminosa” e está em campanha contra José Padilha, exigindo um pedido de desculpas da Netflix pela produção.

“É criminosa a série ‘O Mecanismo’, lançada pela Netflix na antevéspera do que seria a prisão do ex-presidente Lula”, diz um dos muitos textos não assinados publicados pelo site nas últimas horas. “Embora diga ser baseada em fatos reais, a série é uma coleção de preconceitos e ‘fake news’. Entre as cenas mais grotescas, dirigidas pelo brasileiro José Padilha, o doleiro Alberto Youssef frequenta o comitê da campanha do PT, a presidente Dilma Rousseff grava um pronunciamento eleitoral sobre como ‘estocar vento’ e o ex-presidente Lula diz a Michel Temer para não se preocupar com os ‘açougueiros’ da JBS”.

Entretanto, ao contrário do filme “Polícia Federal: A Lei É para Todos”, a série não identifica nenhuma pessoa real com os nomes citados nessa reclamação.

O texto ainda diz que vai ensinar “como protestar junto à Netflix” e em seguida publica o telefone do serviço de atendimento aos clientes da plataforma.

Apesar de não ser assinado, o texto abre aspas para dar voz – e identidade – a um suposto leitor indignado, Alexandre Mendes Santos, que define a série como “lamentável”, especialmente por dizer que “o maior problema do Brasil é a ‘corrupção'”. Ao final, ele conclama “os companheiros” a exigir “da diretoria da empresa um pedido de desculpas à imensa maioria dos brasileiros e brasileiras que foram ultrajados na pela (sic) série de Padilha”.

Outros textos similares foram publicados, dando vozes a internautas indignados, que dizem que Padilha é “pior que coxinha” e a série é “fake news”. “Fake news”, por sinal, é usado como slogan vazio, repetido várias vezes na cobertura do site, embora a série, obviamente, seja… uma série. Para ser mais didático: série não produz fake news porque não é noticiário. Já site…

Segundo o delator da Operação Lava Jato, Milton Pascowitch, o site da Editora 247, representada pelo jornalista Leonardo Attuch, que foi alvo de condução coercitiva da PF, recebeu dinheiro do esquema de corrupção da Petrobras. Em despacho, o juiz Sérgio Moro identificou que o apoio do site Brasil 247 teria sido comprado pelo ex-tesoureiro do Partido dos Trabalhadores, João Vaccari Neto. Às vésperas do impeachment, Dilma Rousseff ainda firmou um contrato de RS$ 2,1 milhões com o site.

Antes de fundar o Brasil 247, Attuch foi alvo de investigação da Operação Satiagraha, acusado pelo jornalista Mino Pedrosa de usar seu cargo e função na revista IstoÉ Dinheiro para defender o banqueiro Daniel Dantas e o investidor Naji Nahas, também denunciados por corrupção, por meio de… “fake news” – a expressão é usada aqui de forma anacrônica, já que só virou slogan após ser popularizada por Donald Trump no ano passado.

297,1,,"Muito antes da 'República de Curitiba', protagonizar a Operação Lava Jato, a linha do novelo que expôs o maior esquema de corrupção do País começou a ser desenrolada em Londrina, a cerca de 400 quilômetros da capital paranaense.

Foi lá que o delegado Gerson Machado, 6 anos anos da Lava Jato ser deflagrada, reuniu provas contra o doleiro Alberto Youssef e informações de que um posto em Brasília (que curiosamente não tem lava jato) era usado para lavar dinheiro.

Gerson é Marco Ruffo, interpretado pelo ator Selton Mello, e Alberto Youssef é Roberto Ibrahim, na atuação de Enrique Diaz, em O Mecanismo, criada pelo diretor José Padilha - diretor de Ônibus 174 e Tropa de Elite - e dirigida em parceria com Elena Soares.

Inspirada no escândalo, a série que estréia nesta sexta-feira (23), mostra como uma linha foi puxando a outra em um roteiro no qual os fios já renderam mais de 40 fases na investigação e continuam a surpreender os brasileiros.

A trama, embora tenha nascido de uma experiência real que tem ajudado a definir politicamente a vida dos brasileiros, traz personagens como Verena Cardoni, uma policial federal interpretada pela atriz Carol Abras. Não há uma figura equivalente a ela no roteiro da vida real. Justamente por isso, a série consegue envolver quem está assistindo e fazer com que o fio da meada não se perca, como ocorre com quem acompanha a operação apenas pelo noticiário.

A angústia dos personagens é um ponto essencial para atingir o que parece ser um dos objetivos da série: mostrar que a corrupção não tem partido nem lado.

Os primeiros episódios focam no esforço de Ruffo em provar que Ibrahim está envolvido em algum esquema de corrupção, inicialmente não há ligação explícita com a política, o mesmo que ocorreu entre Gerson e Youssef.

Apesar de não ter conversado com Selton Mello para elaboração do personagem, Gerson, segundo Padilha, diz que a rotina dele era bem parecida com a do personagem. ""Ele tentava a todo custo mostrar que havia algo errado, mas era acusado de perseguição"", diz o diretor.

Gerson foi obrigado a se afastar das investigações, entrou em depressão e se aposentou aos 49 anos. No ano seguinte ao que deixou a Polícia Federal, a Lava Jato foi às ruas.

O Mecanismo integra a lista crescente de produções originais da Netflix no Brasil, que inclui a série Coisa Mais Linda, 3%, Samantha!, O Matador, Laerte-se, além dos especiais de comédia estrelados por Felipe Neto, Marco Luque, Clarice Falcão, Rafinha Bastos e Edmilson Filho.

298,1,,"Novidade que promete agitar o público ligado na Netflix, a série brasileira “O Mecanismo”, feita com base nos desdobramentos da Operação Lava Jato, já tem continuidade garantida na plataforma de streaming.

De acordo com o jornalista Fernando Oliveira, do jornal “Agora SP”, a produção, dirigida por José Padilha, mesmo diretor de “Tropa de Elite” e “Narcos”, está com a segunda temporada praticamente fechada.

Pesou para decisão o fato de que a produção, que explora os meandros das investigações políticas promovidas pela Polícia Federal, surgir em um momento propício no país, onde as pessoas criam expectativa e curiosidade ao tema.

Por ora, executivos da plataforma acham que a série, cuja primeira temporada estreou nesta sexta-feira (23), tem tudo para emplacar. Para uma nova leva de episódios, é esperada a permanência de Selton Mello no elenco.

299,1,,"O MB esteve semana passada na coletiva de lançamento da série O Mecanismo no Copacabana Palace. Esta é a segunda produção nacional da Netflix, a série é uma criação de José Padilha (Tropa de Elite 1 e 2, Narcos e o remake de RoboCop) e da roteirista Elena Soarez (Cidade dos Homens), e será lançada globalmente pela Netflix nesta sexta (23/03).

O MB teve acesso aos 3 primeiros episódios, Lava Jato, Halawi e Ventos frios vindos do Sul, o piloto dirigido por José Padilha, e os outros dois por Felipe Prado. A produção é de ótimo nível, com direção e fotografia excelentes (Azul Serra e Lula Carvalho). A trilha sonora de Antonio Pinto também é excelente, e ajuda a dar o clima da série. Ele é o compositor de Cidade de Deus, além de vários filmes internacionais. O curioso é que ele também foi o compositor do filme Lula, o Filho do Brasil, que tem uma postura bem diferente da série O Mecanismo.

Uma boa série começa por um roteiro bem escrito, e O Mecanismo vai muito bem neste quesito, mostrando o lado humano dos seus heróis e também dos vilões, cutucando poderosos incluindo ex-presidentes e o vice que tomou o trono, e especialmente mostrando o drama particular de Ruffo ao tentar prender seu amigo de infância, o doleiro que cuidava de todo o esquema.

O elenco conta com Selton Mello e Enrique Diaz afinados como a dupla de antagonistas. Carol Abras também está ótima como a agente federal Verena. Na coletiva de lançamento, feita um dia depois do assassinato de Marielle Franco, o tema inevitavelmente veio a tona. Para Jonathan Haagensen, a morte dela foi emblemática, mas infelizmente só mostra o que acontece diariamente nas comunidades, especialmente com mulheres negras.

Na entrevista, José Padilha também falou muito de política e corrupção, mostrando como o dinheiro é a graxa que movimenta toda a engrenagem. Para ele, um dos maiores problemas para se desmantelar o mecanismo no Brasil é que por aqui a ideologia fica em segundo plano perto dos imensos lucros, de todos os lados. A série procura ser isenta, e já começa citando os principais partidos políticos envolvidos no funcionamento do mecanismo.

É interessante acompanhar nas soluções para contar uma história inspirada em fatos reais no Brasil, depois da experiência de Padilha gravando a série Narcos na Colômbia. No final das contas, a julgar pelos 3 primeiros episódios, O Mecanismo parece um filme nacional, mas digo isto como um elogio. Um daqueles muito bons, com roteiro bem escrito e ótimo ritmo, algo que o diretor sabe fazer muito bem. Agora é esperar até amanhã para conferir os próximos episódios. Eu confesso que já fui fisgado pela trama.

300,1,,"Produzir conteúdo audiovisual sobre eventos, especialmente eventos políticos, que, de uma forma ou de outra, ainda estão em andamento, é uma tarefa ao mesmo tempo corajosa e arriscada, especialmente se levarmos em consideração o mundo polarizado em que vivemos, com lados entrincheirados, aguerridos e prontos para boicotar obras e vociferar contra tudo que não compartilha de suas respectivas ideologias. É uma pena que isso aconteça, mas isso de forma alguma significa que eventos presentes – ou pelo menos recentes – não devam ser convertidos em obras de ficção, sejam de um lado ou de outro do espectro político.

O Mecanismo, produção brasileira do Netflix capitaneada por José Padilha, cuja primeira colaboração nos trouxe Narcos, dá um tratamento ficcional, em sua primeira temporada, ao começo da Operação Lava Jato, com base no livro Lava Jato: O Juiz Sergio Moro e os Bastidores da Operação que Abalou o Brasil, de Vladimir Netto. Padilha, mestre em abordar a história brasileira recente, sabe transformar um texto árido e potencialmente moroso (sem trocadilho) em um thriller policial interessante e aterrador que de forma alguma tenta esconder – e nem deveria – seu posicionamento político. O viés é de exaltação da operação capitaneada pela Polícia Federal (aqui Federativa) de Curitiba, com personagens que se aproximam muito dos originais, com apenas mudanças de nomes – por vezes jocosas e caricaturais como Dilma Roussef ser Janete Ruscov e Michel Temer ser  Samuel Themes – e situações que espelham de maneira eficiente os meandros ou “mecanismos” da corrupção no Brasil, algo que o roteiro deixa muito claro que não é novidade e nem exclusividade daqueles retratados na série.

Os roteiros dos episódios, todos escritos por Elena Soarez, são para lá de didáticos, com repetições infindáveis que batem na mesma tecla monocórdia praticamente a todo capítulo como o “combater o câncer não deixa ninguém incólume” e coisas assim. Mas existe uma razão para isso, ainda que não absolva seus textos: a série é brasileira, mas foi feita para ser “vendida” para o mundo todo, assim como são todas as séries produzidas pelo Netflix. Portanto, assim como outras séries fortemente politizadas como a terrível Marseille, os eventos são compassadamente explicados em seus mínimos detalhes, até porque, para muito país por aí, os meandros da podridão que envolve doleiros, estatais, empreiteiras e diretamente o governo e toda a base política é coisa de ficção científica, pelo menos no grau de amplitude e de profundidade com que isso se fincou no Brasil basicamente desde que Cabral chegou por aqui.

Mas a nojeira histórica também não pode servir de salvo conduto para o lodaçal do presente ser perpetuado e a operação Lava Jato – a verdadeira ou a ficcional – tem seu papel importante na tentativa de se colocar o país novamente nos trilhos. O que realmente espanta nos roteiros de Soarez, sendo seu verdadeiro e principal ponto positivo, é como a autora deixa claro, nas entrelinhas, que esse “mecanismo” não é unicamente algo criado da cabeça de políticos bandidos ajudados por empresários mais bandidos ainda. Ao contrário, de maneira elegante e discreta, Soarez coloca a culpa em nós, brasileiros, em nossa cegueira em compreender que aquilo que fazemos de errado no dia-a-dia – desde jogar lixo na rua, passando por parar em vagas de idosos “só por um minutinho”, entrar no vagão de mulheres no metrô “sem querer”, até dar um “dinheirinho” para policiais para não levar multa e muito mais – é a base para a roubalheira em larga escala que estamos vendo a céu aberto hoje em dia. Tenho certeza que muita gente discordará dessa afirmação, mas é justamente a discordância sobre esses aspectos pequenos que vemos acontecer toda hora que se transforma em negligência ao ser encarada com naturalidade e “parte da vida”, desaguando na postura simplista do “eles é que são corruptos, eu não!”. Basta parar e pensar para ver que o famoso “jeitinho” é a raiz de um ciclo vicioso inquebrantável.

O mérito do roteiro, porém, acaba sendo diluído não só pelo didatismo exacerbado representado pelas narrações em off, como também pela quantidade de chavões e frases de efeito que Soarez insere na narrativa, algo que obviamente ecoa a base dos bem sucedidos Tropa de Elite, mas que, aqui, cansa pela repetição, ainda que o “Fez merda, né? Bom, vamos comigo que a gente vai desfazer essa merda.” e o “Quem é que foge para Brasília?” sejam memoráveis.

No campo das atuações, Selton Mello mais uma vez mostra que é um dos melhores atores brasileiros de sua geração, mesmo considerando sua irritante incapacidade de falar para fora, marca registrada sua desde os primórdios que torna a compressão do que ele balbucia bastante complicada (santa legenda!). Mas ele realmente está bem como o obsessivo e completamente perturbado delegado da policial federal Marco Ruffo (o avatar do delegado Gerson Machado) que, em 2003, consegue finalmente prender seu colega de infância e doleiro infame Roberto Ibrahim (Enrique Díaz encarnando a versão da série de Alberto Youssef), somente para ver o trabalho de sua vida desfeito pela sana justiceira do Ministério Público.

Aqui, a série faz algo inesperado e, em uma elipse de 10 anos, nos arremessa de 2003 para 2013, agora com a delegada Verena Cardoni (Caroline Abras como o avatar da agente Erika Marena) não só no comando da nova versão da operação, como também no protagonismo efetivo da série até seu fim. Foi uma escolha arriscada, mas Abras mostra firmeza interpretando sua personagem, mesmo que por vezes pareça muito “dura”, talvez em função de um roteiro que não lhe dê lá muito espaço interpretativo.

Quem realmente, porém, se destaca é mesmo Enrique Díaz, em atuação que imediatamente me lembrou a de Robert Knepper como T-Bag, em Prison Break, ou seja, um bandido safado e cafajeste moldado para que o odiemos, mas ao mesmo tempo que o amemos. Chega a ser uma incongruência, mas é um daquele prazeres inevitáveis que volta e meia temos que encarar e aceitar no cinema e na televisão. Díaz é o grande destaque da temporada, mastigando o cenário em todas as cenas em que aparece, mesmo quando contracena com Mello.

Em termos estruturais, a série é como seu roteiro: burocrática. São tomadas externas com câmera parada intercaladas com internas da mesma forma, às vezes com arroubos de movimentação que não acrescentam dramaticidade à narrativa além de um fim em si mesmo. Não é nada que desabone a série, mas também não lhe traz qualquer qualidade efetivamente destácavel, parecendo que a fotografia principal foi feita na correria. O mesmo vale para a direção de fotografia em si que usa filtros chapados, fazendo com que as sequências – independente do lugar onde se passam – sejam quase que completamente iguais, diferenciadas apenas pelas legendas “geográficas” e pelos establishing shots aéreos de cada cidade.

O Mecanismo é uma série com potencial, mas que não é plenamente realizado aqui. Ela incomoda? Certamente. É feita para isso, especialmente quem se recusa a aceitar a existência do problema e quem defende seus políticos de estimação. Portanto, inevitavelmente, ela cumpre sua função e o boicote de certas pessoas que preferem não encarar tudo que contrarie seu posicionamento político só ajuda seu IBOPE. É torcer para que Padilha saiba isolar o que a primeira temporada teve de bom e caprichar de verdade na próxima. Pois material é o que não falta, infelizmente…

301,1,,"A história estava ali, contada no livro de Vladimir Netto, mas não bastava colar a realidade no ecrã e filmá-la. Era preciso ir além de “Lava Jato — Os Bastidores da Operação Que Abalou o Brasil e o Mundo” (ed. Desassossego, a lançar no início de abril) e dar um olhar diferente ao trabalho do jornalista brasileiro, que tinha feito “uma pesquisa bastante extensa sobre a Lava Jato”. Quando José Padilha convidou Elena Soarez para o projeto, tudo o que havia era um livro, mas depois de Padilha ter feito “Narcos” ambos sabiam que isso não chegava para o que tinham em mãos.

Não foi fácil construir uma narrativa televisiva e ficcional a partir da realidade e Elena Soarez gostava de ter tido mais tempo para dar forma a “O Mecanismo”. “Só não foi mais demorado porque não podia”, conta a cocriadora ao Expresso, considerando que teve “muito pouco tempo” para criar o argumento. “A investigação em si, ela é ingrata do ponto de vista narrativo porque ela vai abrindo, tem um desenho de leque.” A investigação começa “com um pequeno grupo de goleiros, depois vamos para diretores de estatais e a seguir para empreiteiros, que já são muitos, até chegar aos políticos, que são quase todos”. Elena lembra que “essa gente toda não cabe na tela”, pelo que foi necessário recorrer “a uma série de simplificações e reduções com o objetivo de construir uma estrutura narrativa”. “O grande desafio foi esse: fazer o equilíbrio entre realidade e ficção, entre política e entretenimento.”

Apesar do desafio de pegar numa investigação ainda em curso e trazê-la para a televisão, Elena Soarez considera que tem “uma certa margem de segurança” no seu trabalho. “A primeira temporada termina na sétima parte da investigação e só para ter uma ideia essa semana a investigação completou a sua 49ª fase, então por esse lado eu estou mais ou menos coberta, o que não impede que uma vez ou outra eu tome um susto.” O risco vale a pena, considera a argumentista, que vê em “O Mecanismo” a oportunidade de contar de contar uma história próximo do tempo em que ela acontece na realidade. “Se eu estivesse contando essa história passado muito tempo, eu estaria contando essa história do ponto de vista dos vitoriosos porque essa é a versão que fica na história”, mas não é isso que acontece aqui. Na série da Netflix, que nasceu de uma proposta de Padilha ao serviço de streaming, a história é contada “de todos os lados, com todas as vozes”, o que acaba por dar um fôlego maior à narrativa. “Está tudo em aberto”, reafirma Elena Soarez.

Ao tratar “uma história que tomou o país de assalto” e que “rachou a sociedade civil ao meio”, levando as posições a extremarem-se, Elena apostou tudo na construção de algo que revele a realidade sem tomar um lado. Aqui não há esquerda e direita — “Nós nos esforçamos para que ambas odeiem e elas odiarão, porque queremos justamente nos retirar desse debate ideológico”, frisa —, pelo que a receita de “O Mecanismo” é mostrar que a corrupção “é uma prática no Brasil desde sempre e que não é monopólio de nenhum governo, seja ele de direita ou de esquerda”. “É uma perversa associação entre capital e poder que se retroalimenta, financiando interesses privados em detrimento de interesses públicos, em detrimento do bem comum.”

Embora considere que o Brasil passou “por situações muito traumáticas recentemente”, Elena Soarez acredita que todo este processo teve também um lado bom. “Eu acredito que a perda da ilusão é o lado bom; é melhor saber do que não saber”, considera, e é também essa a sua missão. “Acho que a realidade brasileira tem nos servido um excesso de histórias, pelo que a dificuldade atualmente é filtrá-las. São tantas... Nesse momento de crise, mais do que nunca, a gente faz a nossa parte nessa área do entretenimento, mas a realidade brasileira está cheia de histórias para contar.”

A aposta num assunto que é “profundamente brasileiro e local” pode parecer arriscada, quando o objetivo é alcançar público de todo o mundo, mas a cocriadora de “O Mecanismo” acredita que o facto de a corrupção ser “um assunto mais ou menos universal” pode levar a que “as pessoas se conectem com ele”. Por outro lado, também o lado ficcional chamará outros públicos para a série. “Investimos muito na ficção das personagens”, garante Soarez a propósito das mais de 100 personagens diferentes de “O Mecanismo”, que ainda assim se centra num núcleo mais restrito. Selton Mello é Marco Ruffo, um antigo delegado da Polícia Federativa, e Carol Abras interpreta Verena Cardoni (a ajudante de Ruffo), ao passo que Enrique Diaz dá vida ao criminoso Roberto Ibrahim.

A primeira temporada de “O Mecanismo”, composta por oito episódios, já está disponível em streaming na Netflix, mas a segunda leva de episódios ainda não foi anunciada. À pergunta direta do Expresso sobre a existência de novos capítulos seguiu-se um silêncio, que passados alguns momentos Elena Soarez quebrou. “Vocês têm essa expressão em Portugal de que quem cala consente? É isso.”

302,1,,"Um ministro tinha ficado de levar a avó na aeróbica, o outro não estava podendo e todos estavam, sei lá, meio cansados; o feriadão emendado de dez dias (por lei) a que a corte tem direito já a partir de hoje provavelmente não seria suficiente para que seus integrantes se recuperassem de uma jornada noite adentro. Melhor dar um tempo. Depois da Páscoa a gente volta. Desse jeito, José Padilha não tem mesmo como errar: vi os três primeiros episódios de O Mecanismo ontem à noite, amargurando mais esse dia desajuizado, e foram redobradas a frustração e a exasperação na sequência – muito bem montada, aliás, com controle perito do ritmo – em que Roberval (Giulio Lopes), superintendente da PF no Paraná, faz o que pode para melar a operação simultânea em três cidades da delegada federal Verena (Caroline Abras). A cada novo desenvolvimento (por exemplo, os agentes federais que vão comer um lanchinho no bar e deixam o alvo escapar), Roberval ameaça: “Vou cancelar!”. Ou anuncia: “Melhor parar!”. Ou, ainda, repreende: “Não é assim que se faz!”. A esta altura da nova série de Padilha para a Netflix (disponível na íntegra a partir de hoje), ainda não sei se Roberval está a soldo de alguém, se é negligente ou se é meramente um tipo acovardado que não quer balançar o barco – ou todas as três coisas, o que é provável. Só sei que Roberval não quer fazer o trabalho pelo qual o contribuinte lhe paga. Isso, a delegada Verena também sabe. Tanto que, para conseguir fazer seu trabalho, Verena tem de esconder do chefe um dos alvos da operação. Ele não trabalha, e também não quer – ativamente e com empenho – que ela trabalhe. Padilha sabe tomar o pulso do Brasil e diagnosticar seus males como nenhum outro. Em caso de dúvida, basta rever Tropa de Elite, que já completou dez anos de idade, à luz da intervenção no Rio de Janeiro; se tivesse sido lançado esta semana, não poderia ser mais pertinente. Mas não é só a visão de Padilha que conta. Parte do que faz sua dramaturgia ressoar com a plateia é isso, seu talento para criar na tela brasileiros tão vivamente autênticos quanto Roberval. Sejam quais forem os motivos do superintendente da PF, o seu modus operandi é velho conhecido seu, meu e nosso. Todo dia, quase sem falha, há um Roberval no meio do caminho do cidadão.

Em O Mecanismo, PF quer dizer “Polícia Federativa”, e não “Polícia Federal”. Todos os nomes e siglas foram trocados. Mas todos são igualmente velhos conhecidos do espectador, desde que o escândalo do Mensalão estourou, em 2005, e por vias tangenciais acabou desembocando na Operação Lava Jato. A série começa antes, em 2003, quando o delegado federal Marco Ruffo (Selton Mello) pega o doleiro Roberto Ibrahim (Enrique Diaz) com a boca na botija, mas é obrigado a deixá-lo escapar. Ruffo é o único personagem central inventado especificamente para fins dramatúrgicos. Você não vai ter nenhuma dificuldade em identificar Ibrahim, ou o juiz Rigo, o diretor da “Petrobrasil” João Pedro Rangel, a presidente Janete, a refinaria de Antonio & Lima, a empreiteira Miller & Bretch – e mais uma lista infindável de figuras públicas e outras tantas que foram expostas, dos seus recônditos nos bastidores, para o noticiário. Acho um tantinho óbvio demais o uso de “Bichos Escrotos”, dos Titãs, na trilha, mas não há como negar que casa bem com o enredo (a trilha original de Antonio Pinto, aliás, é excelente).

Nesses três primeiros capítulos, a tese central de O Mecanismo – a de que o Brasil é uma engrenagem de corrupção que gira, expande-se e se perpetua em todos os níveis, em todos os governos – ainda está sendo delineada, e não sei dizer com quanta garra ela será defendida até o oitavo e último episódio. Acredito que com muita garra: com seu estilo caracteristicamente propulsivo estabelecido desde o primeiro episódio, Padilha, assim como nos Tropa de Elite e em Narcos, tem uma capacidade notável de organizar uma narrativa que se desdobra em múltiplas frentes sem nunca deixar a peteca cair (e é preciso fazer justiça ao roteiro muito bem estruturado de Elena Soarez, que escreveu também Cidade dos Homens, Xingu e a pequena joia que é Vida de Menina). Padilha e os outros diretores da série – Felipe Prado e Marcos Prado, que produziram os dois Tropa de Elite com ele, e Daniel Rezende, de Bingo – são craques na tensão também, e às vezes O Mecanismo é de roer as unhas: mesmo quando se sabe qual o desfecho que determinado evento teve na verdade, sente-se aquela crença irracional de que, se na ficção ele terminar de outro jeito, talvez então a história real possa ser reescrita, com as devidas e infelizmente tão distantes correções.

Em uma dura crítica publicada, o veículo afirmou que a série é criminosa e está sendo usada como campanha partidária, chegando a afirmar que a série ganhou incentivo de partidos.

“É criminosa a série ‘O Mecanismo’, lançada pela Netflix na antevéspera do que seria a prisão do ex-presidente Lula. Embora diga ser baseada em fatos reais, a série é uma coleção de preconceitos e ‘fake news’. Entre as cenas mais grotescas, dirigidas pelo brasileiro José Padilha, o doleiro Alberto Youssef frequenta o comitê da campanha do PT, a presidente Dilma Rousseff grava um pronunciamento eleitoral sobre como ‘estocar vento’ e o ex-presidente Lula diz a Michel Temer para não se preocupar com os açougueiros da JBS”.

Além disso, o site convida os assinantes da Netflix a cancelarem o serviço de streaming – confira!

‘O Mecanismo’: Série sobre a Lava-Jato estreia na Netflix

Em entrevista ao CinePOP, o diretor José Padilha confirmou que a série é baseada na Lava-Jato, e afirmou: “Não tem assunto no Brasil que não tenha corrupção!”.

Assista nossa entrevista com o diretor e o elenco:

A série é inspirada em acontecimentos reais do Brasil e que impulsionaram o maior escândalo de corrupção de todos os tempos. A história retrata como um pequeno grupo de obstinados investigadores desvenda um monstruoso esquema de corrupção no Brasil e o impacto dessa descoberta em todos os envolvidos e neles próprios.

O elenco conta com Selton Mello, Carol Abras, Enrique Diaz, Lee Taylor, Antonio Saboia, Jonathan Haagensen, Alessandra Colasanti, Leonardo Medeiros, Otto Jr. e Susana Ribeiro.

Em 23 de Março, todo o esquema será revelado.

305,4,,"José Padilha tem uma longa escalada política em sua carreira como cineasta. Virou uma espécie de “especialista”, dito assim por quem analisa o cinema. Ele utiliza fatos recentes sociopolíticos nacionais e os adapta livremente. Assim com Ônibus 174, os dois Tropas de Elite e a recente série Mecanismo, que estreou nessa sexta-feira (23) na Netflix, produção original. Nessa, ele utiliza como base o livro Lava Jato: O juiz Sergio Moro e os bastidores da operação que abalou o Brasil e cria uma obra episódica com oito partes que remonta de uma maneira mais abrangente e didática a Operação Lava Jato e a sua importância política para o atual cenário no Congresso Nacional do Brasil.

O protagonista da série é Selton Mello, que interpreta o agente da Polícia Federal Marco Ruffo, que está investigando de maneira independente um esquema de lavagem de dinheiro envolvendo um doleiro, chamado de Roberto Ibrahim. Sua investigação, no entanto, não acontece por conta de um forte esquema de revés político que Ibrahim manipulou, colocando Ruffo fora da jogada por um tempo, até que Ibrahim fosse novamente investigado, dessa vez, como alvo da inicial Operação Lava Jato, que desvendou em suma, mas não totalmente, um forte esquema de propina e corrupção envolvendo políticos, donos de empresas estatais e empreiteiras. Supracitado, Padilha desenvolve por gosto obras de cunho político e contexto social e por isso, assume uma identidade enviesada e a insere dentro de suas narrativas sem premeditar uma reação. No entanto, ao aderir a esse ponto mais pessoal, o criador da série se apropria de um discurso próprio comum e parte em cima desse posto para configurar uma análise/crítica perante, como o nome da série viabiliza, o mecanismo que está intrínseco a atual conjuntura política.

Ao indicar que José Padilha entrega um tom pessoal, isso parte do pressuposto de suas próprias considerações sobre essa conjuntura e cenário político, feitas pelas entrevistas que deu para fazer a divulgação da série. E como constatado, ele segue duas vertentes tóxicas bastante conflitantes: ao mesmo que tempo que subestima seu público, entregando um texto insosso, óbvio e completamente fundado em canonizações de órgãos e determinadas fábulas e prerrogativas próprias sobre o esqueleto corrupto da política nacional, como por exemplo, fazer alusões de seus personagens às pessoas reais, como o ex-presidente Lula, o juiz Sérgio Moro e até mesmo o dono da Petrobras – que na série é chamada de Petrobrasil -, usando contextos semânticos de pura higienização e sustentação positivista para alguns e maleficiando outros. Claro que dados os fatos históricos, há de se saber quem possui culpa ou não sobre determinados crimes, mas esse tópico mais real é majoritariamente maquiado, sendo trocado por uma condução maniqueísta da leitura de senso comum.

Marco, o personagem de Selton, acresce uma interessante construção para a narrativa quando seu personagem está justamente distante dessa caçada e desses irrompes vingativos, partindo de uma constatação parcial. Ruffo é um policial complexo, duplamente complexo na verdade e que mostra essas características ao se montar com feitos da vida pessoal, como a perda de confiança da família e principalmente dos ex-colegas policias, sendo a mais fiel Verena (Carol Abras), a personagem com melhor construção narrativa de toda obra. Desfocalizada dessa cegueira parcial e emotiva, Verena coloca o dever como policial acima de qualquer coisa, mas sem se entregar para um foco de justiça dentro do sistema de análise popular. Ela é objetiva e tem em seus próprios motivos, um arquétipo estabelecido de maneira coerente, mesmo que às vezes tenha que se banhar para o texto enviesado, mais parecendo uma coqueluche do que é dito e interpretado como ações de um “cidadão de bem”.

Padilha tem uma mira bem comum dentro de suas últimas obras, mesmo que seja um interesse idealizador técnico. Sua câmera é quase documental, passando uma análise – nesse campo – mais objetiva e em segundo plano. O problema é que o próprio criador subverte esse contexto e passa a demonstrar uma subjetividade e uma clara manifestação própria para com os acontecimentos. Essa mira vermelha tem um nome bem claro: corruptos. A corrupção é identificada em O Mecanismo como um “câncer” (palavras de Ruffo, repercutidas por outros personagens), que se alastra se não for remediado logo de imediato. Claro que este não é uma simples doença, ela tem uma origem muito mais endêmica e anterior a toda esse recente conjuntura e por consequência, os desmembramentos das resoluções. Mas como a liberdade existente da série permitiu que ela focasse somente em um evento que, de fato, desequilibrou a política na Capital Federal, O Mecanismo tratou de idealizar um cenário de salvação e canonização dessas mesmas resoluções.

Algumas palavras de efeito utilizadas por personagens, como o próprio Marco e outros dentro da série, tentam dar à Operação um ar de revolução sistêmica dentro desse esquema. No entanto, as falhas começam justamente dentro desse discurso de desconsiderar um materialismo fatual para ser contraposto a uma iniciativa parcial. A todo momento, a narrativa de O Mecanismo tenta ser equilibrada com esse tom, buscando uma forma de se apresentar como isenta e imparcial, justamente para ser considerada apenas um retrato de evento histórico. Por tentar tanto, a série da Netflix constrói um pouco de seu caminho próprio mas é barrado quase logo em seguida por essa atenuação e constante idealização do cenário. Paulo Rigo (Otto Jr.) é a personificação do juiz em cheque e foco do livro, Sérgio Moro. A partir dessa apresentação, a obra poderia ser dissecada em dois seguimentos: mostrar a presença e os feitos do juiz de Curitiba em uma construção mais sóbria e fria ou o pondo em um altar santificado e o fazendo ser considerado uma espécie de justiceiro. Falha como uma representação dos fatos históricos recentes da política nacional e também falho ao não conseguir ser equilibrada no sentido de se abster de um viés.

Vale ressaltar que o cinema, o setor audiovisual nunca devem ser distantes da política, até porque ela não se resume à corrupção, feitorias para população ou viabilização partidária. A política é um valor histórico e social, que acompanha a sociedade de acordo com o rumo dela e por consequência, a cultura e as obras que são criadas por ela possuem essas considerações. No entanto, ao assumir um panfleto e uma identidade dentro dessas obras, a coerência necessariamente precisa ser estabelecida e um debate a ser criado e discutido à priori. Subestimar o público apresentando uma cartilha de ideias e apresentá-las como principal cerne e chave de uma questão política é atestar que foi falho em fazer essa construção periodista. Novamente, Padilha parece ser um criador de ideias turvas e que são analisadas como inconcebíveis e errôneas se não seguirem sua passionalidade e contestação singular.

Muitos brasileiros ficaram furiosos com a mentiras propagadas pela série O Mecanismo e decidiram cancelar sua assinatura da Netflix como forma de protesto; um dos maiores críticos de cinema do Brasil, Pablo Villaça foi um dos que suspenderam sua conta; nas redes sociais, boicote à empresa ganha força; ""Fiquei horrorizada com essa série monstruosa e mentirosa lançada pelo asqueroso Padilha, pela Netflix. Minha assinatura está cancelada. Amo meu país. Não posso concordar com uma aberração dessas. Consciência, coerência e princípios democráticos são fundamentais"", diz uma das mensagens enviadas ao 247 sobre o assunto

247 - O lançamento da série O Mecanismo, na Netflix, revoltou muitos dos assinantes do serviço, que já entram em contato com a empresa americana exigindo um pedido de desculpas ao Brasil. Nas redes sociais, várias pessoas já anunciam que estão cancelando a assinatura da Netflix por conta da produção. Pablo Villaça, um dos mais importantes críticos de cinema do Brasil, é um dos que suspendeu sua conta.

Dirigida por José Padilha, famoso pelo filme Tropa de Elite, a série deliberadamente tenta prejudicar a esquerda brasileira. Lançada no que seria a antevéspera da prisão do ex-presidente Lula, a produção diz ser ""ser baseada em fatos reais"", mas é uma coleção de preconceitos e ""fake news"".

Entre as cenas mais grotescas, o doleiro Alberto Youssef frequenta o comitê da campanha do PT, a presidente Dilma Rousseff grava um pronunciamento eleitoral sobre como ""estocar vento"" e o ex-presidente Lula diz a Michel Temer para não se preocupar com os ""açougueiros"" da JBS.

Confira abaixo algumas das manifestações do assinantes da Netflix enviadas ao 247:

Hoje eu desisti definitivamente em assinar a Netflix ao qual estava estudando em fazê-lo, justamente pois assisti o primeiro capitulo dO Mecanismo. Vocês deveriam pedir é DESCULPAS AO POVO BRASILEIRO já que dizem que a série é baseado em fatos reais, mas pelo que vejo é uma bela propaganda contra o PT, mostrando mentiras em seus textos. LAMENTÁVEL A POSIÇÃO DESTA EMPRESA EM PLENO ANO ELEITORAL. Em minha opinião deveriam retirar de vez do âmbito desta empresa esta série PROPAGANDA.

Fiquei horrorizada com essa série monstruosa e mentirosa lançada pelo asqueroso Padilha, pela Netflix. Minha assinatura está cancelada. Amo meu país. Não posso concordar com uma aberração dessas. Consciência, coerência e princípios democráticos são fundamentais. Lula tem o respeito de todo mundo civilizado e não merece isso.

FORAAAAAA NETFLIX. RESPEITO AO NOSSO PAÍS! FORA NETFLIX, FORA NETFLIX! RESPEITO AO BRASIL. NOS ERRA,VAZA!

Estou furiosa com a Netflix, com o diretor, produtores e atores, mas qual seria a alternativa fora a Netflix? Temos que buscar e divulgar.

Estou indignada em ver a participação da Netflix nesta manipulação terrível que vivemos nestes últimos anos, não assisto desde 2016 nenhuma emissora de tv no Brasil, cortei Sky porque também continha essas emissoras na grade de programação, então assinei a Netflix e neste momento estou me sentindo totalmente desrespeitada vendo está empresa se rendendo as mesmas mentiras e ódio, irei suspender minha conta caso está série ou outras no mesmo sentido sejam veiculadas através da mesma.

A série O Mecanismo é um crime contra o Brasil e seu povo! Selton Melo perdeu a credibilidade que ele tinha comigo!!

Sobre a série O MECANISMO é falsa só com mentiras , Netflix sua conduta é deplorável.

Por favor, incluam meu nome entre aqueles que se juntam ao Protesto contra a Netflix pela exibição da série Mecanismo.

Fora Temer!

Eu não tenho assinatura no Netflix mas um parente que compartilha comigo a licença, de forma que é permitida, como ainda não se convenceu de cancelar minha saída foi dar dislike.

Quero aqui registrar a minha revolta com a Netflix pela apresentação dessa série ""O Mecanismo"" e a propaganda feita para vendê-la. Estou com vocês. Contem comigo.

Um dos blocos do prédio da Secretaria Regional IV, no Bairro Serrinha, foi queimado por bandidos, que utilizaram bombas incendiárias do tipo coquetel molotov. O fogo destuiu computadores, móveis e equipamentos eletrônicos. As chamas puderam ser vistas do lado de fora do prédio, segundo moradores da região.     A Regional IV comunicou que o atendimento ao público será suspenso até que a situação no prédio seja restabelecida. No local, funcionava os serviços de acolhimento, protocolo e habitação.     O local atingido pelas chamas havia sido reformado e entregue à população no dia 2 de fevereiro deste ano. O órgão informou que o prédio foi periciado e passará por reformas.     Além da Regional, suspeitos também atacaram a tiros o prédio do 19º Juizado Especial Cível e Criminal de Fortaleza, no Bairro Itaperi. As marcas de balas ficaram pelas paredes da unidade, mas ninguém ficou ferido.                Um dos ônibus incendiados na noite deste sábado em Fortaleza.

Em meio ao recente desenvolvimento na tecnologia de veículos não tripulados, a Agência Federal de Transporte Rodoviário da Rússia está a prestes a revelar os primeiros resultados de seu projeto para demonstrar o desenvolvimento de capacidades de infraestrutura e de veículos sem motoristas.

O chefe da Rosavtodor (Agência Federal de Transportes Rodoviários da Rússia), Roman Starovoyt, anunciou que a agência iniciará testes de veículos autônomos neste outono e no inverno, informou a mídia local.

Starovoyt notou que a infraestrutura necessária está sendo instalada nas estradas A-181 “Skandinavia” e “Kazan-Naberezhnye Chelny” para preparar o tráfego sem motorista.

Momento exato em que carro autônomo da Uber atropela mulher nos EUA (VÍDEO)Rosavtodor está atualmente trabalhando em um projeto chamado ""Karavan"", lançado em 2016, para trazer carros autônomos com segurança para as estradas russas. A primeira execução no âmbito do projeto está prevista para maio de 2018 em uma estrada fechada.

A tecnologia está sendo desenvolvida em colaboração com a fabricante de caminhões russa KAMAZ, uma construtora que viu 15 vitórias de seus veículos na categoria de caminhões Rally Dakar. Karavan supostamente envolve especialistas finlandeses do projeto Aurora, que se especializa em testes automatizados e testes de gerenciamento de ativos de infraestrutura.

Atualmente, a tecnologia de veículos autônomos está na mente de todos, já que os gigantes da tecnologia, como Tesla, Uber e Google, lideram o movimento em direção a carros sem motoristas. Muitos fabricantes de automóveis, incluindo a Volkswagen, a BMW, a Daimler e a Toyota, juntaram-se ao esforço.

Recentemente, no entanto, os testes de veículos autônomos sofreram um golpe nos Estados Unidos, depois que um carro autônomo da Uber matou um pedestre que cruzou uma estrada com várias linhas à noite. Alguns acreditam, no entanto, que a tragédia aumentará os esforços para melhorar as tecnologias, softwares, sensores e segurança dos veículos.

331,2,,"A chuva que caiu a tarde inteira na cidade de Chapecó (SC) neste sábado (24) não tirou as milhares de pessoas que ocuparam a Praça Coronel Bertaso, no centro da cidade, para dar as boas vindas ao ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva e sua caravana pelo Sul do país.

O ex-presidente aproveitou o ato em defesa da agricultura familiar na cidade para falar sobre a onda de ódio e violência que grupos de direita estão promovendo contra a caravana Lula Pelo Brasil. ""Esses herdeiros políticos de Hittler e Franco não têm coragem de juntar gente pra fazer um comício a favor do candidato deles. Só podem tentar atrapalhar o dos outros"", declarou Lula, que criticou quem estava jogando ovos em apoiadores do PT. ""Se eles tivessem passado fome uma vez na vida, não estariam tacando ovos nas pessoas. Peguem os ovos que estão tacando e vão para as periferias doar para quem não tem o que comer"", sugeriu.

Lula denunciou que manifestantes da direita tentaram impedi-lo de chegar ao ato em Chapecó e pediu respeito à convivência democrática. ""Queriam me impedir de falar com vocês. Eu nunca vi isso. É como tentar impedir o melhor jogador do Chapecoense de entrar em campo. Como querer tirar o melhor jogador da seleção do jogo? Querem ganhar? Vão disputar as eleições e ganhem no voto"", disparou o ex-presidente.

Durante o ato, Lula relembrou ao povo catarinense que ele e a presidenta eleita Dilma Rousseff foram os que mais fizeram pelo estado. ""Nunca teve um presidente que investiu tanto em Santa Catarina, em Chapecó e na agricultura familiar como nós investimos nos 12 anos de governos do PT"", avaliou o ex-presidente, que acredita ser esse o motivo de tanto ódio da elite contra ele. ""A perseguição não é contra o Lula, e sim pelas coisas boas que o PT fez nesse país. Eles não se conformam por 36 milhões de pessoas terem saído da miséria no Brasil. Não se conformam por termos criado mais de 20 milhões de empregos com carteira assinada durante os nossos governos"".

Lula desafiou novamente seus acusadores a provarem que ele cometeu algum crime. ""Eu desafio eles, o Moro, o Ministério Público Federal e o TRF-4 a provarem que são mais honestos do que eu. Provem uma coisa que eu fiz errado na vida. Se eu tivesse cometido um crime, eu teria de vir aqui pra pedir desculpas a vocês. Mas não. Eu ofereço minha honestidade em troca da confiança que vocês depositam em mim"".

Para barrar os desmontes nas políticas sociais e a retirada de direitos que o atual governo está promovendo no Brasil, Lula disse que irá fazer um referendo revogatório ou uma constituinte ao assumir a presidência da República outra vez. ""O que me deixa indignado é que essa gente tão estudada só sabe fazer corte prejudicando o trabalhador. Se eles não sabem governar, que deixem o torneiro mecânico, que ele sabe"".

Ao encerrar o ato do sexto dia da caravana pela região Sul, Lula pediu à militância e a seus apoiadores para não deixarem o ódio vencer e mandou um recado aos fascistas. ""Não vamos ficar raivosos, o ódio não leva a nada. E fascistas: aprendam a viver em democracia"". Depois das ameaças, o ex-presidente caminhou protegido pelo povo de Chapecó do palco do ato até o hotel, onde entrou pela porta da frente.

Neste domingo (25), a caravana de Lula segue para a cidade de Nova Erechim, onde o ex-presidente participa de um encontro com o sistema cooperado da agricultura familiar.

As disputas políticas e culturais na passagem da caravana do ex-presidente Lula pelo Sul do Brasil não seriam um fato preocupante se estimulassem o diálogo e não o ódio entre os diversos setores. Em uma nação efetivamente democrática, os entes educacionais, a mídia, os movimentos sociais e outros atores políticos da sociedade civil deveriam estar empenhados em promover a reflexão sobre os partidos, sobre as instituições e sobre o contexto político e, assim, poderíamos avançar no pensamento crítico coletivo

O dia da verdade

As balas que atingiram Marielle Franco em 14 de março de 2018, no Rio de Janeiro, são da mesma linhagem da munição que matou Dom Oscar Romero em 24 de março de 1980, em El Salvador. Foram ensinadas, essas balas, a perseguir mulheres e homens que ousam erguer sua voz contra a tortura, o extermínio, o arbítrio e demais violações de direitos humanos praticadas em democracias ainda em construção — ou já em ruína? — como a nossa

Na sexta, 23, o ex-presidente Lula e a ex-presidenta Dilma Rousseff estavam prontos para irem a Passo Fundo quando foram avisados por sua segurança particular de que não seria possível entrar na cidade. É que um grupo de milicianos armados fecharam todas as entradas da cidade com tratores e carros e impediram o direito de ir e vir (...) O que mais impressiona nessa história é que no local tinham policiais e segundo notícias vidas de lá, foram coniventes com toda a agressão e nada fizeram para garantir que dois ex-presidentes pudessem ter seus direitos garantidos. O que leva a crer que o secretário de segurança do estado, Cezar Augusto Schirmer, o mesmo que era prefeito da cidade de Santa Maria quando aconteceu a tragédia da Boate Kiss onde morreram ‎242 pessoas, mais uma vez, não está fazendo nada par impedir que aconteça uma tragédia

Vitória de Lula edifica STF e derrota Globo, Moro e juízes que rasgaram a Constituição

O papel do STF é fazer justiça, cumprir e mandar cumprir a Constituição. Apenas isto e nada mais. A verdade é que o Lula não poderá ser preso, porque ele não cometeu crime. Criminoso é quem o condenou, pois sabedor que esse diabólico processo contra o político trabalhista e de esquerda é uma draconiana mentira. Trata-se de mentira, e da grossa. Ponto

STF não se dobra a pressão da mídia golpista

Apesar do julgamento de mérito do HC ter sido adiado para 4 de abril, por 6 a 5 os ministros decidiram acatar pedido da defesa de Lula e conceder durante este período salvaguarda de locomoção ao ex-presidente Lula. Foi reconfortante ver que o STF está a altura do desafio pelo qual a Nação passa neste momento e que não se dobra à pressão da grande mídia golpista

O STF é só um puxadinho da Midiocracia –  o 4º Poder

Em nenhum país civilizado do mundo, o Tribunal Supremo se rende tanto à Opinião Pública e, pior: à Opinião Publicada como o Brasil. O STF tem se pautado por uma imprensa que é uma vergonhosa atribuição de parcialidade, e que está bem longe de se firmar em qualquer conteúdo democrático da sociedade como um todo, em todas as suas nuances

Polícia não é inimiga

A entrevista concedida ao jornal “El País”, pelo coronel da reserva da Polícia Militar do Rio de Janeiro, Íbis Silva Pereira, deveria servir de ponto de partida para uma profunda reflexão sobre o papel da PM na sociedade. As teses são de alguém que foi capaz de compreender os dilemas que vivem os dois lados nessa guerra civil disfarçada

336,1,,"After fleeing the White House to avoid facing the hundreds of thousands of Americans who took to the streets of D. C. to march against gun violence, Trump spent Saturday afternoon dodging student activists and protesters lining the roads near his Mar-a-Lago resort.

At least 2,000 people were expected to turn out Saturday afternoon for a March for Our Lives event scheduled just miles away from Trump’s luxury resort in West Palm Beach, Florida. The march took participants on the same route that Trump’s motorcade uses to transport him to and from the golf course — setting the stage for Trump to ride right past the activists as he departed Trump International Golf Course.

But instead of facing the protesters, Trump apparently took the “scenic route” home so he could avoid seeing the massive crowds that had gathered to protest his inaction on gun violence.

According to a pool report, “The motorcade traveled a different, longer route back to Mar-a-Lago.”

The White House did not provide an answer when asked why the motorcade had taken a different route. However, the pool report did note that “there have been reports of gun control protests in the area.”

Photos from the area show activists lining the roadside along the usual route, holding signs with slogans such as “Not one more!” and “Fund books, not bullets!”

Sun Sentinel reporter Anne Geggis estimated that 5,000 people took part in the march — more than twice as many participants as expected.

Just weeks ago, Trump claimed that he would run into the line of fire to save students’ lives in a school shooting, even if he had to do it without a weapon.

Today, surrounded by armed guards, Trump was too much of a coward to even show his face to those very same students.

But unfortunately for Trump, he can’t hide forever. The students he went out of his way to ignore today will soon be old enough to vote — and you can be sure they’ll go out of their way to make their voices heard at the ballot box.

339,4,,"This past year I read a book with my daughter called Little House in the Big Woods. You may be familiar with it. It’s the first book written by Laura Ingalls Wilder, and it began the popular Little House on the Prairie series. I don’t recall reading it before, and as I read it to my 5-year-old, I think I enjoyed it even more than her. Something about the way the family lived, it intrigued me. I love my Internet tremendously, but the simplicity and closeness this family shared sounded really wonderful to me. The idea of working together for each other drew me into their little world. Many times as I read the pages aloud I yearned for such a time as the ones described.

I look around today and I wonder if we wouldn’t be better taking a step back in time where we could focus more on important matters, and less on trivial ones. I see the things around me that cause so much unneeded stress, and I truly believe that the principalities and powers of darkness wish to destroy what God has created. God favors families. He favors love, time together, and focus on cultivating those relationships. What I see today is in direct opposition of that, yet those things have developed slowly over time, so much so that we don’t even notice them deteriorating the fabric of family.

Our pre-teens and teenagers are so absorbed in their Snapchat and Instagram that they can’t even come up for air. Not that we notice. We’re buried in our Facebook newsfeed or hottest new game app.

The normalcy of public school education with its ever-increasing curriculum demands are swallowed like good medicine. The school year gets longer, testing increases, and hours of homework creep into the family time. So children that already spend 8-9 hours away from home are spending their evening hours doing more projects, reports, and extra credit assignments.

Mom and dad are too exhausted to help much. They’re tired because they’re putting in more hours. Dual working parents are the majority. And while the cost of living has definitely increased over time, I wonder how much of our “necessities” are truly that? We work more to be able to buy more, yet we hardly have time to enjoy all our purchases. We save all year long for a week-long vacation that leaves us exhausted and in need of a day off from our off days.

A lot of our hard-earned money is spent on activities. So. Many. Activities. We spend more time driving to activities, purchasing gear, costumes, and accessories for our activities, or working on our off days to raise funds for our activities. Activities where we watch other people teach, coach, and mentor our children. Is this the time together we’re craving? Makes you think.

If you had to sit down and add up how much quality time you spend alone with your spouse, what would it be? What about your children? And not time doing and going. Just time. Is it less time than you spend on your weekly commute to work?

It makes you wonder if divorce is more prominent today because it’s become socially more acceptable, or could it be because we’re spending less time enjoying the company of our spouse? Would children get in less trouble if they had a present parent/parents available to guide them? They say it takes a village to raise a child, but I’m wondering if we’ve taken that too far. Now we just want the village to take care of them. And then when our children fall down and fail we can have teachers, coaches, and the church to blame for their demise.

This is hard stuff to think about. It’s taking everything we’ve called “normal” over the past few decades or more and realizing that it’s actually destroying the family unit. Our kids are playing ball 3-5 times a week until 10 p.m., and the parents are working 60 hours a week to keep designer duds on the kiddos lest they get bullied for wearing WalMart brand clothing. Everyone has a TV in their room, a cellphone in their pocket, and a brand new car in the drive-way yet none of that will go to Heaven with us. We’re working very hard providing material possessions for our children when in all reality we should be on our knees with them leading them to a closer walk with Jesus. Eternal life is what we should want for our kids, not the best education money can buy. And while I’m all for giving them a bright future, I don’t want to give them the world if it forfeits their soul. When my grown children look back on life I want them to have memories of time well spent rather than spending all the time. I gotta work on this! I don’t have it all figured out either, but I’d like to think my eyes are open enough to see that Satan wishes to destroy us.

Satan wants us tired, worn thin, and stressed. He wants us in debt up to our eyeballs, and our health failing because we can’t sleep enough, eat right, or handle our stress effectively. He wants husbands and wives fighting over finances, disrespectful teens who learned how to treat their parents based off Nickelodeon sitcoms, and thousands of young children sexually abused by the adults we’re so quick to place our trust in. He wants us busy, but not productive. He wants our plates full, but our tank empty. He wants us looking to society for what’s best for our families, not God’s word as a lamp to our feet. He wants the family unit ripped apart, and many times I look around and see us letting him. We’re not even trying to take a stand.

I’d like to believe that it’s not too late. We can still fight to save our families. Perhaps it all comes down to stepping out in wisdom, courage, and truth for our family. In a world that’s so busy Keeping Up With the Kardashians, maybe it’s time to be a Little House on the Prairie. What do you think?

*Of note, this isn’t meant to offend anyone. It’s just meant to trigger thinking about it. I’m certainly a work in progress.

Pentagon officials had a deadline of Friday to put in place the new policy after months of consideration and court challenges. President Trump followed through late Friday and issued orders to ban transgender troops in all but extremely limited cases.

In August, Trump sent Defense Secretary Jim Mattis a memo ordering him to propose changes to the Obama-era policy that allows transgender troops to serve openly and receive medical treatment, including sexual reassignment surgery.

""I hereby revoke my memorandum of Aug. 25, 2017,"" Trump wrote in a memorandum. ""The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security . . . may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.""

Mattis had given the White House his recommendation on transgender service in February. Without a new policy, the Pentagon would have reverted to its pre-2016 practice that effectively banned transgender troops from service on medical grounds.

Mattis has emphasized the readiness of troops to deploy and fight. In February, the Pentagon established a policy that dismisses troops if they cannot deploy for a period of one year. That principle could affect transgender troops who require medical care that could not be provided in a war zone.

""This latest memorandum is the same cowardly, disgusting ban the president announced last summer,"" Pelosi said. ""No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the U. S. military should be turned away because of who they are. The president's hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor and dignity.""

The Department of Justice said the decision was made ""after comprehensive study and analysis.""

""The Secretary of Defense concluded that new policies should be adopted regarding individuals with gender dysphoria that are consistent with military effectiveness and lethality, budgetary constraints, and applicable law,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The Department of Justice will continue to defend the Department of Defense's lawful authority to create and implement personnel policies they have determined are necessary to best defend our nation.""

Xavier Becerra, the attorney general for California, said his state will fight the ban.

""California will take every measure available to prevent (Trump's) discriminatory action that harms or marginalizes transgender service members — or any other transgender Americans who wish to courageously defend our nation,"" Becerra tweeted.

In July, Trump overturned the policy on transgender troops. He tweeted that transgender troops were no longer welcome in the military, and that the military would no longer pay for their surgeries.

Pentagon leaders reassured transgender troops that they would not be kicked out and that there medical care would not be interrupted until a new policy was created. Federal courts have ruled that transgender men and women must be allowed to volunteer for service. Dozens of transgender recruits have signed up since becoming eligible Jan. 1.

There are believed to be as many as several thousand transgender troops among the active-duty force of more than one million troops, according to a RAND Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon in 2016. Their ability to deploy and cost of medical treatment would have a minimal impact on military readiness, according to the report.

The policy for transgender troops was established in 2016 by then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter. It allows transgender service members to serve openly, seek medical attention and allowed for recruits who have been stable in their gender for 18 months to join the military.

AZ MSZP-DK a paktumuk keretében egyetlen helyen léptetett vissza jelöltet más párt javára, sehol senki mással nem koordináltak még. Az LMP két helyen, a Momentum 3 körzetben húzta vissza jelöltjeit.

Én magam is személyes döntésem alapján jöttem le 2014-ben a listáról, mert láttam, hogy az a Fidesz kétharmadához vezet. Ma látni lehet, hogy ha nincs koordináció, az a Fidesz kétharmadához vezethet. Minden egyes jelölt személyes felelőssége is, hogy meghozza ezt a döntést. Senki nem bújhat a pártja mögé, senki nem bújhat el a felelősség elől a pártja döntésére hivatkozva.

346,1,,"President Trump's gleeful response to the firing of Andrew McCabe raises questions about the motivation behind the senior FBI official's ouster. Lawfare deputy managing editor Quinta Jurecic breaks down the latest in what Trump calls a “witch hunt.” (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)

On March 16, I spent the day with my family waiting to hear whether I would be fired, after 21 years in the FBI and one day before I qualified for my long-planned, earned retirement.

As day turned to night, I had a lot of time to reflect on how it would feel to be separated from the organization I loved — and led — and the mission that has been the central focus of my professional life. Despite all the preparation for the worst-case scenario, I still felt disoriented and sick to my stomach. Around 10 p.m., a friend called to tell me that CNN was reporting that I had been fired. She read me the attorney general’s statement.

So, after two decades of public service, I found out that I had been fired in the most disembodied, impersonal way — third-hand, based on a news account. Shortly after getting word, I noticed an email from a Justice Department official in my work account, telling me that I had been “removed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the civil service.”

I have been accused of “lack of candor.” That is not true. I did not knowingly mislead or lie to investigators. When asked about contacts with a reporter that were fully within my power to authorize as deputy director, and amid the chaos that surrounded me, I answered questions as completely and accurately as I could. And when I realized that some of my answers were not fully accurate or may have been misunderstood, I took the initiative to correct them. At worst, I was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me may well have been confused and distracted — and for that I take full responsibility. But that is not a lack of candor. And under no circumstances could it ever serve as the basis for the very public and extended humiliation of my family and me that the administration, and the president personally, have engaged in over the past year.

Not in my worst nightmares did I ever dream my FBI career would end this way.

The next day I woke to find the president of the United States celebrating my punishment: “Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI — A great day for Democracy.” I was sad, but not surprised, to see that such unhinged public attacks on me would continue into my life after my service to the FBI. President Trump’s cruelty reminded me of the days immediately following the firing of James B. Comey, as the White House desperately tried to push the falsehood that people in the FBI were celebrating the loss of our director. The president’s comments about me were equally hurtful and false, which shows that he has no idea how FBI people feel about their leaders.

I was drawn to the FBI by nothing more complicated than a desire to do good. In 1994, I submitted a special-agent application, dreaming about what life as a criminal investigator would be like. I devoured every book I could find, and binged on news coverage of FBI investigations. When the day came for me to report to the FBI training academy at Quantico, Va., I embarked on the greatest professional adventure I could ever imagine.

Each year, more than 2,000 men and women of all races, colors and creeds are drawn to the FBI by the same professional and personal desire to do good. It is the DNA that we all share. As acting director, I frequently talked to FBI people about that shared DNA as the glue that bound us together and enabled us to stay mission-focused during the chaos that followed Comey’s firing in May 2017. True to form, our agents, analysts and professional staff reacted as FBI people always do. They continued to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution despite the political winds — and the unprecedented attacks on us by the president and other partisans — that buffeted us.

The nation continues to need them. And not just the current employees of the FBI, but all smart, talented, dedicated people considering careers in the law enforcement and intelligence communities. These are hard jobs that demand sacrifice, often involve danger, and take a toll on families and personal lives. But they also offer the rare opportunity to enter into a sacred trust with the American people: to protect and defend them, honestly, justly and fairly. There is no greater responsibility, but there is no greater reward. We cannot afford for young people to be dissuaded from lives of public service by the divisive politics and partisan attacks that now so characterize our national discourse and that, I believe, played a major role in the end of my FBI career.

To those men and women, I say: Fear not. Set the headlines aside and give in to what draws you to this work. The country needs you.

There is nothing like having the opportunity to be a part of the greatest law-enforcement organization in the world, working every day for goals that you respect and cherish. It is the best job you will ever have. Even if a president decides to attack you and your family. Even if you get fired on a Friday night, one day from your retirement.

349,6,,"Era um segunda-feira típica, daquelas que bate até tristeza pelo fim de semana ter acabado. Acordei com enjôo e dor de cabeça, mas como ainda não tinha passado em consulta com o obstetra, estava completamente às cegas em relação à gravidez.

Resolvi ir ao pronto-socorro porque fiquei com medo de sair para trabalhar e passar mal no ônibus ou algo assim. Ninguém do trabalho sabia que eu estava grávida, então tive que avisar minha supervisora com poucos detalhes. Minha amiga que me ajudou com o teste, só sabia o que tinha acontecido naquele dia, mas depois falei que deu falso positivo.

Cheguei, abri a ficha, passei na triagem e fiquei aguardando o médico me chamar. De repente, meu celular toca. Era meu pai contando que minha avó materna tinha falecido.

Apesar de não convivermos tanto (afinal, eu vivo em São Paulo e ela vivia em Passos, Minas Gerais), ela era minha única avó viva e eu tinha boas lembranças dela. Comecei a chorar na sala de espera… Malditos hormônios.

Meu pai ainda não sabia que eu estava grávida. Tenho certeza que ele não teria me ligado naquele momento se já soubesse. Na verdade, a única pessoa que de fato sabia, além do meu marido, era a minha irmã que já é mãe, pois eu precisava muito falar com alguém que pudesse me aconselhar ou pelo menos entender o que eu estava passando.

Entrei no consultório com cara de choro e completamente aérea. Além da tristeza pela perda, estava preocupada com minha mãe, que tinha voltado recentemente da viagem que fez a Minas Gerais para visitar a minha avó no hospital.

Engoli o choro e falei o que estava sentindo. Como não tinha nenhum exame para apresentar, muito menos carteirinha de gestante e mal sabia de quantas semanas eu estava, o médico me colocou no medicamento e em seguida pediu vários exames de sangue e urina e também o primeiro ultrassom. Entrei em choque. Não estava preparada para aquele momento. Sempre achei que meu marido estaria comigo.

Entrei na sala do exame, onde já havia um médico aguardando e uma assistente que veio me trazer o aventalzinho junto com as orientações do procedimento. Eu só respondia “aham”, “ok”, “entendi”. Continuei completamente aérea quando o exame começou, tão aérea que nem estava olhando a TV que permitia acompanhar tudo.

“São dois, viu?”, disse o médico, de repente. Não entendi. Virei para ele e perguntei: “Dois o quê?”. Ele respondeu com a maior naturalidade: “São dois bebês, olha aqui: um feto, dois fetos”.

Minha expressão nesse momento deve ter sido impagável. Parecia pegadinha, fiquei até com vontade de procurar as câmeras escondidas. Incrédula, tive a coragem de perguntar: “Você está me zoando, né?”. QUEM EM SÃ CONSCIÊNCIA VIRA PARA UM MÉDICO E PERGUNTA SE ELE ESTÁ DE ZOEIRA???

Comecei a ter uma crise de riso, o famoso riso de nervoso. Eu não conseguia parar. O médico estava tentando terminar o exame e falando para a assistente as coisas que ela precisava colocar no laudo e eu apenas ria loucamente.

Ele começou a puxar papo, para ver se eu me acalmava. Perguntou se tinha caso de gêmeos na minha família (no caso, minhas irmãs mais velhas são gêmeas), brincou com o riso de nervoso e colocou os coraçõezinhos para eu ouvir… Mas eu estava tão perturbada que não via a hora de sair daquela sala. Precisava de ar.

Quando finalmente saí, fiquei sem rumo. Não sabia o que fazer com aquela informação. No primeiro momento, não queria ligar para meu marido e fazê-lo pensar nisso o dia todo, mas eu precisava dividir isso com alguém. Era ele ou ninguém.

Liguei. Perguntei até se ele estava sentado porque não sabia como reagiria. Ele já tinha saído para almoçar, então falei que contaria depois do almoço, mas ele insistiu em já saber o que era. Eu não sabia como dar a notícia, então acabei falando como o médico falou comigo: “Amor, são dois”. Ele pareceu não entender, ou até assimilou a informação, mas ficou zonzo. Então, repeti mais claramente: “Gêmeos. Dois”. Não lembro muito do fim da ligação, mas foi quase um “Tá, entendi, beleza”. E desligamos.

Fui para a casa dos meus pais ficar com a minha mãe, mas falhei completamente nessa missão, pois como tomei medicamento cheguei lá bem sonolenta e acabei cochilando. Se minha mãe já soubesse, ela entenderia. Mas não queria contar nada até ter a primeira consulta oficial com o obstetra e saber se estava tudo bem mesmo.

Foi uma semana exaustiva. Eu ainda estava tentando assimilar a ideia de que estava grávida, agora precisava me acostumar com a informação de que teria dois bebês. Eu queria externalizar isso logo e tirar todo o peso de mim, só que eu também precisava de paciência para fazer tudo do jeito certo.

351,1,,"‘I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill,’ Trump tweeted Friday morning.

Donald Trump has threatened to veto the omnibus spending bill that was passed by Congress on Thursday, raising the spectre of another government shutdown.

In a Friday morning tweet, the president cited the lack of immigration measures in the $1.3tn budget, which passed the House and Senate on Thursday hours after the 2,232-page text was released to lawmakers and despite opposition from groups on the right and left.

Without new funding the federal government would be partially shut down, a third such closure in months.

Trump’s move was a total reversal from White House statements issued on Thursday. Speaking then at the White House, Mick Mulvaney, the head of Office of Management and Budget, insisted that Trump supported the bill.

“Is the president going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,” Mulvaney told reporters.

The top Trump aide did note that the White House did not consider the omnibus bill to be ideal, as it contained compromises.

“This is what it looks like when you don’t have 60 votes in the Senate and Democrats get to take their pound of flesh,” Mulvaney said.

The bill boosts military spending and takes some actions on gun control but does not include protections for young undocumented migrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers and previously protected under an Obama-era executive order, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or Daca.

The budget does include $1.6bn for barriers on the southern border but it is not authorized to be used on the wall prototypes Trump recently viewed in California. Trump’s presidential campaign made building a wall on the US-Mexico border a signature issue, the candidate repeatedly promising that Mexico would pay for it.

“I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill,” Trump wrote on Friday morning, “based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.”

The DACA program was canceled by Trump in September 2017. However, ongoing litigation has kept protection for many Dreamers in place.

Trump previously rejected a deal with Democrats that would have protected Dreamers in exchange for $25bn for a border wall.

“DACA was abandoned by the Democrats,” Trump tweeted. “Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.”

A senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill told the Guardian: “One of two things will happen. He either signs the bill by the end of the day or he ends up signing a bill he likes even less after Republicans have to renegotiate with Democrats to get out of a shutdown.”

356,1,,"A cargo ship connected to Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell was recently stopped and searched before departing from Colombia. During the search, Colombian Coast Guard agents seized roughly 90 pounds of cocaine.

The drugs were found on the Ping May, which is a vessel operated by the Foremost Maritime Corporation, a company owned by Mitch McConnell’s in-laws, the Chao family. This connection is not only relevant because of the family connection, but also because the Chao family has often made large donations to McConnell’s campaigns.

In fact, the Chao family has been funding McConnell since the late 1980s. Years later, in 1993, McConnell married Elaine Chao and secured the Chao family as one of his primary sources for investments.

A gift worth somewhere between 5 and 25 million dollars from the Chao Family made McConnel one of the richest senators in the country in 2008.

The Foremost Maritime Corporation is currently operating 16 dry bulk cargo ships, most of which are currently still in service.

What makes this case even more interesting is that McConnell is well known as a staunch prohibitionist. In 1996, McConnell sponsored “The Enhanced Marijuana Penalties Act”, a bill designed to increase the mandatory minimum sentencing for people caught with marijuana.

Luis Gonzales, an official with the Colombian Coast Guard in Santa Marta told The Nation that the Ping May’s crew were questioned as part of the investigation, but that they have yet to file any charges in the case.

The war on drugs is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. There are mountains of evidence proving that the biggest importers of harmful, addictive, mind diminishing street drugs is the government. The drug laws that exist do not apply to the government agencies that bring these substances to our country. They are only designed to keep everyone else from this extremely lucrative business and give the establishment another reason to oppress people.

We have seen this all before during alcohol prohibition, where the government, law enforcement and organized crime were all working together and making an unbelievable amount of money in the black market. When black markets are created the crime rate goes up, taxes go up, prices go up and the police become more corrupt, all of this is inevitable. These are in fact the very consequences that any type of prohibition intends to create.

To solve these problems all that we have to do is end all prohibitions, this would cripple the black market and drastically reduce violence. This would also drastically reduce the reach of police and the state in general, which is why it is looked at as such an impossibility. Drug laws don’t do anything to prevent drug problems in our society, they only encourage violence, raise prices and criminalize half of the population.

360,1,,"* Just before President Donald Trump and his lawyer made their boldest appeal yet for the Russia investigation to be shut down, the special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly sent over a list of questions to the president.

* Mueller is still seeking a face-to-face interview with Trump, but the questions are said to be a starting point he wants to use for follow-ups.

* Shortly after, Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, called for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to shut down the Russia investigation and fire Mueller.

Shortly before President Donald Trump and one of his personal defense attorneys made their most brazen calls yet for the Russia investigation to be shut down, they apparently received a list of questions from the special counsel Robert Mueller.

The development comes as Trump's legal team has been working for months to sidestep or significantly narrow the scope of an interview between Mueller and their client, who has shown a tendency to exaggerate the facts and make misleading statements.

According to The New York Times, Trump's tweets this weekend came after Mueller sent the questions as part of his negotiations with Trump's legal team over an interview with the president. Mueller is still seeking an interview, sources told The Times, but sent the list as a starting point that he can later use to ask follow-up questions.

Soon after, Trump embarked on one of his most heated, weekend-long tirades against Mueller, former FBI director James Comey, and former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe late Friday night, hours before he was set to retire with full pension benefits.

On Saturday morning, Trump's personal defense attorney, John Dowd, told The Daily Beast the Russia investigation should be shut down.

""I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,"" Dowd said in a text message, according to the report.

Dowd, who is the primary point of contact between Trump and the special counsel, initially said he was making the statement in his capacity as Trump's attorney, but later walked that back and said he was acting in his own capacity and not on Trump's behalf.

Hours later, Trump blasted out a tweet which echoed Dowd's statement about the ""fraudulent"" Trump-Russia dossier.

""The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,"" he tweeted. ""It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!""

The exact content of Mueller's questions to Trump is unclear. But public reporting and updates from Congress indicate there are a few broad topics that Mueller has inquired about.

Trump is currently the focal point of Mueller's obstruction-of-justice investigation, which stems from Trump's decision to fire Comey last May. Comey and McCabe, both of whom kept detailed memos about their conversations with Trump, are critical witnesses in the obstruction probe.

Mueller is also scrutinizing Trump as he investigates whether his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. In particular, Mueller is said to be looking into whether Trump had any advance knowledge of Russia's hack of the Democratic National Committee and the subsequent dissemination of stolen materials.

The Times reported on Thursday that Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to its efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The revelation could constitute a breach of the ""red line"" Trump said Mueller would cross if the investigation ventured into the Trump family's personal finances.

On Friday, Felix Sater, the Russian-born businessman who acted as an intermediary between the Trump Organization and Russia on the deal, confirmed that the company was actively negotiating with a sanctioned Russian bank to secure financing for the building at the height of the 2016 election.

That same day, Facebook announced that it had removed Cambridge Analytica, one of the two firms the Trump campaign hired to run its data operation, from its platform after it emerged that the firm harvested the personal data of 50 million Facebook users for targeted political advertisements without their permission.

Cambridge Analytica has long faced questions from investigators over its potential engagement with foreign actors, like Russia and WikiLeaks, during the 2016 election. The firm attracted additional scrutiny this weekend, when The New York Times reported that the Russian oil giant Lukoil showed an interest in how Cambridge Analytica used data to target messages toward American voters.

364,1,,"BRASÍLIA — Enquanto o pedido de habeas corpus do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) teve seu julgamento marcado menos de dois meses após ter sido apresentado, o ex-ministro Antonio Palocci aguarda há quase um ano pela análise do seu pedido de liberdade. Os dois casos são relatados pelo ministro Edson Fachin.

Palocci está preso desde setembro de 2016. Lula, por outro lado, fez um pedido preventivo, ou seja, para evitar sua prisão, que pode ser decretada pelo Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região (TRF-4) na próxima semana.

O habeas corpus de Palocci foi apresentado em abril de 2017. Fachin negou o pedido provisoriamente e, em maio, o enviou para ser analisado em plenário. O processo chegou a ser incluído na pauta de novembro, mas foi retirado por Fachin, que não voltou a liberá-lo.

Segundo Fachin explicou na sessão desta quarta-feira, o habeas corpus foi retirado a pedido do advogado do ex-ministro.

O caso de Lula, o habeas corpus foi apresentado no início de fevereiro. Na semana seguinte, Fachin rejeitou o pedido e também o enviou para o plenário. Em março, a defesa recorreu, mas o pedido foi novamente negado pelo ministro. Nessa segunda decisão, ele ressaltou que a responsabilidade para pautar o processo era da presidente do STF, ministra Cármen Lúcia.

Nesta quarta-feira, Cármen anunciou que marcou o julgamento do habeas corpus de Lula para quinta-feira ""pela urgência"".

— Comunico aos senhores ministros e advogados presentes que tendo sido liberada anteontem uma decisão no habeas corpus de relatoria de Fachin e, pela urgência, será apregoado na data de amanhã por não haver possibilidade de pauta anterior, até porque o prazo é curto e semana que vem é Semana Santa — disse.

'URGÊNCIA MUITO MAIOR', DIZ DEFESA

Em petição apresentada na semana passada ao ministro Edson Fachin, revelada pela ""Expresso"", da ""Época"", a defesa do ex-ministro disse que o habeas corpus dele ""possui urgência muito maior"" do que o de Lula.

Os advogados comentaram uma declaração de Cármen, de que a inclusão do processo de Lula na pauta não dependeria dela, mas sim de Fachin.

""Ora, se o habeas corpus preventivo independe de inclusão em pauta, parece óbvio que o caso do paciente possui urgência muito maior, na medida em que a prisão processual perdura por quase dezoito meses"", escreveu.

A defesa pediu para Fachin tomar a iniciativa de levar o habeas corpus para julgamento na sessão desta quarta-feira ou na de quinta-feira.

367,2,,"Se todos os 11 ministros do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) permanecerem fieis ao que vêm decidindo em meses recentes, o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva deve ter uma vitória por 6 a 5 na sessão desta 5ª feira (22.mar.2018).

A Corte vai julgar 1 habeas corpus preventivo para Lula. Trata-se de uma ação que pede ao Supremo que impeça a prisão do petista antes de ele ter seus recursos analisados em tribunais superiores, em Brasília.

Lula foi condenado em 2ª Instância pelo TRF-4 (Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região), em Porto Alegre, a 12 anos e 1 mês de prisão pelos crimes de corrupção e lavagem de dinheiro. Na 2ª feira (26.mar.2018), o TRF-4 conclui a análise de recursos apresentados pela defesa do petista. Depois, há 1 outro tipo de ação chamado “embargo dos embargos”, que pode protelar a conclusão do processo para o final de abril. Depois disso, viria a prisão.

Se o STF conceder o habeas corpus preventivo a Lula –o que parece ser o mais provável–, o ex-presidente ficará em liberdade até que o STJ (Superior Tribunal de Justiça) termine de analisar todos os seus recursos. Isso pode levar, pelo menos, 1 ano.

Os 6 votos que devem conceder o habeas corpus a Lula são destes ministros do STF: Celso de Mello, Dias Toffoli, Gilmar Mendes, Marco Aurélio Mello, Ricardo Lewandowski e Rosa Weber.

Quem vai rejeitar o habeas corpus: Alexandre de Moraes, Cármen Lúcia, Edson Fachin, Luiz Fux e Roberto Barroso.

A ministra que menos fala no STF é Rosa Weber. Ela foi voto vencido quando foi firmado o entendimento atual da Corte: condenados em 2ª Instância podem começar a cumpria a pena.

Por essa razão, a mídia recebeu uma enxurrada de interpretações sobre Rosa sempre ressalvar sua posição pessoal, mas votando conforme a jurisprudência geral. Ou seja, nesta 5ª feira, a ministra diria que tem posição a favor de conceder habeas corpus, mas que vota pela não concessão do benefício por respeitar a maioria da Corte.

Ocorre que essa interpretação sobre como Rosa Weber tem procedido está errada. É curioso que tenha frequentado a mídia sem contestação.

Rosa Weber votou recentemente para conceder 1 habeas corpus, como mostra a imagem abaixo. Foi uma decisão de fevereiro deste ano e tratava-se de 1 habeas corpus para réu condenado em 2ª Instância. A ministra foi voto vencido, mas manteve-se firme em sua convicção.

É claro que Rosa Weber poderá, de ontem para hoje, ter mudado de opinião. Mas seria uma alteração abrupta de convicção, difícil de ser entendida por quem acompanha os votos da ministra.

O fato é que de ontem para hoje Brasília viveu 1 ambiente de pressão e contrapressão a favor ou contra conceder 1 habeas corpus para Lula. Até porque, uma vez que o plenário decidir, essa será a jurisprudência formada –valerá para todos os demais réus condenados em 2ª Instância.

Se der a lógica e os ministros se mantiverem fiéis a suas posições conhecidas, o julgamento do habeas corpus nesta 5ª feira é uma derrota para a presidente do STF. Ela deu inúmeras entrevistas se negando a pautar o assunto.

Ontem, 4ª feira (21.mar.2018), prestes a ser questionada e derrotada no plenário do STF, teve de recuar e pautar esse julgamento para hoje.

Há uma estratégia na decisão de Cármen Lúcia. Já que seria derrotada pelo plenário, resolveu personalizar ao máximo a tomada de decisão da Corte. Hoje, o Supremo vai votar “a favor de Lula” ou “contra Lula”. Por mais que os ministros digam que examinam o tema “em tese”, a personificação do acusado impede que a interpretação se relacione diretamente ao líder petista.

Uma forma de deixar o STF em posição mais neutra teria sido pautar para o plenário a votação das ADCs 43 e 44 (Ações Declaratórias de Constitucionalidade) que questionam a possibilidade de condenados em 2ª Instância cumprirem a pena imediatamente. Mas Cármen Lúcia afirmou em 29 de janeiro de 2018 que incluir esse julgamento na pauta da Corte seria “apequenar” o Supremo. Repetiu isso de outra forma inúmeras vezes nas últimas semanas. Ficou aprisionada a essa afirmação.

Para não parecer 1 recuo completo —o que de fato foi—, Cármen Lúcia manteve sua palavra e não pautou as ADCs sobre prisão após 2ª Instância. Preferiu jogar para o plenário a decisão a respeito de conceder 1 habeas corpus preventivo para Lula.

Antes de iniciar a sessão do STF da 4ª feira, Cármen Lúcia comunicou a todos os colegas que estava cedendo e colocando o HC do petista para ser votado. Chegou a fazer uma proposta curiosa, prontamente rechaçada por todos os presentes: marcar o julgamento em uma sessão na 2ª feira (26.mar.2018).

Todos recusaram essa hipótese porque seria uma armadilha política. É nessa data, 2ª feira, que o TRF-4 vai analisar recursos de Lula. O Brasil nesse caso ficaria entre 2 julgamentos na mesma data: o TRF-4 votando para que o petista fosse preso ao mesmo tempo que o STF, em Brasília, estaria decidindo que o petista teria de ficar em liberdade. O grau de esquizofrenia do Poder Judiciário poderia chegar ao paroxismo, com consequências imprevisíveis.

O cenário deve ficar 1 pouco mais claro a partir da decisão de hoje, quando o STF possivelmente concederá 1 habeas corpus preventivo para Lula. Antes havia dúvida se o petista seria preso, se seria solto depois de 1 período na cadeia e quando tudo isso poderia acontecer. Agora, a realidade estará posta.

A partir desse novo cenário, o petista ficará possivelmente livre por pelo menos mais 1 ano com recursos em tramitação no STJ. Não poderá ser candidato a presidente, pois a Lei da Ficha Limpa é incontornável. Mas ficará à vontade para percorrer o país, dar entrevistas e fazer discursos de apoio a quem vier a apoiar em eleições locais e na disputa presidencial.

Livre, apesar de condenado em 2ª Instância, Lula deve ser confirmado como candidato a presidente pelo PT na data-limite para registro no TSE, em 15 de agosto. A partir daí sua candidatura será impugnada e posteriormente cassada pela Lei da Ficha Limpa. Só que ele poderá fazer muita campanha até meados de setembro, adotar o discurso da vitimação e apresentar 1 substituto na última hora.

É claro que a definição sobre prisão ou não de Lula ajuda a tornar o cenário mais claro. Mas esta é uma das corridas presidenciais mais imprevisíveis de anos recentes.

Lula vai transferir quantos votos para o candidato de verdade do PT ao Planalto? Difícil saber. A lógica manda acreditar que o petista presidenciável, seja quem for, dificilmente terá menos de 10% ou 15% dos votos –podendo, bem trabalhado, bater em 20% e ir para o 2º turno.

Ao mesmo tempo, as forças do “centro liberal” continuam a desconfiar do tucano Geraldo Alckmin. O Poder360 ouve coisas impublicáveis de líderes do DEM, partido que tradicionalmente fica com o PSDB.

Tudo considerado, com a decisão desta 5ª feira no STF, a disputa presidencial terá 1 elemento a mais conhecido (a possível presença de Lula, livre, percorrendo o país). Só que ainda seria arriscadíssimo vaticinar o desfecho.

368,4,,"Te odio y te aborrezco.

Eres peor que la mugre.

Además de ser una de las escenas más divertidas de The Little Rascals, esta pequeña carta encierra una enorme verdad: a veces, las mujeres odian a los hombres. Es cierto que esta aversión se manifiesta más durante la infancia, cuando los niños parecen venir de un planeta distinto al de las niñas.

Sin embargo, con el paso de los años hay ciertas cualidades que permanecen en los hombres y nos hacen detestarlos un poco. Algunos son aspectos que pasan desapercibidos, otros son actitudes muy evidentes que a las mujeres les resultan desagradables. Quizá jamás te lo han dicho, pero éstas son algunas cosas que las mujeres podrían odiar de ti:

Raspa las piernas y no es nada sexy.

Que te diga “así” o ""aquí"" y que tú hagas caso omiso.

No importa si ya está desnuda en tu cama. No es no.

Generalmente, quienes más se jactan son los que menos tienen por qué.

Y no esperar a que ella llegue también.

Y estés en tu zona de confort.

Habrá un momento en que no sea raro para ambos, pero eso lleva un proceso.

Si vas a decir que estuviste en casa de tu abuela, por lo menos pide a tus amigos que no te etiqueten en la foto de la fiesta.

Y llegar tarde a todos lados.

Y te dé pena decirle lo que de verdad sientes.

Cuando ella sabe que por dentro sólo tienes miedo de verte vulnerable.

¿De verdad es algo que ella deba escuchar?

No es su obligación estar con alguien que no le gusta.

Un ""hola"" no es igual a un ""me gustas"".

Y cuando estás sobrio, ni le escribes.

Y cuando ella lo requiere, desapareces.

No la impactarás con eso, al contrario, es demasiado molesto, ¿sabes a cuántos más ha escuchado decir lo mismo?

¿De verdad aún no te queda claro lo absurdo de ese término?

O sea, ¿tú le vas a explicar lo que ella quiere decir?

No lo están. Deja de seguir alimentando estereotipos.

Como podrás percibirlo, las cosas que odian las mujeres de los hombres no son tan ""secretas"" ni difíciles de adivinar. Se trata de actitudes fuera de lugar que, en la mayoría de los casos, buscan subestimar la inteligencia y valía del género femenino. Por supuesto, es importante recordar que existen un sinnúmero de cualidades que son atractivas en los varones. Pero, sin duda, el respeto mutuo es la mayor de todas y una condición necesaria para que la convivencia entre ambos sexos pueda darse sin mayor problema.

Dezenas de mulheres enviaram mensagens à redação do 247, depois que Kim Kataguiri, do MBL, que apoiou um golpe misógino contra a presidente Dilma Rousseff, fez protestos contra direitos das trabalhadoras da empresa, espalhou notícias falsas contra Marielle Franco e continua disseminando mensagens de ódio e obscurantismo pelo País, anunciou que Flávio Rocha terá o apoio do movimento em sua candidatura presidencial; ou seja: Rocha não ganha votos e perde consumidores; leia todas as mensagens e confira o que eles pensam sobre a rede varejista

247 – O boicote de consumidoras contra a Riachuelo, que se uniu ao MBL, grupo de natureza fascista, ganha corpo. Dezenas de mulheres enviaram mensagens à redação do 247, depois que Kim Kataguiri, do MBL, que apoiou um golpe misógino contra a presidente Dilma Rousseff, fez protestos contra direitos das trabalhadoras da empresa, espalhou notícias falsas contra Marielle Franco e continua disseminando mensagens de ódio e obscurantismo pelo País, anunciou que Flávio Rocha terá o apoio do movimento em sua candidatura presidencial. Isso significa que Rocha não ganha votos e perde consumidores.

Leia as mensagens e confira o que as consumidoras pensam sobre a rede varejista:

Angela Mamede – Eu gostava da Riachuelo. Gostava de pinçar peças de roupa baratas e bonitas. Mas desde que seu dono começou a demonstrar seu fascismo apoiando o Golpe contra a democracia brasileira e apoiando as reformas trabalhista e da previdência, prejudicando justamente as suas próprias clientes, que são mulheres de classe média e média baixa, tomei um nojo imenso da Riachuelo. Cortei totalmente essa loja da minha vida. Não piso mais lá de jeito nenhum. Também não compro mais nas Lojas Marisa desde que ela atacou o Lula e a Dona Marisa em uma peça publicitária em 2016, após a morte da Dona Marisa que dizia ""A culpa não é da Marisa"" e foi usada como comercial do Dia das Mães. Na época da postagem, notícias falsas de que o ex-presidente Lula teria culpado sua esposa falecida de envolvimento em irregularidades. Da mesma forma, não ligo a Globo de jeito nenhum nem nenhum canal de TV aberta que é golpista nem compro nenhum jornal de grande circulação pois a mídia brasileira de uma canalhice imensa e manipula todas as informações em favor dos ricos e contra os pobres. Atualmente, só acompanho blogues de esquerda, por meio do Facebook e do Youtube para me informar sobre política.

Juliana Mello – Depois de saber do conluio dessa empresa Riachuelo com o golpe e com o discurso mais fascista que existe no cenário atual (MBL), não ponho mais meus pés nesta loja. Em NENHUMA HIPÓTESE!

Luciana Escobar – Desde o golpe contra a Dilma e por convicções anti-escravocratas, não compro NADA na Riachuelo. Na minha cidade não tem essa loja, mas É próxima do RJ e lá tem. Sou voz contra eles desde o golpe.

Leila Sousa de Jesus – Confesso que já comprei na Riachuelo poucas vezes. Desde a primeira declaração do Presidente da Riachuelo apoiando o GOLPE, fiz a promessa de ""RIACHUELO NUNCA MAIS"" e ""DE MULHER PRA MULHER: LOJAS MARISA NUNCA MAIS"".

Sivialine Santiago – Resolvi nunca mais colocar os meus pés na Riachuelo desde junho de 2016! Eis o meu relato: Em meados de junho, caminhava pelo calçadão de lojas da Rua XV de Novembro em Curitiba. No dia estava a fazer compras, tinha algumas sacolas nas mãos, passei em frente a Riachuelo e resolvi entrar. Ao adentrar o estabelecimento o segurança olhou-me dos pés a cabeça e falou algo no rádio, até aí tudo bem, subi pela escada rolante ao segundo piso. Chegando ao andar superior uma funcionária estava a minha espera, perguntou se eu precisava de alguma coisa e seguiu-me pela loja toda, até o momento que deixei a instalação. Logicamente que esse tipo de ""coisa"", deve ocorrer em diversos lugares e estabelecimentos com pessoas negras e pardas como eu, comentei ""o acontecimento"" com alguns amigos e familiares que disseram-me que isso era vitimismo, impressão errada que eu tive (diga-se de passagem que a grande maioria de amigos e familiares são brancos e apoiadores de Moro e Bolsonaro). Enfim não compro nunca mais na Riachuelo racista e elitista.

Stella Petrasi – Nunca comprei e jamais comprarei nada desta loja. Além de ser golpista, se utiliza de trabalho escravo.

Tati Rivoire – Nunca mais entrarei nas lojas Riachuelo. Infelizmente, os funcionários que sofrerão com um possível grande boicote.

Rosa Soares – Riachuelo fora da minha vida. Nem entro nas lojas e nem entrarei.

Fernanda Scherer – Boicoto todas as marcas golpistas, inclusive, esta loja. O dono da Riachuelo, além de golpista, é escravagista. E, unindo-se ao MBL, escancara o que sempre foi. Um grande fascista!

Marisa Peixoto – Há anos não compro na Riachuelo. E por vários motivos. O principal deles é porque Flávio Rocha é fascista, escravocrata e preconceituoso. Um mau exemplo de brasileiro.

Jaqueline de Camargo – Eu e minha filha costumávamos comprar na Riachuelo, ela mais jovem gastava bastante lá. Desde as notícias de trabalho escravo passamos a ter muita má vontade com a Loja. A partir do apoio ao golpe simplesmente paramos de comprar (também nas lojas Marisa, outra sem caráter). A partir de hoje, sabendo da propaganda do MBL a gente já começou a divulgar nas conversas de whatsapp, incrível ver a concordância: RIACHUELO ESTÁ LIGADA AO MBL, NEM PENSAR EM COMPRAR NADA LÁ! Quem apela para MBL é porque trabalha contra a democracia no Brasil.

Suzy Fecher – Não compro, cancelo todos os envios de e-mail. A última vez que estive nesta loja foi em 2013. Estou fora.

Miriam Goldfeder – Nunca comprei ou entrei em qualquer destas lojas exploradoras do trabalho humano e abertamente fascistas! Espero que as mulheres (e homens) de bem colaborem para tornar esta empresa inviável! E este homem inelegível!

Mônica Duque – Nunca comprei na Riachuelo. Agora, se passar na frente de uma loja, troco de calçada!

Sandra Suassuna – Flávio Rocha dono das lojas Riachuello, infelizmente nasceu no meu estado (RN). Esse canalha foi condenado pela justiça trabalhista por pratica escravagista em sua lojas e fabricas. Parei de comprar nas RIACHUELO EM PROTESTO CONTRA O GOLPE QUE O CANALHA FLÁVIO ROCHA APOIOU. #RIACHUELLONAOCOMPRO.

Maria Alice Braga – Já não comprava nessa loja, agora então é que nunca porei meus pés lá!

Almeri Souza – Sou de Porto Alegre, tenho 68 anos. Nunca mais comprei num comprarei nas Lojas Riachuelo depois que fiquei sabendo a quem eles servem. Na minha casa ninguém compra desta gente, nem minha filha nem seu marido nem meu filho.

Dafne Ashton – Não compro na Riachuelo pq acredito que uma empresa que apoia um golpe de estado em uma democracia e que continua praticando atos contra a soberania do país, e encorajando medidas contra a população mais pobre, não merece o dinheiro do trabalhador brasileiro, dinheiro conseguido com tanto suor.

Ivani Rosa – Já comprei, hoje não compro mais dessa empresa, Riachuelo. Aliás, não assisto mais TV aberta e não compro cerveja falsificada golpista.

Aurea Carvalho – Graças ao histórico do dono, é de bom tom, não comprar na Riachuelo e por tanto, já comprei, mas não comprarei mais nesta loja.

Porcina Frota – Desde que tomei que soube do apoio da Riachuelo ao golpe contra a presidenta Dilma que não compro nada e nem entro mais em nenhuma de suas lojas.

Maria Marlene Daniel – Não compro na Riachuelo por vários motivos. As roupas de qualidade inferior, caras e mais importante: não gosto da forma que suas funcionárias são tratadas, nem sequer tem o direito de reinvindicar direitos. Uma empresa que não respeita direitos, funcionários, gestores arrogantes, a Riachuelo não tem nada de bom para me oferecer.

Rosali Cantlin - Eu era cliente da Riachuelo, até apoiarem o golpe. Nunca mais comprei e faço campanha contra, esclarecendo amigos e família. Riachuel golpista, nunca mais!

Antônio Claret dos Santos - Vocês pediram a opinião de mulheres, mas vou dar a minha. Se minha esposa chegar em casa com roupa da Riachuelo, faço ela tirar na hora, toco fogo e mando ela devolver as cinzas na loja.

Maria Cristina Tavares - Acho que nunca comprei na Riachuelo, mas com certeza jamais comprarei.

Christianne Brilha Guia - Nunca foi tão importante como agora sabermos quem está por trás de tudo que consumimos no dia-a-dia. A energia da roupa que vestimos, a escolha do alimento que nos nutri, enfim, do que levamos para nossa casa. Oferecemos para família, para quem amamos e as pessoas em geral o que queremos para nós mesmos, aí a importância em procurar a origem dos fabricantes e seu papel no cenário político do país. Uma empresa preconceituosa como a Riachuelo não merece atenção de mulher nenhuma, de ninguém. Sabendo-se disso tudo e ainda continuarmos a comprar nessa loja, estamos ajudando indiretamente o preconceito, a desigualdade, a prepotência e continuação da decadência atual.

Cláudia Freire - Eu me tornei compradora da Riachuelo há mais de 30 anos quando engravidei do meu primeiro filho. Era um bom lugar para artigos de casa. Minha mãe era cliente assídua também. Permaneci cliente da Riachuelo durante esse tempo todo até deixar de comprar lá por conta do golpe. Não tenho mais cartão e nem compro absolutamente nada lá. E falo sempre para os meus filhos não comprarem nada de lá. Não só na Riachuelo, como também na Marisa. Também não compro no Habib's e outros locais claramente golpistas ou que fico sabendo que possuem trabalho escravo. É o mínimo que podemos fazer.

Daniela Fragoso - Sou arquiteta e radialista e moro em São Paulo. Vi o programa hoje de manhã e aqui vai meu depoimento sobre as lojas Riachuelo. O dono fascista da Riachuelo deveria ajoelhar aos pés de Lula em agradecimento , pois durante os governos petistas a marca até melhorou( pois era chinfrim), nos governos petistas, o povo tinha poder de compra. Nunca fui frequentadora dessa loja golpista cafona , mas podem ter certeza que depois das declarações fascistas e do apoio do MBL, JAMAIS colocarei meus pés nessa loja.

Mônica Costa - Eu deixei de entrar em qualquer loja Riachuelo, desde o lamentável episódio do assédio moral do dono daquela empresa à Promotoria Pública do Trabalho no Rio Grande do Norte (onde vivo), que acusava a empresa de estimular o trabalho em condições análogas à escravidão nas pequenas fábricas, também conhecidas como facções, localizadas na cidade de Caicó, no interior do estado. A Riachuelo compra a peça pronta dessas fabriquetas sem nenhum custo trabalhista e a preços baixíssimos.

O Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª região (TRF4), sediado em Porto Alegre, marcou para segunda-feira (26) o julgamento do recurso do ex-presidente Lula no processo envolvendo o triplex no Guarujá (SP), em que o petista foi condenado sem provas, com uma tese questionada por vários juristas; quem marcou a data foi o desembargador João Pedro Gebran Neto, relator da ação da Operação Lava Jato na segunda instância; o TRF-4 informou que não haverá transmissão ao vivo, como ocorreu no dia 24 de janeiro, quando o órgão condenou Lula a 12 anos e a 1 mês de prisão, dando continuidade à caçada judicial contra o petista

Rio Grande do Sul 247 - O Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª região (TRF4), sediado em Porto Alegre, marcou para segunda-feira (26) o julgamento do recurso do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva no processo envolvendo o triplex no Guarujá (SP), em que o petista foi condenado sem provas, com uma tese questionada por vários juristas. Quem marcou a data foi o desembargador João Pedro Gebran Neto, relator da ação da Operação Lava Jato na segunda instância. O TRF-4 informou que não haverá transmissão ao vivo, como ocorreu no dia 24 de janeiro, quando o órgão condenou Lula a 12 anos e a 1 mês de prisão.

De acordo com o tribunal, Lula deve começar a cumprir uma pena após o julgamento de ""recursos dotados de efeito suspensivo"", que impedem a execução da decisão judicial. É o caso dos embargos de declaração, o único recurso com esta característica à disposição da defesa de Lula neste tribunal.

A defesa do ex-presidente pode tentar evitar a prisão do petista ao apresentar mais um recurso à 8ª Turma após o julgamento dos embargos, um novo recurso que teria de ser apresentado imediatamente após a primeira negativa. Neste caso, a ideia seria o colegiado analisar antes que haja uma ordem para que a pena seja executada.

A condenação do ex-presidente foi contestada por vários juristas. Lula recebeu apoio até no exterior. Em janeiro, 600 juristas divulgaram uma carta em cinco idiomas para o mundo, denunciado o estado de exceção judicial no Brasil, que tem dentre os alvos o ex-presidente (leia aqui).

O Ministério Público Federal denunciou Lula, em setembro de 2016, alegando que o petista recebeu R$ 3,7 milhões em benefício próprio da empreiteira OAS, entre 2006 e 2012, através de um triplex no Guarujá (SP). Na apresentação da denúncia, o procurador Henrique Pozzobon admitiu não existir ""prova cabal"" de que o petista é ""proprietário no papel"" do tripléx.

Em janeiro de 2018, a juíza Luciana Correa Torres de Oliveira, da 2ª Vara de Execução e Títulos no Distrito Federal, determinou a penhora dos bens da OAS, numa ação movida por credores. E o curioso é que um dos ativos penhorados é justamente o triplex que a Lava Jato atribuiu ao ex-presidente Lula (veja aqui).

386,4,,"Noam Chomsky (Filadélfia, 1928) superou faz tempo as barreiras da vaidade. Não fala de sua vida privada, não usa celular e em um tempo onde abunda o líquido e até o gasoso, ele representa o sólido. Foi detido por opor-se à Guerra do Vietnã, figurou na lista negra de Richard Nixon, apoiou a publicação dos Papéis do Pentágono e denunciou a guerra suja de Ronald Reagan. Ao longo de 60 anos, não há luta que ele não tenha travado. Defende tanto a causa curda como o combate à mudança climática. Tanto aparece em uma manifestação do Occupy Movement como apoia os imigrantes sem documentos.

Mergulhado na agitação permanente, o jovem que nos anos cinquenta deslumbrou o mundo com a gramática gerativa e seus universais, longe de descansar sobre as glórias do filósofo, optou pelo movimento contínuo. Não se importou com que o acusassem de antiamericano ou extremista. Sempre seguiu em frente com valentia, enfrentando os demônios do capitalismo − sejam os grandes bancos, os conglomerados militares ou Donald Trump. À prova de fogo, sua última obra volta a confirmar sua tenacidade. Em Réquiem para o sonho americano (editora Bertrand Brasil), ele põe no papel as teses expostas no documentário homônimo e denuncia a obscena concentração de riqueza e poder que exibem as democracias ocidentais. O resultado são 192 páginas de Chomsky em estado puro. Vibrante e claro.

— O senhor se considera um radical?

— Todos consideramos a nós mesmos moderados e razoáveis.

— Acredito que toda autoridade tem de se justificar. Que toda hierarquia é ilegítima enquanto não demonstrar o contrário. Às vezes pode se justificar, mas na maioria das vezes, não. E isso... isso é anarquismo.

Uma luz seca envolve Chomsky. Depois de 60 anos dando aulas no Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts (MIT, na sigla em inglês), o professor veio viver nos confins do deserto de Sonora, no Arizona. Em Tucson, a mais de 4.200 quilômetros de Boston, ele se instalou e estreou um escritório no Departamento de Linguística da Universidade do Arizona. O centro é um dos poucos pontos verdes dessa cidade abrasadora. Freixos, salgueiros, palmeiras e nogueiras crescem em torno de um edifício de tijolos vermelhos de 1904 onde tudo fica pequeno, mas tudo é acolhedor. Pelas paredes há fotos de alunos sorridentes, mapas das populações indígenas, estudos de fonética, cartazes de atos culturais e, no fundo do corredor, à direita, o escritório do maior linguista vivo.

O lugar não tem nada a ver com o espaço inovador do Frank Gehry que o abrigava em Boston. Aqui, mal cabe uma mesa de trabalho e outra para sentar-se com dois ou três alunos. Recém-estreado, o escritório de um dos acadêmicos mais citados do século XX ainda não tem livros próprios, e seu principal ponto de atenção recai em duas janelas que inundam a sala de âmbar. Chomsky, de calças jeans e longos cabelos brancos, gosta dessa atmosfera calorosa. A luz do deserto foi um dos motivos que o levaram a se mudar para Tucson. “É seca e clara”, comenta. Sua voz é grave e ele deixa que se perca nos meandros de cada resposta. Gosta de falar longamente. Pressa não é com ele.

Resposta. Já faz 40 anos que o neoliberalismo, liderado por Ronald Reagan e Margaret Thatcher, assaltou o mundo. E isso teve um efeito. A concentração aguda de riqueza em mãos privadas veio acompanhada de uma perda do poder da população geral. As pessoas se sentem menos representadas e levam uma vida precária, com trabalhos cada vez piores. O resultado é uma mistura de aborrecimento, medo e escapismo. Já não se confia nem nos próprios fatos. Há quem chama isso de populismo, mas na verdade é descrédito das instituições.

P. E assim surgem as fake news (os boatos)?

R. A desilusão com as estruturas institucionais levou a um ponto em que as pessoas já não acreditam nos fatos. Se você não confia em ninguém, por que tem de confiar nos fatos? Se ninguém faz nada por mim, por que tenho de acreditar em alguém?

P. Nem mesmo nos veículos de comunicação?

R. A maioria está servindo aos interesses de Trump.

P. Mas há alguns muito críticos, como The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN…

R. Olhe a televisão e as primeiras páginas dos jornais. Não há nada mais que Trump, Trump, Trump. A mídia caiu na estratégia traçada por Trump. Todo dia ele lhes dá um estímulo ou uma mentira para se manter sob os holofotes e ser o centro da atenção. Enquanto isso, o flanco selvagem dos republicanos vai desenvolvendo sua política de extrema direita, cortando direitos dos trabalhadores e abandonando a luta contra a mudança climática, que é precisamente aquilo que pode acabar com todos nós.

P. O senhor vê em Trump um risco para a democracia?

R. Representa um perigo grave. Liberou de forma consciente e deliberada ondas de racismo, xenofobia e sexismo que estavam latentes, mas que ninguém tinha legitimado.

R. É possível, se conseguir retardar o efeito letal de suas políticas. É um demagogo e showman consumado que sabe como manter ativa sua base de adoradores. Também joga a seu favor o fato de que os democratas estão mergulhados na confusão e podem não ser capazes de apresentar um programa convincente.

R. É um homem decente. Usa o termo socialista, mas nele significa mais um New Deal democrata. Suas propostas, de fato, não seriam estranhas a Eisenhower [presidente dos EUA pelo Partido Republicano de 1953 a 1961]. Seu sucesso, mais que o de Trump, foi a verdadeira surpresa das eleições de 2016. Pela primeira vez em um século houve alguém que esteve a ponto de ser candidato sem apoio das corporações nem dos veículos de comunicação, só com o apoio popular.

P. Houve um deslizamento para a direita do espectro político?

R. Na elite do espectro político sim, ocorreu esse deslizamento, mas não na população em geral. Desde os anos oitenta se vive uma ruptura entre o que as pessoas desejam e as políticas públicas. É fácil ver isso no caso dos impostos. As pesquisas mostram que a maioria quer impostos mais altos para os ricos. Mas isso nunca se leva a cabo. Frente a isso se promoveu a ideia de que reduzir impostos traz vantagens para todos e que o Estado é o inimigo. Mas quem se beneficia da reduzir [verbas para] estradas,hospitais, água limpa e ar respirável?

R. O neoliberalismo existe, mas só para os pobres. O mercado livre é para eles, não para nós. Essa é a história do capitalismo. As grandes corporações empreenderam a luta de classes, são autênticos marxistas, mas com os valores invertidos. Os princípios do livre mercado são ótimos para ser aplicados aos pobres, mas os muito ricos são protegidos. As grandes indústrias de energia recebem subvenções de centenas de milhões de dólares, a economia de alta tecnologia se beneficia das pesquisas públicas de décadas anteriores, as entidades financeiras obtêm ajuda maciça depois de afundar… Todas elas vivem com um seguro: são consideradas muito grandes para cair e são resgatadas se têm problemas. No fim das contas, os impostos servem para subvencionar essas entidades e com elas, os ricos e poderosos. Mas além disso se diz à população que o Estado é o problema e se reduz seu campo de ação. E o que ocorre? Seu espaço é ocupado pelo poder privado, e a tirania das grandes corporações fica cada vez maior.

P. O que o senhor descreve soa a George Orwell.

R. Até Orwell estaria assombrado. Vivemos a ficção de que o mercado é maravilhoso porque nos dizem que está composto por consumidores informados que adotam decisões racionais. Mas basta ligar a televisão e ver os anúncios: procuram informar o consumidor para que tome decisões racionais? Ou procuram enganar? Pensemos, por exemplo, nos anúncios de carros. Oferecem dados sobre suas características? Apresentam informes realizados por entidades independentes? Porque isso sim que geraria consumidores informados capazes de tomar decisões racionais. Em vez disso, o que vemos é um carro voando, pilotado por um ator famoso. Tentam prejudicar o mercado. As empresas não querem mercados livres, querem mercados cativos. De outra forma, colapsariam.

P. Diante dessa situação, não é muito fraca a contestação social?

R. Há muitos movimentos populares muito ativos, mas não se presta atenção neles porque as elites não querem que se aceite o fato de que a democracia pode funcionar. Isso é perigoso para elas. Pode ameaçar seu poder. O melhor é impor uma visão que diz a você que o Estado é seu inimigo e que você tem de fazer o que puder sozinho.

P. Trump usa frequentemente o termo antiamericano. Como o senhor entende esse termo?

R. Os Estados Unidos são o único país onde, por criticar o Governo, te chamam de antiamericano. E isso representa um controle ideológico, acendendo fogueiras patrióticas por toda parte.

P. Em alguns lugares da Europa também ocorre isso.

R. Mas nada comparável ao que ocorre aqui, não há outro país onde se vejam tantas bandeiras.

R. Depende. Se significa estar interessado em sua cultura local, é bom. Mas se for uma arma contra outros, sabemos aonde pode conduzir, já vimos e experimentamos isso.

P. Acha possível que se repita o que ocorreu nos anos trinta?

R. A situação se deteriorou. Depois da eleição de Barack Obama se desencadeou uma reação racista de enorme virulência, com campanhas que negavam sua cidadania e identificavam o presidente negro com o anticristo. Houve muitas manifestações de ódio. No entanto, os EUA não são a República de Weimar [democracia alemã anterior ao nazismo]. Precisamos estar preocupados, mas as probabilidades de que se repita algo assim não são altas.

P. Seu livro começa lembrando a Grande Depressão, uma época em que “tudo estava pior que agora, mas havia um sentimento de que tudo iria melhorar”.

R. Eu me lembro perfeitamente. Minha família era de classe trabalhadora, estava desempregada e não tinha educação. Objetivamente, era uma época muito pior que agora, mas havia um sentimento de que todos estávamos juntos naquilo. Havia um presidente compreensivo com o sofrimento, os sindicatos estavam organizados, havia movimentos populares… Tinha-se a ideia de que juntos podíamos vencer a crise. E isso se perdeu. Agora vivemos a sensação de que estamos sozinhos, de que não há nada a fazer, de que o Estado está contra nós…

R. Claro que há esperança. Ainda há movimentos populares, gente disposta a lutar… As oportunidades estão aí, a questão é se somos capazes de aproveitá-las.

Chomsky termina com um sorriso. Deixa vibrando no ar sua voz grave e se despede com extrema cortesia. Em seguida, sai do escritório e desce as escadas da faculdade. Fora, esperam-lhe Tucson e a luz seca do deserto de Sonora.

Ronaldo está na Austrália para promover exposição do Real Madrid na Oceania. O Fenômeno disse que a conquista da Copa do Mundo é algo sonhado pelo povo brasileiro e que qualquer outro resultado não será bem aceito no país.

Willian chega revelou que tem feito mudanças no seu dia a dia para chegar bem ao Mundial. Em entrevista nesta quarta-feira (21), o jogador do Chelsea disse que trocou até a alimentação e não quis fazer comparações com a preparação da equipe de agora com o time de 2014, para a Copa no Brasil.

Meio-campista brasileiro do Napoli, Jorginho atendeu à convocação da seleção italiana para jogo contra a Suécia, em repescagem que terminou com derrota da Azzurra. Apesar de não ter conseguido a classificação para a Copa do Mundo, o jogador diz que não se arrepende da sua decisão.

Astro do Bayern de Munique e da seleção alemã de futebol, o atacante Thomas Muller, autor do primeiro gol da histórica goleada por 7 a 1 sobre o Brasil, disse que as memórias do jogo da Copa de 2014 não entrarão em campo no amistoso desta terça-feira (27). Para ele, sua equipe estar ligada mesmo não se tratando de uma partida oficial.

Alvo do Barcelona para a próxima temporada, Antoine Griezmann declarou que prefere decidir seu futuro antes mesmo da Copa do Mundo, que será realizada no mês de junho. O jogador prefere ir para o Mundial já com a situação resolvida.

Desde a última Eurocopa, há dois anos, o futebol do Velho Continente experimenta uma tendência importante por parte das equipes mais cautelosas. Trata-se do uso de uma linha com cinco defensores, expediente que tem tirado o sono de Tite nos últimos tempos na caminhada ao Mundial da Rússia. Meses depois de ficar ""traumatizado"" com o sistema no amistoso contra a Inglaterra, o treinador fez a lição de casa e esperava testar suas alternativas contra a Rússia, nesta sexta, às 13h de Brasília.

A crise diplomática que se instalou entre Reino Unido e Rússia após o caso de envenenamento do ex-agente russo Sergei Skripal fez com que a tese de boicote à Copa do Mundo fosse levantada. Ministro de Relações Exteriores, Boris Johnson indicou a possibilidade, gerando reações de todos os envolvidos.

Mike Krzyzewski é um premiado treinador do basquete universitário americano e membro da seleção de seu país há décadas. Fez parte do título histórico dos Jogos de Barcelona com o Dream Team, em 1992, como membro da comissão técnica, e foi técnico principal da equipe nos três últimos ouros olímpicos. O livro do ""Coach K"", como ele é mais conhecido, foi a maneira encontrada por Tite para presentear e motivar jogadores da seleção brasileira em amistosos na Rússia. No jantar da última terça, o livro ""Liderar com o Coração"", que no Brasil é editado pela Sextante e tem prefácio de Bernardinho, foi distribuído aos atletas.

Antes de se apresentar à seleção brasileira no início dessa semana, em Moscou, Marquinhos recebeu a visita do fisioterapeuta Bruno Mazziotti. Membro da comissão técnica de Tite, ele foi a Paris para avaliar as condições do zagueiro do PSG. O zagueiro se recuperou recentemente de uma lesão muscular na coxa esquerda. Ele antecipou a volta aos gramados em uma semana para enfrentar recentemente o Real Madrid, mas foi poupado dos jogos seguintes para poder completar a recuperação e servir o Brasil.

Convocado de última hora nesta terça-feira (20) após a lesão de Alex Sandro, Ismaily desembarcou em Moscou no mesmo dia para atuar pela seleção brasileira nos amistosos contra Rússia e Alemanha. Após chegar ao hotel onde a delegação está hospedada, o lateral esquerdo do Shakhtar Donetsk mostrou muita alegria com o chamado de Tite.

Yaya Touré era para ser a grande novidade da seleção da Costa do Marfim nos amistosos dos dias 24 e 27 de março, contra Togo e Moldávia. Fora da Copa do Mundo, a equipe treinada por Kamara Ibrahim não tem notícias do paradeiro do jogador do Manchester City, que havia revogado sua aposentadoria da seleção no final de 2017 e foi chamado para os dois compromissos desta data Fifa.

“água é R$ 2, refrigerante é R$ 3”, avisa um vendedor em uma das principais ruas do centro do Rio de Janeiro.

Após o lançamento do álbum oficial do Mundial da Rússia, o mercado paralelo de figurinhas já funciona a todo vapor nos principais camelódromos da capital fluminense.

A Argentina se apresentou com novidade para a janela dos dois últimos amistosos antes da convocação final para a Copa do Mundo. Tratado como fenômeno no país sul-americano, o jovem Lauraro Martínez, do Racing, trabalhou nesta terça-feira em Manchester com os novos companheiros e relatou o primeiro encontro com o ídolo Lionel Messi, do Barcelona.

Contestados em clubes brasileiros, principalmente no São Paulo, Casemiro e Willian José tiveram a mesma porta de entrada na Europa e, após sucesso pela equipe B do Real Madrid, se estabeleceram no futebol espanhol. Em entrevista coletiva nesta terça-feira (20) em Moscou, o volante cumprimentou o atacante pela convocação e defendeu sua presença no grupo de Tite.

A seleção brasileira tinha tudo para fazer seu primeiro treino com o time completo na manhã desta terça-feira (20) em Moscou, na Rússia. Com as chegadas de Fagner e Pedro Geromel, Tite teria os 25 atletas à disposição para ensaiar a equipe que enfrenta os donos da casa às 19h (de Brasília) da próxima sexta-feira (23), no Estádio Lujniki. Um desconforto muscular na coxa direita, no entanto, tirou Alex Sandro das atividades em cima da hora.

Ao menos por enquanto, Rogério Caboclo ainda não é presidente da CBF (Confederação Brasileira de Futebol). A nomenclatura, no entanto, é apenas questão de tempo. Ele irá para a Europa para acompanhar os amistosos da seleção contra a Rússia e Alemanha e, com isso, inaugura uma nova era na confederação. é a primeira vez desde 2015 que o nome mais forte da entidade pode viajar para o exterior com a delegação. A última vez que isso aconteceu foi em 2015, quando Marco Polo Del Nero e José Maria Marin foram em reunião da Fifa, representando a CBF, em Zurique. Na ocasião, o FBI deflagrou a operação que acabaria por derrubar cartola por todo o mundo e Marin foi um dos presos.

A seleção brasileira reservou 50 quartos para os familiares dos atletas ficarem em Sochi, cidade da concentração da delegação durante a Copa do Mundo. Esse foi o máximo que o coordenador de seleções, Edu Gaspar, conseguiu disponibilizar para os 23 que estarão convocados. Cada atleta poderá avisar quantos quartos tem a intenção de reservar e precisará arcar com os custos. A CBF apenas facilitará o processo. As reservas começarão a ser feitas assim que a lista de convocados for divulgada. Como a lista do Mundial ainda não foi feita de forma oficial, nenhum atleta ainda abriu conversas para a reserva.

Tite esperava, neste mês de março na Rússia, um amistoso que colocasse o Brasil próximo das condições que irá encontrar na Copa do Mundo em junho. No que diz respeito aos aspectos climáticos, a previsão do tempo e uma partida disputada pela seleção em Moscou, há 12 anos, mostram que o panorama é bem diferente. E pode influenciar nas quatro linhas.

O lançamento de uma campanha publicitária do Banco Itaú na última segunda-feira (19), em rede nacional, traz Tite como estrela e seu inflamado discurso para os brasileiros como principal ingrediente em peça gravada nos vestiários do Maracanã. O treinador acompanha a seleção em Moscou para amistoso contra a Rússia na próxima sexta (23) às 13h (de Brasília). Já no dia 28, visita a Alemanha em Berlim.

Não é qualquer pessoa que tem a oportunidade de ir a um jogo de Copa do Mundo, muito menos a vários durante toda a vida.

Mas na prática não foi isso que aconteceu.

Em entrevista coletiva em Moscou, ele oficializou a realização de amistosos diante da Croácia, no dia 3 de junho, em cidade a ser definida na Inglaterra, e da áustria, no dia 10 do mesmo mês, em Viena.

Ao chegar no hotel da seleção brasileira em Moscou, Alisson diz já ter sentido o clima da Copa do Mundo. Um dos últimos a se apresentar no primeiro dia do time no país do Mundial, o goleiro repetiu o discurso de Tite para destacar a importância do jogo de sexta-feira (23) contra a Rússia, às 13h (de Brasília). O Brasil ainda enfrenta a Alemanha no dia 27, às 15h45.

16 gols em 38 jogos na atual temporada com o Besiktas fazem Tite esperar por Anderson Talisca, de braços abertos, nesta segunda-feira (19) em Moscou. Uma das novas apostas do treinador para a seleção que enfrenta Rússia e Alemanha nos próximos dias 23 e 27, às 13h e 15h45 (de Brasília), respectivamente, o baiano de 24 anos já acumulou suficientes atritos no futebol para ser chamado de ""indomável"", apesar da idade relativamente baixa.

A entrevista de Lionel Messi ao canal de televisão América TV, da Argentina, foi ao ar hoje (18). Nela, o atacante do Barcelona sobre as expectativas para a Copa da Rússia e relembrou as seguidas quedas em finais de sua seleção, principalmente a derrota para a Alemanha no Mundial de 2014.

Com amistoso marcado contra a anfitriã Rússia para a próxima sexta-feira (23), às 13h (de Brasília), a primeira parte da delegação da seleção brasileira chegou à capital Moscou neste domingo (18).

395,4,,"''Esse debate que agora está sendo equivocadamente vinculado de maneira exclusiva ao ex-presidente Lula, no fundo, é sobre qual o limite do poder do Estado brasileiro para começar a punir uma pessoa.''

A análise é de Alamiro Velludo Salvador Netto, professor titular do Departamento de Direito Penal, Medicina Forense e Criminologia da Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo. Advogado criminalista, também é pesquisador visitante na Universidade de Salamanca (Espanha), na Universidade de Bolonha (Itália) e na Universidade Pompeu Fabra (Espanha).

Ele, que é contra a execução provisória de pena após sentença em segunda instância, falou ao blog sobre a possibilidade do STF de alterar essa interpretação – o que poderia garantir que o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fique em liberdade até o fim dos recursos à condenação pelo juiz federal Sérgio Moro por conta do caso do triplex do Guarujá.

Alamiro foi citado pelo desembargador João Pedro Gebran Neto em seu voto que condenou Lula no Tribunal Regional Federal da 4a Região. Contudo, como reclamou em uma rede social na época, a citação de um texto seu foi feita de forma descontextualizada. Ele defende a necessidade de que seja apontado o vínculo entre o ato de ofício, neste caso, qual ação objetiva de corrupção foi realizada para que uma vantagem (o triplex) fosse recebida. Ou seja, o contrário do que foi defendido pelo juiz Moro e os desembargadores.

Para ele, Lula é mais um interessado, mas não o único, umas vez que a decisão afeta muitos brasileiros. ''Existe uma série de pessoas no Brasil que estão cumprindo penas antecipadas, ao meu ver, de forma contrária à Constituição.''

Para o professor, o Supremo acabou por legislar, ocupando funções do Congresso Nacional, ao permitir a prisão após segunda instância em 2016. Em sua análise, o conceito constitucional de ''trânsito em julgado'' significa apenas e somente apenas ''a partir do momento em que sobre uma decisão não recai mais nenhuma possibilidade de recurso''. Ou seja, o STF não poderia ter definido a segunda instância como momento em que se inicia a punição.

''O grande problema é quando o Judiciário, talvez atendendo ao clamor social, resolve passar por cima do texto legislativo e – mais do que isso – do texto da Constituição.''

Você concorda com a interpretação do Supremo Tribunal Federal, que permitiu a execução provisória da pena após condenação em segunda instância, mesmo com a defesa recorrendo a uma corte superior?

A decisão do Supremo Tribunal Federal foi muito questionada à época [fevereiro de 2016] não só pelos criminalistas, mas também pelo próprio ambiente acadêmico, pelos penalistas, processualistas, constitucionalistas. Porque a decisão que entende ser possível iniciar a execução provisória da pena a partir do encerramento da jurisdição dos tribunais em segunda instância, ou seja, os Tribunais de Justiça e os Tribunais Regionais Federais, viola o texto da própria Constituição Federal e o texto do Código de Processo Penal.

Porque, ao contrário de outros países, a exemplo da Espanha e da Itália, que falam simplesmente em garantir a presunção de inocência, no Brasil, a literalidade constitucional fala de trânsito em julgado. Trânsito em julgado é um conceito processual muito específico que significa ''a partir do momento em que sobre uma decisão não recai mais nenhuma possibilidade de recurso''.

Quando o Supremo Tribunal Federal, por 6 a 5, permitiu que as pessoas iniciassem a execução provisória após segunda instância, ali houve um movimento claramente contrário ao texto legal. Isso não significa que essa decisão seja boa ou ruim, mas que compete ao Parlamento, e exclusivamente ao Parlamento, na condição de poder constituinte, rever o posicionamento da opção legislativa brasileira. Mas não o Supremo.

Ao definir isso, o Supremo assumiu função do Congresso Nacional e legislou?

Parece-me que sim. Porque o conceito constitucional de trânsito em julgado, em que pese as interpretações que possam eventualmente ser dadas a ele, não significa ''antecipar execução de pena''. Pode ter sido uma opção ruim do constituinte brasileiro em 1988. Mas se era uma opção ruim, que fosse refeita ou rediscutida no âmbito parlamentar e não no âmbito do Supremo Tribunal Federal.

Agora, o Supremo pode rediscutir essa decisão por conta do ex-presidente Lula. Ela beneficiaria apenas políticos e empresários?

Quando o novo debate do Supremo Tribunal Federal ocorre em cima da discussão sobre o ex-presidente Lula dá a impressão que tudo se volta à questão de sua condenação. Mas existe uma série de pessoas no Brasil que estão nessas condições, que estão cumprindo penas antecipadas, pelo menos, ao meu ver, de forma contrária à Constituição.

É importante destacar que a decisão originária do Supremo Tribunal Federal sobre a prisão em segunda instância, em 2016, se deu no debate de um habeas corpus que julgava um roubo em Itapecerica da Serra. Portanto, não tinha nada haver com corrupção ou crime do colarinho branco [Um homem, filho de uma trabalhadora empregada doméstica e que trabalhava como assistente de garçom, foi acusado de roubar R$ 2600,00 de outra pessoa na rua e jurava inocência nesse município da Grande São Paulo].

O problema é se, de fato, a sociedade brasileira está disposta a romper com a dimensão de presunção da inocência. De romper com aquele pacto constitucional de 1988.

Antes do caso do ex-presidente Lula, os ministros Celso de Mello, Marco Aurélio Mello, Ricardo Lewandowski, José Dias Toffoli e Gilmar Mendes já concederam habeas corpus para condenados em segunda instância aguardarem em liberdade o final do processo. A impressão é que, com isso, querem debater a questão.

Exatamente. O grande desafio da sociedade brasileira neste momento é compreender que esse debate sobre a execução antecipada da pena não se refere especificamente a uma pessoa, mas a um pacto federativo. O processo penal, acima de tudo, é um exercício civilizatório – de saber o dado momento em que tenho uma formação de culpa suficiente para que uma pessoa começar a execução de sua pena.

Posso, enquanto sociedade, chegar à conclusão que basta a segunda instância. Tudo bem, eu pessoalmente não acho a melhor solução, mas é possível desde que o Parlamento assim faça. O grande problema é quando o Judiciário, talvez atendendo ao clamor social, resolve passar por cima do texto legislativo e – mais do que isso – do texto da Constituição. Trânsito em julgado é sinônimo de decisão sobre qual não cabe qualquer recurso possível.

O Supremo disse o seguinte: posso iniciar o cumprimento da pena esgotada a segunda instância que confirma a condenação da primeira. Então, nós começamos a criar, no Brasil, uma certa celeuma. Por exemplo, o sujeito foi condenado à pena de multa na primeira instância e novamente na segunda. Ele paga desde logo? A jurisprudência diz que não. Ele foi condenado à pena restritiva de direitos na primeira instância e a decisão foi reafirmada na segunda. Ele já inicia, desde logo, a restrição de direitos? A jurisprudência diz que não. Então, virou uma espécie de atalho exclusivamente para uma antecipação de pena privativa de liberdade. Isso criou uma casuística. Imagino que isso cria um sentimento de insegurança jurídica.

Parece que é uma interpretação que leva muito em consideração um sentimento de impunidade da comunidade e muito pouco a própria harmonia do sistema jurídico. Até porque a harmonia do sistema jurídico só faria sentido se nós tivéssemos uma alteração legislativa do órgão competente, o Congresso Nacional.

Mas dado os altos índices de criminalidade, uma parte considerável da população apoia a medida sob a justificativa de garantir a punição.

Esse debate que agora está sendo equivocadamente vinculado de maneira exclusiva ao ex-presidente Lula, no fundo, é sobre qual o limite do poder do Estado brasileiro para começar a punir uma pessoa. Do ponto de vista social, é óbvio que a sociedade pode ter um sentimento de que é preciso cumprir a pena antes. É um sentimento até aceitável em razão da criminalidade brasileira. Mas esse tipo de sentimento tem que se infiltrar na racionalidade jurídica por meio de uma alteração legal e não por meio de uma decisão de uma corte constitucional, que – neste caso – entende contrariamente àquilo que o próprio texto constitucional diz.

Não dá para pautar um debate extremamente relevante como este como se fosse um favor para este ou aquele. O que está se discutindo são os limites do poder de punir do Estado, que é a razão da existência do sistema criminal desse século 18. Seria importante o Congresso se debruçar sobre isso. E talvez até perceber que, dado o anseio da sociedade brasileira por uma dimensão de antecipação de pena, por uma necessidade resposta sancionatória, antecipar. Tudo bem. Mas isso não compete ao Poder Judiciário.

396,2,,"A reunião prevista para esta terça-feira (20) para discutir o impasse criado no STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) em torno da prisão de condenados em segunda instância não aconteceu e evidenciou a dificuldade de diálogo e o racha no Supremo.

O tema interessa à defesa do ex-presidente Lula, condenado em janeiro a 12 anos e um mês de prisão pela segunda instância da Justiça Federal por corrupção e lavagem de dinheiro no caso do tríplex em Guarujá (SP). Além de Lula, eventual mudança no entendimento do STF beneficiaria outros investigados na Operação Lava Jato.

Nesta quarta (21), o plenário da corte se reúne para a sessão de julgamentos e para uma reunião administrativa, que já estava marcada.

Há a possibilidade de algum ministro se manifestar sobre o assunto ou levantar uma questão de ordem apontando a conveniência de julgar as ações que tratam do assunto. Conforme revelou a Folha, o ministro Marco Aurélio Mello deve apresentar uma questão de ordem na sessão do tribunal para que a questão seja pautada imediatamente por Cármen Lúcia, presidente da corte.

A saída passou a ser considerada depois que a ministra se mostrou inflexível em não pautar o tema, evitando inclusive discutir com os colegas uma saída para o impasse —pelo menos cinco ministros defendem abertamente a revisão da regra.

As duas ADCs (ações declaratórias de constitucionalidade) que tratam do tema são de relatoria do ministro Marco Aurélio e foram liberadas para julgamento em dezembro, mas Cármen Lúcia não as incluiu na pauta de março nem de abril.

Uma ala dos ministros, incluindo Marco Aurélio, quer que o mérito das ações seja julgado logo, para que o Supremo dê uma palavra final sobre a execução provisória da pena e uniformize o entendimento nos julgamentos de habeas corpus, que hoje têm resultados diferentes a depender de quem os relata.

Celso de Mello não descarta mencionar o impasse em discurso. Como ministro mais antigo do tribunal, suas palavras costumam ter peso entre os colegas. Já Marco Aurélio cogita apresentar uma questão de ordem nesta quarta pedindo o julgamento das ADCs.

A presidente do STF havia anunciado na segunda (19), em entrevista a uma rádio de Minas, que haveria uma reunião informal entre os ministros, solicitada por Celso de Mello. Mas ao longo do dia os ministros declararam à imprensa que não foram convidados para o encontro.

Por horas, nem a assessoria de Cármen Lúcia nem a de Celso de Mello souberam dar informações sobre tal reunião, até que o decano se manifestou no meio da tarde.

“Se não houve convite pela presidência, isso significa que ela [Cármen Lúcia] não se mostrou interessada [em conversar]”, disse.

A assessoria de Cármen Lúcia informou, por outro lado, que ela aceitara o convite de Mello para uma reunião informal com os colegas, mas em nenhum momento ela entendeu que deveria ter feito os convites.

O decano disse que, na última quarta (14), sugeriu uma conversa entre os ministros para poupar Cármen Lúcia de uma cobrança pública que seria feita em plenário. Para ele, é incorreto dizer que há pressão sobre a ministra.

“Eu apenas me reuni com a presidente para evitar que na quinta-feira [15] houvesse cobrança pública dirigida a ela em sessão plenária. Para evitar que a presidente sofresse, digamos, uma cobrança inédita na história do Supremo que eu ponderei aos colegas que seria importante uma discussão interna”, disse.

Segundo Mello, a cobrança pública poderia ser, por exemplo, uma questão de ordem pedindo o julgamento das ações sobre prisão em segundo grau. “Talvez uma questão de ordem. Mas isso nunca aconteceu na história do Supremo. Ao menos nos quase 29 anos que estou aqui”, afirmou.

Na visão de alguns ministros que queriam a conversa, a presidente concordou com a ideia, mas, para surpresa deles, antes do tal encontro ela deu entrevista à GloboNews reafirmando sua decisão de não pautar o tema de maneira alguma. Eles disseram considerar que caíram em uma armadilha.

De um lado, Cármen é contra rever um entendimento firmado recentemente (em 2016), o que causaria insegurança jurídica e, em última análise, poderia gerar impunidade. De outro, colegas consideram que o Supremo não pode negar jurisdição, ou seja, deixar de se posicionar quando é provocado.

Um dos julgamentos previstos para esta quarta é sobre as conduções coercitivas —barradas no momento por liminar de Gilmar Mendes. Alguns dos advogados que atuam nesse processo são os mesmos que têm interesse na ação sobre prisão em segunda instância. Desse modo, se o plenário decidir julgar as ações, os interessados já estarão no plenário.

À tarde, um pequeno grupo de manifestantes protestou em frente ao STF. A maioria pedia para Cármen Lúcia resistir e não pautar a discussão, mas havia uma fração menor de militantes contrários à prisão de Lula.

397,2,,"O ministro Marco Aurélio Mello, do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal), deve apresentar uma questão de ordem na sessão de quarta (21) do tribunal para que a questão sobre prisão depois de condenação em segunda instância seja pautada imediatamente por Cármen Lúcia, presidente da corte.

A saída passou a ser considerada depois que a magistrada se mostrou inflexível em não pautar o tema, evitando inclusive discutir com os colegas uma saída para o impasse —pelo menos cinco ministros defendem abertamente a revisão da regra, proibindo a execução provisória da pena, e cinco se declaram contrários.

A própria Cármen Lúcia afirmou que uma reunião ocorreria na terça (20), por sugestão do decano do tribunal, Celso de Mello.

Mas ela não convidou ninguém para o encontro. Por meio de sua assessoria, disse não ter entendido que a iniciativa de chamar os colegas deveria partir dela.

A atitude, e as entrevistas concedidas na segunda (19) pela ministra a uma rádio e a uma TV, contrariaram os magistrados, que decidiram então partir para o enfrentamento da questão no plenário.

Caso a prisão depois de segunda instância seja revista, o ex-presidente Lula deverá ser diretamente beneficiado. Ele já foi condenado e corre o risco de ser preso assim que os embargos que apresentou ao TRF-4 (Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região) forem julgados, o que pode ocorrer na próxima semana.

Assim que a questão de ordem for levantada por Mello, o colegiado deve se pronunciar, por meio de votação.

Se o pedido for vitorioso, ele deve ser incluído na pauta da próxima sessão do Supremo, de acordo com magistrados que pretendem discutir o tema.

O ministro, que é relator de duas ações que discutem a constitucionalidade da prisão depois de condenação em segunda instância, já pretendia levantar a questão na semana passada.

Em conversa com o decano do tribunal, Celso de Mello, no entanto, chegou-se à conclusão de que a iniciativa emparedaria a ministra Cármen Lúcia: seria a primeira vez, em décadas, segundo declarou o próprio decano na terça (20) aos jornalistas, que tal situação ocorreria.

Diante do impasse, o embate pode mesmo ocorrer no plenário, caso Mello leve a ideia adiante.

C�pula das Am�ricas: os 12 servos do Grupo de Lima contra a Venezuela

O Grupo de Lima est� a postos para atacar Caracas durante a C�pula das Am�ricas

Ser�o 33 os chefes de Estado e de Governo que se reunir�o em Lima em abril para a 8ª C�pula das Am�ricas. Entre eles, 12 constituem o que o chamado Grupo de Lima, formado por iniciava do presidente peruano, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (PPK), com j� explicitado objetivo: apoiar a ofensiva ianque contra a Venezuela Bolivariana.

Por Gustavo Espinoza M.

Esse grupo j� se reuniu v�rias vezes e, em todas elas, em torno de uma agenda monotem�tica: atacar a administra��o de Caracas, atendendo os ditames da Casa Branca. As palavras de Donald Trump, estimulando essas iniciativas, se escuta forte desde que tomou posse. Ali�s, despreza todos os pa�ses ao sul do Rio Bravo, como se fossem seres inferiores.

Trump, de fato, disse h� pouco tempo que o Peru recebia “ajuda estadunidense�, e em troco enviava droga, ou seja, coca�na. Ocultou a verdade nua e crua de que os EUA s�o o maior consumidor de drogas no mundo e que, no contexto do livre mercado, os exportadores peruanos do setor encontraram seus melhores clientes.

Vale recordar que, em meados de 2016, quando ainda n�o tinham sido realizadas as elei��es nos EUA, PPK, j� ungido presidente, defendia a candidata Hillary Clinton, assegurando que a elei��o de Trump acarretaria enormes perigos para a regi�o. H� que admitir que nisso ele tinha raz�o.

Esses perigos est�o a�, crescendo. A diferen�a � que PPK a eles se somou. E concentraram contra a p�tria de Bol�var, considerando-a como ponto de in�cio para uma ofensiva generalizada sobre Nossa Am�rica em busca de petr�leo, min�rios e aqu�feros, al�m da riqu�ssima biodiversidade.

� evidente que a pol�tica de Trump nada tem de pessoal. Pessoal � seu estilo. No demais, a ess�ncia responde aos interesses dos grandes monop�lios, das corpora��es transnacionais, empenhadas em se apoderar do mundo para coloc�-lo a seu servi�o. Para elas, a guerra � apenas uma conting�ncia do processo hist�rico, consubstancial � natureza humana. Caso gere morte e destrui��o, consideram apenas danos colaterais. O importante ser� sempre o lucro financeiro que ela provoca.

Trump esteve um tempo entretido com o Iraque e, em seguida, se meteu numa virulenta guerra verbal contra o governo de Pyongyang. Os pr�prios coreanos, do Norte e do Sul, deram-lhe um chega pra l�. N�o querem mais continuar nessa guerra iniciada pelos EUA. Querem viver em paz, querem reconstruir a Rep�blica da Coreia como um s� pa�s.

O Donald de nossos dias deixou esse cen�rio e foi buscar novos. O dem�nio da vez � Nicol�s Maduro, que foi eleito de forma muito mais democr�tica do que o senhor Trumo. Mas a campanha contra encontra eco na imprensa e nos governos servis. Acusam a Maduro de tudo: ditador, m�os manchadas de sangue, assassino, ladr�o, que mata seu povo de fome…

Impressionante como atuam em un�ssono os redatores dos jornais, os apresentadores das televis�es. O mesmo texto apenas muda o sotaque de um pa�s para o outro. Ignoram as dificuldades inerentes a um processo de mudan�as profundas que afeta desde as institui��es do Estado at� os modos de produ��o mais simples. Afeta principalmente as classes que vivem da explora��o dos demais.

H� que ter um pouco de senso cr�tico para entender realmente como as coisas acontecem. O que a classe dominante diz hoje contra os que lideram processos de transforma��o do capitalismo e mais ainda contra os que conduzem processos libertadores � o mesmo que dizia a classe dominante contra Tupac Amaru, Tupac Katari, Tiradentes ou Zumbi dos Palmares. O mesmo que disseram contra San Martin e Sim�n Bol�var. O mesmo que disseram contra Sandino, Farabundo Marti, Fidel Castro e Che Guevara.

Eles se defendem atacando com mentiras, insultos, orientados apenas para encobrir a pol�tica criminosa e de rapina executada pelos exploradores em todo o continente. Disso, n�s, latino-americanos, temos muita viv�ncia.

Algu�m de ju�zo perfeito poderia acreditar que os ex-presidentes Alan Garc�a, Fujimori ou PPK, ou ainda, Temer ou Macri s�o gente honrada? Algu�m poderia afirmar que essa gente n�o t�m as m�os manchadas de sangue?

As matem�tica utilizada pelos mandat�rios de alguns pa�ses � curiosa. Uma d�zia resolve decidir contra a vontade de 33. Pior ainda, no Conselho de Seguran�a da ONU, onde cinco decidem contra toda a humanidade. Para esses doze, Maduro, isto �, a Venezuela, n�o � bem-vinda � reuni�o de abril e querem que se aplique a cl�usula “democr�tica� da OEA contra o pa�s fundante da independ�ncia sul-americana.

Que democracia � essa, senhor PPK? � a do d�lar? Seguramente festejaram e beijar�o os p�s do senhor Trump, convidado de honra dos vende-p�tria.

� que esses doze n�o se importam com o que digam ou pensem os demais mandat�rios de Nossa Am�rica. Importa s� o que eles querem, que � a vontade, ou a ordem que receberam durante a visita do ex-ministro de rela��es exteriores dos EUA, Rex Tillerson. Ele transmitiu a vontade de Trump e os doze �ulicos aceitaram.

Desrespeitar esse mandamento �, nas palavras do ditador, o �nico erro que algu�m com poder de comando n�o pode cometer jamais.

Por Alexandre Ganan de Brites Figueiredo*

Donald Trump, completando 14 meses � frente do governo dos Estados Unidos, faz uma incomum substitui��o na Secretaria de Estado visando a, dentre outras quest�es, corrigir as muitas vezes em que ordenou sem ser obedecido. E isso � um sinal de que tudo pode ficar ainda pior.

Rex Tillerson, at� ent�o secret�rio de Estado, foi dispensado via Twitter logo ap�s retornar de um giro por pa�ses africanos. S� algumas horas depois do an�ncio p�blico Trump lhe telefonou para comunicar a decis�o. Mesmo para um presidente com m�todos inusuais, tratou-se de uma grande descortesia. Humilhado, o at� ent�o poderoso chefe das rela��es exteriores dos EUA fez um pronunciamento em que agradece a todos, menos ao seu presidente. Uma fratura exposta no n�cleo duro do poder da maior pot�ncia militar do planeta.

Para seu lugar, Trump designou Mike Pompeo, diretor da CIA. Se a decis�o for confirmada pelo Senado, ser� a primeira vez que um chefe da espionagem (“y otras cosistas m�s�, t�o conhecidas por n�s, latino-americanos) comandar� tamb�m a diplomacia.

T�o incomum quanto a forma da dispensa de Tillerson e o pouco tempo que permaneceu em um cargo geralmente est�vel era sua rela��o com Trump. Em geral, sempre que o presidente abusava das palavras, o secret�rio aparecia na sequ�ncia com um “n�o � bem assim�. Na quest�o das amea�as � Venezuela, por exemplo, Tillerson procurou colocar panos quentes quando Trump disse, com todas as letras, que os EUA consideravam a possibilidade de um ataque militar ao pa�s para derrubar seu governo.

E n�o foi s� nessa vez que a falta de rumos na pol�tica externa norte-americana ficou expressa na rela��o entre o presidente e seu secret�rio. Quando Trump anunciou o reconhecimento de Jerusal�m como capital israelense, surpreendendo at� Israel, Tillerson recomendou modera��o. Mais recentemente, o presidente afirmou que lutaria contra a renova��o do acordo assinado entre EUA e Ir� ainda no governo Obama, mas Tillerson operou com outros membros do governo e do Congresso para manter o acordo.

No epis�dio do agravamento das tens�es no Oriente M�dio, no qual Ar�bia Saudita, Emirados �rabes, Bahrein e Egito romperam rela��es com o Catar (um entreposto norte-americano a vigiar os vizinhos aliados), Tillerson, apoiado tamb�m no Pent�gono, conteve a posi��o de Trump, que desejava apoiar o isolamento. �ltimo ato, o presidente mudou radicalmente sua posi��o sobre a Cor�ia do Norte e prop�s um encontro com Kim Jong-un sem sequer consultar a Secretaria de Estado, informada da decis�o por meio da imprensa.

Em outubro do ano passado, num epis�dio que mostra como deca�ram as lideran�as norte-americanas (quem achar que n�o, basta comparar com a seriedade de chineses e russos), Tillerson chamou Trump de idiota, em reuni�o com outros assessores. A resposta do presidente foi uma afirma��o – feita � imprensa - de que seu “QI� seria mais elevado que o de seu secret�rio. � assim que entre uma amea�a e outra contra pa�ses inteiros, os “falc�es� est�o envolvidos em discuss�es colegiais.

Ou seja, Trump tinha um secret�rio de estado que n�o estava alinhado com ele. Isso n�o quer dizer quer Tillerson, ex-presidente da Exxon Mobil, seja um pacifista imbu�do de sentimentos humanit�rios. Pelo contr�rio: sua recente viagem pela Am�rica do Sul nos mostra a natureza da sua pol�tica. Mas, quer sim dizer que Trump, isolado em seu pr�prio governo, buscar� cada vez mais apoio na ultradireita. O novo escolhido para o cargo de secret�rio de Estado � a mais recente evid�ncia disso. N�o � toa, seu an�ncio foi reverenciado pelo “Breitbart News�, voz noticiosa da extrema-direita norte-americana.

Antes de assumir a chefia da CIA, Mike Pompeo estava entre as mais proeminentes lideran�as do Tea Party no Congresso norte-americano. Defendia uma postura agressiva dos EUA nas rela��es internacionais e combatia a participa��o nos acordos sobre o clima. Se op�s � assinatura do acordo com o Ir� e, j� ocupando a CIA, definiu aquele pa�s como um “imp�rio pernicioso� em luta para expandir sua influ�ncia (e isso vindo da boca de um diretor da CIA...). Tem gosto por afirma��es fortes e vagas como “sejamos implac�veis� e “esmaguemos nossos inimigos�, como disse em passagem pelo Texas, no ano passado. Ou seja, uma verborragia um tanto inconsequente, muito ao estilo de Trump.

� verdade que “estilo� �s vezes quer dizer pouco. N�s aqui no Brasil vimos a postura diplom�tica de Celso Amorim levando adiante a firme defesa dos interesses brasileiros. Por outro lado, vimos tamb�m um Itamaraty nas m�os de Jos� Serra e Aloysio Nunes, carrancudos e falando grosso (com a Venezuela...), enquanto conduziam uma pol�tica extremamente cordial com os pa�ses ricos. Nos Estados Unidos,  Henry Kissinger, um cort�s professor de filosofia, foi talvez o mais duro secret�rio de Estado. Por sua vez, Hillary Clinton, sob Obama, com sorrisos nos l�bios conduziu uma pol�tica externa belicosa que elevou os gastos militares dos EUA a patamares in�ditos.

Se a ret�rica de Pompeo se converter� em uma diplomacia ainda mais agressiva por parte dos EUA, � algo a se confirmar. H� muito jogo de cena. No conflito com a Cor�ia do Norte, por exemplo, os meses de amea�as e agress�es verbais parecem, contradit�riamente aos an�ncios, ter chegado a um in�dito encontro entre os presidentes dos dois pa�ses (uma enorme vit�ria diplom�tica de Kim-Jun un). De todo modo, a posi��o enf�tica de Pompeo sobre o Ir�, aliada � oposi��o de Trump � renova��o do acordo, trazem fortes e renovados ventos de guerra.

Trata-se de um momento em que uma Washington ferida pelo fiasco de sua pol�tica na Guerra da S�ria procura recuperar protagonismo no Golfo P�rsico. At� o final de abril, a capital norte-americana receber� a visita do pr�ncipe Salman, governante de fato da �rabia Saudita, para conversas bilaterais. Na pauta, estar�o o Ir�, a S�ria e uma poss�vel c�pula com governantes do Golfo P�rsico. Esses movimentos se d�o no esteio da escalada das tens�es entre Israel e Ir�, desde fevereiro passado quando, em um epis�dio mal explicado, um ca�a israelense foi abatido na S�ria em resposta � derrubada de um drone iraniano. Se Pompeo e Trump quiserem mesmo a guerra, n�o lhes faltar�o pretextos.

Para a Am�rica Latina, a not�cia tampouco � boa.  Pompeo fala sem restri��es sobre sua simpatia pelas pol�ticas de “mudan�a de governo� (“regime change�) aplicadas pela CIA. No ano passado, ele enalteceu publicamente a atua��o do servi�o secreto na busca pela derrubada do governo de Nicol�s Maduro, alegando coisas como a presen�a de agentes iranianos e do Hezbollah na Venezuela. Em um ano de elei��es importantes no continente, � de se esperar que a vis�o e os m�todos da CIA agora abarquem ainda mais a atua��o externa norte-americana.

J� na disputa interna que tomou conta de Washington, Trump vai, aos poucos, mais � vontade no cargo, assumindo as r�deas de seu governo. At� ent�o, o poder na Casa Branca passava por uma tr�ade capaz de anular o presidente: Tillerson, John Kelly (Chefe de Gabinete) e Jim Mattis (Secret�rio da Defesa), sendo os dois �ltimos generais da reserva, ambos “marines�. Um senador republicano, Bob Corker, presidente do poderoso comit� de rela��es exteriores do Senado norte-americano, chegou a dizer que os tr�s eram as pessoas que separavam os EUA do caos.

Agora, Trump ter� um secret�rio mais pr�ximo de si e esse “equil�brio� poder� ser rompido. Mike Pompeo na Secretaria de Estado � uma indica��o de que o “America First� � mesmo a resposta violenta de um gigante acuado e temeroso ante um mundo que se redefine.

No epis�dio do agravamento das tens�es no Oriente M�dio, no qual Ar�bia Saudita, Emirados �rabes, Bahrein e Egito romperam rela��es com o Catar (um entreposto norte-americano a vigiar os vizinhos aliados), Tillerson, apoiado tamb�m no Pent�gono, conteve a posi��o de Trump, que desejava apoiar o isolamento. �ltimo ato, o presidente mudou radicalmente sua posi��o sobre a Cor�ia do Norte e prop�s um encontro com Kim Jong-un sem sequer consultar a Secretaria de Estado, informada da decis�o por meio da imprensa.

Em outubro do ano passado, num epis�dio que mostra como deca�ram as lideran�as norte-americanas (quem achar que n�o, basta comparar com a seriedade de chineses e russos), Tillerson chamou Trump de idiota, em reuni�o com outros assessores. A resposta do presidente foi uma afirma��o – feita � imprensa - de que seu “QI� seria mais elevado que o de seu secret�rio. � assim que entre uma amea�a e outra contra pa�ses inteiros, os “falc�es� est�o envolvidos em discuss�es colegiais.

Ou seja, Trump tinha um secret�rio de estado que n�o estava alinhado com ele. Isso n�o quer dizer quer Tillerson, ex-presidente da Exxon Mobil, seja um pacifista imbu�do de sentimentos humanit�rios. Pelo contr�rio: sua recente viagem pela Am�rica do Sul nos mostra a natureza da sua pol�tica. Mas, quer sim dizer que Trump, isolado em seu pr�prio governo, buscar� cada vez mais apoio na ultradireita. O novo escolhido para o cargo de secret�rio de Estado � a mais recente evid�ncia disso. N�o � toa, seu an�ncio foi reverenciado pelo “Breitbart News�, voz noticiosa da extrema-direita norte-americana.

Antes de assumir a chefia da CIA, Mike Pompeo estava entre as mais proeminentes lideran�as do Tea Party no Congresso norte-americano. Defendia uma postura agressiva dos EUA nas rela��es internacionais e combatia a participa��o nos acordos sobre o clima. Se op�s � assinatura do acordo com o Ir� e, j� ocupando a CIA, definiu aquele pa�s como um “imp�rio pernicioso� em luta para expandir sua influ�ncia (e isso vindo da boca de um diretor da CIA...). Tem gosto por afirma��es fortes e vagas como “sejamos implac�veis� e “esmaguemos nossos inimigos�, como disse em passagem pelo Texas, no ano passado. Ou seja, uma verborragia um tanto inconsequente, muito ao estilo de Trump.

� verdade que “estilo� �s vezes quer dizer pouco. N�s aqui no Brasil vimos a postura diplom�tica de Celso Amorim levando adiante a firme defesa dos interesses brasileiros. Por outro lado, vimos tamb�m um Itamaraty nas m�os de Jos� Serra e Aloysio Nunes, carrancudos e falando grosso (com a Venezuela...), enquanto conduziam uma pol�tica extremamente cordial com os pa�ses ricos. Nos Estados Unidos, Henry Kissinger, um cort�s professor de filosofia, foi talvez o mais duro secret�rio de Estado. Por sua vez, Hillary Clinton, sob Obama, com sorrisos nos l�bios conduziu uma pol�tica externa belicosa que elevou os gastos militares dos EUA a patamares in�ditos.

Se a ret�rica de Pompeo se converter� em uma diplomacia ainda mais agressiva por parte dos EUA, � algo a se confirmar. H� muito jogo de cena. No conflito com a Cor�ia do Norte, por exemplo, os meses de amea�as e agress�es verbais parecem, contradit�riamente aos an�ncios, ter chegado a um in�dito encontro entre os presidentes dos dois pa�ses (uma enorme vit�ria diplom�tica de Kim-Jun un). De todo modo, a posi��o enf�tica de Pompeo sobre o Ir�, aliada � oposi��o de Trump � renova��o do acordo, trazem fortes e renovados ventos de guerra.

Trata-se de um momento em que uma Washington ferida pelo fiasco de sua pol�tica na Guerra da S�ria procura recuperar protagonismo no Golfo P�rsico. At� o final de abril, a capital norte-americana receber� a visita do pr�ncipe Salman, governante de fato da �rabia Saudita, para conversas bilaterais. Na pauta, estar�o o Ir�, a S�ria e uma poss�vel c�pula com governantes do Golfo P�rsico. Esses movimentos se d�o no esteio da escalada das tens�es entre Israel e Ir�, desde fevereiro passado quando, em um epis�dio mal explicado, um ca�a israelense foi abatido na S�ria em resposta � derrubada de um drone iraniano. Se Pompeo e Trump quiserem mesmo a guerra, n�o lhes faltar�o pretextos.

Para a Am�rica Latina, a not�cia tampouco � boa. Pompeo fala sem restri��es sobre sua simpatia pelas pol�ticas de “mudan�a de governo� (“regime change�) aplicadas pela CIA. No ano passado, ele enalteceu publicamente a atua��o do servi�o secreto na busca pela derrubada do governo de Nicol�s Maduro, alegando coisas como a presen�a de agentes iranianos e do Hezbollah na Venezuela. Em um ano de elei��es importantes no continente, � de se esperar que a vis�o e os m�todos da CIA agora abarquem ainda mais a atua��o externa norte-americana.

J� na disputa interna que tomou conta de Washington, Trump vai, aos poucos, mais � vontade no cargo, assumindo as r�deas de seu governo. At� ent�o, o poder na Casa Branca passava por uma tr�ade capaz de anular o presidente: Tillerson, John Kelly (Chefe de Gabinete) e Jim Mattis (Secret�rio da Defesa), sendo os dois �ltimos generais da reserva, ambos “marines�. Um senador republicano, Bob Corker, presidente do poderoso comit� de rela��es exteriores do Senado norte-americano, chegou a dizer que os tr�s eram as pessoas que separavam os EUA do caos.

Agora, Trump ter� um secret�rio mais pr�ximo de si e esse “equil�brio� poder� ser rompido. Mike Pompeo na Secretaria de Estado � uma indica��o de que o “America First� � mesmo a resposta violenta de um gigante acuado e temeroso ante um mundo que se redefine.

Col�mbia, M�xico e Brasil podem alterar cen�rio latino, diz Ramonet

Ign�cio Ramonet v� com otimismo o panorama eleitoral da Am�rica Latina

H� dez anos, os pa�ses latino-americanos ocupavam papel de destaque na conjuntura internacional, com for�as de esquerda e progressistas no comando de diversas na��es da regi�o. Hoje, o retrato da Am�rica Latina � bem diferente. Golpes, derrotas eleitorais e avan�o do projeto neoliberal s�o algumas das marcas deste novo momento.

“Ainda assim, n�o devemos ser pessimistas�, acredita Ignacio Ramonet, jornalista e soci�logo espanhol, que, em entrevista, analisou o panorama latino-americano e indicou possibilidades de cen�rios num futuro pr�ximo.

“H� muitas elei��es neste ano, s�o oito grandes elei��es de presidentes na Am�rica Latina. E h� dois pa�ses em que, se as atuais pesquisas forem confirmadas, o panorama pol�tico da Am�rica Latina mudaria�, aponta o diretor de reda��o do Le Monde Diplomatique na Espanha.

Ramonet p�e luz nas elei��es presidenciais da Col�mbia e do M�xico, onde, apesar de serem exce��es da onda mais � esquerda da d�cada passada, t�m atualmente pesquisas que indicam que candidatos progressistas podem se tornar os futuros mandat�rios.

O jornalista espanhol posiciona o Brasil neste cen�rio, em especial analisando a persegui��o que Luiz In�cio Lula da Silva vem sofrendo, o que poderia acarretar no impedimento de sua candidatura � Presid�ncia.

“Eu espero que Lula possa ser candidato e ganhe brilhantemente. Se o Lula ganha no Brasil, [Gustavo] Petro na Col�mbia e [Andr�s Manuel] L�pez Obrador no M�xico, teremos outra d�cada muito positiva, com uma economia que logo estar� come�ando a funcionar. Eu desejo isso profundamente�, afirmou.

Confira trechos da entrevista:

Qual � a situa��o da Am�rica Latina hoje em compara��o com a �ltima d�cada?

H� dez anos, t�nhamos um panorama latino-americano espetacular, porque era o continente onde o maior grupo de pa�ses estava governado pela esquerda. Em nenhum outro continente tinha tantas for�as de esquerda governando com programas de transforma��o social. No Brasil, na Venezuela, no Equador, na Bol�via, no Uruguai, na Argentina e, em parte, no Chile.

Hoje em dia, o panorama � muito diferente por diversas raz�es. Se pegamos esses mesmos pa�ses que acabo de citar, no Brasil, h� um golpe institucional e uma direita neoliberal. Na Argentina, o kirchnerismo e o peronismo progressista perderam as elei��es; Macri voltou a ganhar recentemente nas elei��es legislativas. Na Venezuela, h� um ataque brutal, com guerra econ�mica, midi�tica, financeira, com contrabando para suprimir os medicamentos, a comida; o pa�s est� submetido a um ataque brutal. E, na Bol�via, que est� muito bem governada, acontecer� elei��o neste ano, mas [o presidente] Evo Morales perdeu o referendo ano passado. E o Uruguai, sim, � governado pela Frente Ampla, saiu o [Pepe] Mujica, entrou Tabar� [V�zquez], eleito. Ent�o, como podemos explicar isso? Certamente existem v�rias explica��es, eu vou tentar propor a minha.

Na Am�rica Latina, todos os pa�ses, exceto um, t�m a mesma economia que da �poca colonial. Os pa�ses latino-americanos n�o souberam modificar sua estrutura econ�mica. Desde a era colonial, s�o pa�ses especializados na exporta��o de algumas mat�rias, essencialmente do setor prim�rio, do solo ou do subsolo, produ��es agr�colas ou minerais. Quando os pre�os dessas mat�rias est�o altos, a sociedade passa a demandar, consciente ou inconsciente, a divis�o na distribui��o desses benef�cios econ�micos. Isso aconteceu depois dos anos 1920, p�s-Primeira Guerra Mundial; aconteceu nos anos 1950, depois da Segunda Guerra Mundial; e, desta vez, na d�cada antecedente, os pre�os das mat�rias-primas estavam muito altos, subiram ao longo dos anos 2000. E por que subiram? Porque a China tinha uma economia baseada na ideia de que era a f�brica do mundo. E, consequentemente, para fabricar todo e qualquer objeto, necessitava muita mat�ria-prima. A China estava crescendo a 10%, 11%, importava massivamente os produtos minerais e agr�colas da Am�rica Latina. Isso enriqueceu enormemente esses pa�ses e chegam os governos progressistas, que ganham as elei��es.

Ent�o, temos, por um lado, o crescimento econ�mico e governos que distribu�ram esse crescimento. Os governos de esquerda coincidem na abund�ncia de recursos que podiam distribuir. E todos esses governos fizeram o mesmo: alfabetizaram a sociedade, escolarizaram, multiplicaram as pol�ticas de sa�de, de moradia. Cada um tem seu pr�prio programa: Fome Zero no Brasil, Misiones Milagro e Misiones Barrio Adentro na Venezuela. Criaram uma pol�tica muito popular que respondia �s necessidades da sociedade. O que chamamos de d�vida social, que foi acumulada durante s�culos nesses pa�ses.

H� outra pergunta que pode ser pol�tica ou geopol�tica: Por que os Estados Unidos, que nunca permitiram que um governo progressista chegasse ao poder na Am�rica Latina, democraticamente ou n�o democraticamente, permitiram que isso acontecesse aqui? N�o h� um exemplo na Am�rica Latina, no Caribe, na Am�rica Central e na Am�rica do Sul, de um governo progressista que realmente pretendesse transformar a sociedade que n�o tivesse que resistir � vontade dos Estados Unidos de derrub�-lo. Voc�s conhecem a hist�ria da Guatemala, em 1954; de Cuba, em 1961, que resistiu, evidentemente, em circunst�ncias muito dif�ceis; contra Goulart, no Brasil, em 1964; contra Juan Bosch na Rep�blica Dominicana, em 1965; contra Salvador Allende e a Unidade Popular, [no Chile] em 1973; contra Torrijos e Noriega no Panam�, em 1989; Granada, em 1982, etc.

Provavelmente, porque, quando Lula chega ao poder, os Estados Unidos est�o mobilizados no Oriente M�dio e na Guerra do Iraque, com 500 mil soldados, e n�o podem ter tr�s frentes, podem ter duas. N�o h� d�vida de que n�o podemos imaginar que a exist�ncia de governos progressistas na Am�rica Latina tenha sido poss�vel e que os Estados Unidos tenham ficado passivos, isso � imposs�vel. Acontece que n�o podiam fazer outra coisa, porque estavam mobilizados em outro lugar.

Mas quando os dois fatores, crescimento e distanciamento dos Estados Unidos, se modificam, quando j� n�o h� nada a ser distribu�do por causa da crise e quando os Estados Unidos concentram o ataque sobre a Am�rica Latina, as coisas mudam. Esses governos perdem as elei��es, algo que aconteceu em todos os lugares: na Argentina; Correa perdeu as elei��es municipais no Equador; Evo Morales perdeu o referendo na Bol�via; perderam a elei��o legislativa na Venezuela. Claro que em cada pa�s � diferente, mas globalmente vemos que aconteceu em todos os lados. E esses governos t�m menos para distribuir.

A� tamb�m est� presente a ideia de que muita gente que se beneficiou durante os governos progressistas n�o reconhe�a esses benef�cios, pelo contr�rio, continua cobrando mais pol�ticas sociais que os governos j� n�o podem criar, porque n�o t�m recursos por causa da crise.

Hoje temos um panorama muito diferente do que t�nhamos dez anos atr�s, em que j� n�o � sistem�tica a vit�ria das for�as progressistas. Ainda assim, n�o devemos ser pessimistas.

E, tendo em vista que neste ano teremos elei��es em diversos pa�ses, como Brasil, Venezuela, Col�mbia, Paraguai, M�xico, entre outros, qual o cen�rio que se aponta?

H� muitas elei��es neste ano, s�o oito grandes elei��es de presidentes na Am�rica Latina. E h� dois pa�ses em que, se as atuais pesquisas forem confirmadas, o panorama pol�tico da Am�rica Latina mudaria.

O primeiro � a Col�mbia, onde o principal candidato, segundo as pesquisas, � um dirigente progressista, o [Gustavo] Petro, que j� foi prefeito de Bogot�. Pela primeira vez, a Col�mbia n�o seria governada pela direita liberal ou pela direita conservadora. Seria um governo muito diferente na perspectiva dos Acordos de Paz, porque a Farc [For�a Alternativa Revolucion�ria do Comum] n�o vai apresentar um candidato. Isso j� altera a rela��o com a Col�mbia, altera a rela��o no resto da Am�rica Latina, porque a Col�mbia � hoje o principal aliado militar dos Estados Unidos, ent�o as coisas podem mudar.

O segundo, mais importante ainda, � o M�xico. O principal candidato, com cerca de 17 pontos de diferen�a, � Andr�s L�pez Manuel Obrador, que � candidato pelo partido que se chama Morena, � esquerda do PRI [Partido Revolucion�rio Institucional]. Bem, n�o estamos aqui para qualificar se � mais de esquerda que Lula ou menos de esquerda que Ch�vez, mas s�o partidos que chegam pela primeira vez ao poder, com programas de transforma��o social. O M�xico precisa disso, porque tanto o PRI quanto o PAN [Partido de A��o Nacional, ambos partidos revezam na Presid�ncia mexicana] n�o souberam governar, � quase um Estado falido. E, al�m disso, o pa�s foi atacado, humilhado, pelo presidente dos Estados Unidos, com a constru��o do muro. Ent�o, se no M�xico e na Col�mbia esses resultados forem confirmados, n�s dir�amos que hoje, na Am�rica Latina, h� uma perspectiva de que a esquerda tome a dianteira.

Como o que vem acontecendo no Brasil, em especial, a poss�vel n�o candidatura do Lula, impactaria internamente o pa�s e, principalmente, os pa�ses da regi�o?

Evidentemente o Brasil � central, � o pa�s mais importante da Am�rica Latina, n�o h� d�vidas. O Brasil tem uma influ�ncia em escala internacional. Al�m disso, os governos de Lula e Dilma colocaram o Brasil entre a elite internacional. O Brasil faz parte dos BRICS, que foi criado quando Lula era presidente. Brasil, R�ssia, �ndia, China e �frica do Sul, os grandes pa�ses emergentes, onde est�o alguns dos l�deres mundiais, como a R�ssia e a China. O Brasil faz fronteira com quase todos os pa�ses da Am�rica do Sul, ent�o, o que acontece no Brasil repercute em todas as partes.

� preciso lembrar que o primeiro presidente progressista depois de Ch�vez, foi o Lula. Lula foi eleito em 2002, assumiu em 2003 e essa articula��o Lula-Ch�vez teve uma grande influ�ncia na regi�o. Consequentemente, toda a opera��o do golpe de Estado contra Dilma, o golpe institucional, a batalha agora jur�dica contra Lula, que quer evitar que ele possa ser candidato, enquanto ele aparece como preferido em todas as pesquisas eleitorais, e enquanto Lula � o presidente mais admirado entre todos os outros. Lula fez 40 milh�es de brasileiros sa�rem da pobreza. Ningu�m no mundo inteiro, em nenhum momento da hist�ria, tirou 40 milh�es da pobreza em t�o pouco tempo. Al�m disso, como diz Lula, ele, que nunca foi � universidade, criou n�o sei quantas universidades, vinte universidades no pa�s.

Ent�o, n�o � preciso sequer defender Lula, porque ele j� est� na hist�ria, como Mandela est� na hist�ria, como Gandhi est� na hist�ria. Lula � um presidente internacional, � um �cone mundial. Ent�o os ju�zes, os meios de comunica��o, as for�as pol�ticas que se op�em ao Lula, v�o parar na lata do lixo da hist�ria, porque o Lula n�o sair� da hist�ria.

Eu espero que Lula possa ser candidato e ganhe brilhantemente. Se o Lula ganha no Brasil, Petro na Col�mbia e L�pez Obrador no M�xico, teremos outra d�cada muito positiva, com uma economia que logo estar� come�ando a funcionar. Eu desejo isso profundamente, porque a Am�rica Latina precisa que Lula seja o pr�ximo grande presidente do Brasil.

H� mais brasileiros na Venezuela que venezuelanos no Brasil, diz ONU

Aeroporto de Caracas, na Venezuela: mais brasileiros est�o em solo venezuelano que o contr�rio

O Relat�rio Internacional de Migra��o de 2017, divulgado pelo Departamento das Na��es Unidas para Assuntos Econ�micos e Sociais (DECA, na sigla em ingl�s), apontou que o n�mero de brasileiros vivendo na Venezuela � maior do que venezuelanos vivendo no Brasil. A conta � feita em cima dos dados absolutos.

Por Lucas Estanislau

Segundo o documento, 0,02% da popula��o total da Venezuela � formada por brasileiros, totalizando 6.119 imigrantes do Brasil vivendo no pa�s. J� o n�mero de venezuelanos vivendo no Brasil � de 3.515 pessoas, aproximadamente 0,001% da popula��o brasileira. Al�m de brasileiros, o n�mero de cidad�os de outras nacionalidades que est�o vivendo na Venezuela tamb�m supera o n�mero de venezuelanos que habitam seus pa�ses.

De acordo com o relat�rio, a Argentina abriga 1.286 venezuelanos, cerca de 0,003% da popula��o argentina, enquanto que 10.098 argentinos vivem na Venezuela, somando 0,03% da popula��o venezuelana.

Em rela��o ao total de venezuelanos – que vivem no seu pa�s de origem ou n�o – aproximadamente 0,01% moram no Brasil. Para esse c�lculo � levado em conta a popula��o total que vive na Venezuela, menos o n�mero de imigrantes morando no pa�s, mais os venezuelanos que vivem fora de seu pa�s de origem. Em rela��o ao total de brasileiros, o mesmo c�lculo (popula��o no Brasil – imigrantes de outros pa�ses + brasileiros no mundo) d� 0,002%.

No caso da Argentina, cerca de 0,004% do total de venezuelanos pelo mundo vivem no vizinho latino-americano. Comparando o n�mero de argentinos pelo mundo, cerca de 0,02% vivem na Venezuela.

Para o professor de Rela��es Internacionais da Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Gilberto Rodrigues, esse processo pode ser explicado pela pol�tica de “acolhimento� do pa�s. “A Venezuela tem sido um pa�s de acolhimento de migrantes, tanto migrantes econ�micos, quanto for�ados, ou seja, pessoas refugiadas�, afirma.

Segundo o professor, “os governos social-democratas da Venezuela sempre concederam asilo para muitos imigrantes latino-americanos, inclusive acolhendo pessoas perseguidas pelas ditaduras militares da Am�rica do Sul e Central�.

Col�mbia

Outro pa�s da Am�rica Latina que possui mais cidad�os vivendo na Venezuela do que abrigando cidad�os venezuelanos � a Col�mbia. Aproximadamente 0,1% da popula��o colombiana � constitu�da por imigrantes venezuelanos, totalizando 49.829 pessoas. J� na Venezuela, vivem 988.483 colombianos, cerca de 3,1% da popula��o.

“No caso da Col�mbia, milhares de colombianos se refugiaram na Venezuela devido � guerra civil de mais de cinco d�cadas naquele pa�s�, afirmou Rodrigues.

Estes n�meros n�o representam a movimenta��o de imigrantes: mostram sim o n�mero de imigrantes que vivem em determinado local, n�o sendo poss�vel falar em fluxo migrat�rio. Segundo o DECA, para fazer o c�lculo apresentado no relat�rio, � levado em conta o n�mero de imigrantes que morreram, quantos imigrantes entraram e quantos sa�ram de determinado pa�s, dentre outros fatores.

Norte e Sul

O relat�rio ainda apontou que a quantidade de imigrantes vivendo em pa�ses em desenvolvimento – considerados pelo crit�rio da ONU como pa�ses do Sul – aumentou 3,2% entre 2000 e 2017, superando os �ndices de pa�ses desenvolvidos – considerados pelo crit�rio da ONU como pa�ses do Norte.

Em 17 anos, pa�ses considerados desenvolvidos registraram 1,6% de aumento em seu estoque de imigrantes, exatamente a metade dos �ndices alcan�ados pelos pa�ses do Sul.

As regi�es em desenvolvimento registraram um crescimento exponencial ao longo da pesquisa. Entre 1990 e 2000, a taxa do estoque de imigrantes vivendo em pa�ses do Sul era de -0,1%, crescendo para 2,6% entre 2000 e 2010.

Dez pa�ses com mais imigrantes

Segundo o relat�rio das Na��es Unidas, o mundo possui um total de 258 milh�es de imigrantes (dados de 2017), por�m mais da metade do total de imigrantes est� em apenas dez pa�ses. De acordo com o levantamento, 51% do estoque de imigrantes no mundo vivem nesses dez pa�ses, todos considerados desenvolvidos.

Os Estados Unidos lideram o ranking com 49,8 milh�es de imigrantes, ou 19% do n�mero total, seguidos por Ar�bia Saudita e Alemanha, ambos com 12,2 milh�es de imigrantes, R�ssia, que abriga 11,7 milh�es, e Reino Unido, com 8,8 milh�es.

Para o professor, estes n�meros se explicam peo fato de esses pa�ses possuem grande capacidade de absor��o dos imigrantes no mercado de trabalho. Alguns deles, no entanto, n�o oferecem boas condi��es trabalhistas. “A Ar�bia Saudita � um pa�s riqu�ssimo que atrai m�o de obra da �sia para atuar em projetos de infraestrutura, embora n�o ofere�a condi��es de trabalho e de vida dignas para esses imigrantes�, diz Rodrigues.

Avi�o joga veneno sobre fam�lias de sem terra acampadas no PA

O Acampamento Helenira Resende, do Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST), foi atacado por um avi�o que despejou agrot�xico nas fam�lias acampadas na tarde deste s�bado (17), no sudeste do Par�.

Por Marcos Aur�lio Ruy*

De acordo com informa��es da Central dos Trabalhadores e Trabalhadoras do Brasil, se��o Par� (CTB-PA), muitas pessoas passaram mal com a pulveriza��o.

Em novembro de 2017, as fam�lias acampadas foram despejadas de uma das fazendas do Complexo Cedro, vinculado ao grupo Agropecu�ria Santa B�rbara, no qual o latifundi�rio, banqueiro Daniel Dantas faz parte. As fam�lias seguem acampadas na fazenda ao lado do antigo acampamento e j� come�am a sofrer os primeiros ataques neste ano.

Cleber Rezende, presidente da CTB-PA, afirma que a situa��o est� muito tensa na regi�o. “Estamos vivendo momentos muito dif�ceis no pa�s e no Par� por causa da aus�ncia de um Estado que re�na condi��es de intervir nos conflitos e defender os direitos da classe trabalhadora�.

Pelo contr�rio, “o Estado � parcial e protege os grandes grupos econ�micos e seus interesses�, denuncia. Nesse contexto, Rezende v� o assassinato do l�der comunit�rio Paulo S�rgio Almeida Nascimento na segunda-feria (12) e da vereadora Marielle Franco na quarta-feira (14) como frutos dessa pol�tica do governo golpista contra a classe trabalhadora.

Ele explica que o governador Sim�o Jatene (PSDB) “n�o tem a m�nima condi��o de mediar esses conflitos com a isen��o necess�ria�, por isso, reafirma, “precisamos pedir a interven��o da ONU (Organiza��o das Na��es Unidas) como a �nica forma de garantir a vida das pessoas�.

Para o sindicalista paraense, “quem joga agrot�xico dessa maneira brutal em fam�lias acampadas pode fazer qualquer barb�rie�. Por isso, “a CTB-PA defende a interven��o da ONU par garantir a seguran�a e os direitos de quem trabalha e produz�.

De acordo com ele, “n�s trabalhamos contra a especula��o imobili�ria e por isso lutamos para garantir uma reforma agr�ria que d� terras para as fam�lias de camponeses poderem produzir alimentos�.

Em v�deo, procurador dos EUA admite parceria informal com Lava Jato

Um v�deo divulgado pela defesa de Lula nesta sexta-feira (16) confirma que os Estados Unidos ajudaram a Lava Jato na ""constru��o de casos"" que atingiram pol�ticos, agentes p�blicos, executivos e as grandes empreiteiras brasileiras.

Por C�ntia Alves

Segundo o modus operandi, a troca de informa��es que iniciou a instru��o de inqu�ritos foi feita totalmente � margem do Minist�rio da Justi�a, respons�vel por encaminhar os pedidos de coopera��o internacional. A autoridade central s� era acionada para formalizar a parceria e validar as provas quando a investiga��o j� estava pronta, a caminho do tribunal.

As informa��es sobre a dobradinha dos procuradores brasileiros com os EUA foram reveladas por Kenneth Blanco, ent�o vice-procurador geral adjunto do Departamento de Justi�a dos Estados Unidos (DOJ), durante um evento realizado em julho de 2017, para discutir as ""li��es"" do Brasil no combate � corrup��o.

Por volta dos 8 minutos, Blanco deixou claro como funcionava o esquema: ""No come�o de uma investiga��o, um procurador ou um agente de uma unidade financeira de um pa�s, pode ligar para seu parceiro estrangeiro e pedir informa��o financeira como, por exemplo, identifica��o de contas banc�rias. Uma vez que a investiga��o tenha chegado ao ponto em que os procuradores est�o prontos para levar o caso ao tribunal, as provas podem ser requeridas atrav�s do canal de assist�ncia jur�dica m�tua para que possam ser aceitas como provas durante o julgamento.""

""Essa coopera��o de procurador para procurador, de um �rg�o se guran�a para outro �rg�o de seguran�a, tem permitido que ambos os pa�ses processem seus casos de maneira mais efetiva"", justificou Blanco.

Na sequ�ncia, ele ainda acrescentou que toda a parceria se baseou n�o em tratados internacionais, mas em ""confian�a"". ""Tal confian�a (...) permite que promotores e agentes tenham comunica��o direta quanto �s provas. Dado o relacionamento �ntimo entre o Departamento de Justi�a e os promotores brasileiros, n�o dependemos apenas de procedimentos oficiais como tratados de assist�ncia jur�dica m�tua, que geralmente levam tempo e recursos consider�veis para serem escritos, traduzidos, transmitidos oficialmente e respondidos.""

Mas, ""ao que se tenha conhecimento, inexiste qualquer registro da participa��o do Minist�rio da Justi�a na coopera��o confessada pelos agentes norte-americanos.""

""Diante dessa nova prova, a defesa pediu [ao Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Regi�o] que o Minist�rio P�blico Federal seja notificado a esclarecer essa inusitada forma de coopera��o sem a observ�ncia dos 'procedimentos oficiais' e baseada na 'confian�a' especificamente sobre o caso de Lula"", apontou a defesa.

Venezuela � o pa�s que mais constr�i casas populares no mundo

Depois de entregar 2 milh�es de moradias populares, o governo da Venezuela pretende ir al�m e entregar mais 5 milh�es nos pr�ximos anos, para zerar o d�ficit habitacional do pa�s

Nos �ltimos sete anos, o governo da Venezuela construiu dois milh�es de casas populares como parte do sistema de prote��o social ao povo venezuelano.

Nesta ter�a-feira (20), o governo da Venezuela atingiu a cifra de dois milh�es de casas constru�das atrav�s do programa de moradia popular Grande Miss�o Vivenda. O presidente, Nicol�s Maduro, fez um ato pol�tico para a entrega desta nova leva de moradias no conjunto habitacional Mirador de Caiza, no estado de Miranda. Na ocasi�o, ele tamb�m anunciou o projeto de expans�o do programa, criado em abril de 2011 pelo ent�o presidente Hugo Ch�vez. Este ano ser�o constru�das mais 500 mil moradias.

Por�m, a pr�xima meta do governo bolivariano � construir 5 milh�es de casas para entregar � popula��o mais pobre do pa�s. “Constru�mos quase duas casas por dia desde que nasceu esta miss�o. N�o existe pa�s no mundo que tenha constru�do tanto quanto os governos de Hugo Ch�vez e agora de Maduro�, destacou o ministro da Comunica��o e Informa��o, Jorge Rodr�guez.

O programa Grande Miss�o Vivenda funciona como uma esp�cie de Minha Casa, Minha Vida, do Brasil e era um dos principais ideais do comandante da revolu��o bolivariana, Hugo Ch�vez. Desde que assumiu a presid�ncia, Nicol�s Maduro tem mantido o compromisso do ex-presidente com a popula��o mais pobre.

O programa Miss�o Vivenda � considerado o maior �xito de pol�tica habitacional da hist�ria do pa�s e um dos maiores do mundo. Est� baseado em cinco pilares: povo, terreno, materiais, financiamento e execu��o.

Mercadante: Temer quer 40% do ensino m�dio na iniciativa privada

Em entrevista ao Brasil 247, o ex-ministro da Educa��o do governo Dilma, Aloizio Mercadante criticou a medida que o governo de Michel Temer est� colocando em pratica de liberar at� 40% da carga hor�ria total do ensino m�dio para ser realizada � dist�ncia. Para a educa��o de jovens e adultos, a proposta � permitir que 100% do curso seja fora da escola.

A reforma do ensino m�dio, aprovada em 2017, tamb�m abriu a brecha ao ensino online — possibilidade vetada anteriormente. O golpe do governo federal vem depois de Temer cortar dinheiro para a Educa��o.

""Esta proposta vai contra tudo que vinha sendo constru�do para o fortalecimento e a recupera��o do ensino m�dio. Tamb�m representa a entrega de 40% da parcela que � destinada ao ensino m�dio dentro do Fundeb, que tem uma proje��o de R$ 140 bilh�es, neste ano"", explicou Mercadante.

O ex-ministro refor�ou que o ensino m�dio � considerado o maior desafio da educa��o brasileira. ""Com 87% das matr�culas concentradas nas redes estaduais e com um curr�culo enciclopedista, que dialoga pouco com a diversidade de interesses dos estudantes, o ensino m�dio apresenta os piores resultados nos indicadores de qualidade na educa��o, como no caso Ideb"", afirma.

Ao comentar sobre a decis�o do governo em colocar 40% do ensino m�dio � dist�ncia, Mercadante afirmou que Temer coloca os estudantes na contra-m�o.

""O modelo de excel�ncia do ensino m�dio � oposto a estas imposi��es arbitr�rias. S�o exatamente as escolas de tempo integral, como os Institutos Tecnol�gicos Federais, que no �ltimo exame do Pisa, Programa Internacional de Avalia��o de Alunos, para jovens de 15 anos, implementado pela OCDE, em 2015, se fossem considerados um pa�s, ficariam em 2º lugar em Linguagem, 11ª em ci�ncias e 30º em matem�tica, entre os 70 pa�ses mais ricos do planeta"", destacou.

Mercadante lembrou ainda que a escola � um ambiente do conhecimento, do conv�vio com a diversidade, da cultura e da forma��o, tendo como complementa��o da forma��o o ensino das artes e educa��o f�sica.

""A escola, especialmente nesta faixa et�ria, deve preparar para a vida em um sentido amplo, familiar, social e profissional. Especialmente em um momento como este, com a viol�ncia e as drogas t�o presentes nas periferias das grandes cidades, a exclus�o da escola � um imenso e perigoso retrocesso. Com essa proposta do governo Temer, o que estar� vigente ser� o esvaziamento do ambiente escolar"", enfatizou.

Para ele, Temer reduz a jornada obrigat�ria do curr�culo, que � de 2,4 mil horas, para 1,8 mil horas, uma redu��o maior do que estava prevista na proposta anterior da Base Comum.

""Al�m disso, as �nicas disciplinas obrigat�rias s�o o portugu�s e a matem�tica. A mudan�a proposta pelo governo Temer reduz os direitos de aprendizagem dos estudantes ao que couber nas 1,8 mil horas"", destaca Mercadante, dizendo ainda que n�o se trara de ser contra as novas tecnologias digitais na educa��o, que � fundamental no ensino � dist�ncia.

""Acontece que essas novas tecnologias devem ser utilizadas como complemento das escolares, ou seja, para aprimorar a rela��o professor-aluno, a participa��o e enriquecer a jornada escolar, n�o para tirar os alunos da escola. E o pioro na proposta de Temer � que tudo isso � proposto sem o devido controle de qualidade e com um forte processo de privatiza��o da educa��o"", apontou.

De acordo com Mercadante, a vis�o neoliberal do estado m�nimo e de privatiza��o dos servi�os p�blicos est� sendo implantada, tamb�m no ensino m�dio, com estas medidas. ""Esse � o plano de fundo dessa proposta, que permitir� que os 40% do ensino m�dio a dist�ncia sejam oferecidas pela iniciativa privada"".

Imunes ao ajuste fiscal do governo Temer, que destr�i direitos da popula��o, os ricos e privilegiados patrocinam a m�dia para acobertar o desastre.

Por Marcio Pochmann

A grav�ssima recess�o que atingiu a economia brasileira produziu efeitos muito desiguais. Para a maioria do conjunto dos setores das atividades econ�micas, a recess�o implicou queda no n�vel de produ��o ou at� mesmo redu��o na capacidade de produ��o (desinvestimento), acompanhada da redu��o no faturamento e na taxa m�dia de lucro.

Em fun��o disso, por exemplo, setores industriais e da constru��o civil amargaram diminui��o significativa no n�vel de produ��o e emprego de m�o de obra. A participa��o da ind�stria de manufatura no Produto Interno Bruto recuou ao observado na d�cada de 1910.

Por outro lado, os maiores bancos no pa�s (Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, Ita� Unibanco e Santander Brasil) registram eleva��o de 21% nos lucros que somam quase R$ 65 bilh�es somente no ano passado. A atua��o do Banco Central como uma esp�cie de sindicato dos banqueiros ajuda a entender como foi contida a queda na taxa b�sica de juros (Selic), sem qualquer compromisso com o emprego e renda dos brasileiros.

A preval�ncia da ineg�vel alta na taxa de juros reais tamb�m favoreceu, bem como permitiu reproduzir – ainda mais – o segmento rentista, ou seja, aqueles que vivem da aplica��o de sua riqueza no sistema financeiro. No ano de 2016, por exemplo, os rendimentos financeiros alcan�aram a soma de R$ 141,7 bilh�es, o que equivaleu a 2,2 vezes mais do que o registrado em 2013 (R$ 65,8 bilh�es), segundo informa��es do pr�prio Minist�rio da Fazenda.

Para isso, o Banco Central elevou a taxa b�sica de juros de 7,25% no ano de 2013 para 14,25% at� 2016. Ao mesmo tempo em que inibia o conjunto das atividades econ�micas, produzindo a mais grave recess�o entre os brasileiros, o Banco Central protegia os muito ricos com capital a desviar das atividades produtivas para as aplica��es financeiras.

N�o satisfeito com o benepl�cito do Banco Central aos ricos, o Minist�rio da Fazenda manteve intoc�vel o atual sistema tribut�rio regressivo, o que permitiu prosseguir com os privil�gios aos detentores de fortunas no pa�s. No ano de 2017, por exemplo, a renda advinda de lucros e dividendos que alcan�ou a soma de R$ 350,3 bilh�es permaneceu imune ao pagamento do imposto de renda, ao contr�rio dos assalariados, cuja renda mensal superior a R$ 2 mil (R$ 24 mil ano) implica contribui��o ao fisco.

Trabalhadores perderam emprego, tiveram rebaixamento do n�vel de renda, mas o peso dos impostos sobre os mais pobres seguiu intoc�vel pela equipe econ�mica do governo Temer. Assim como a elite dos servidores p�blicos com rendimentos anuais acima de R$ 600 mil (R$ 52,5 mil por m�s), e que representa apenas 1% dos quase 5 milh�es de funcion�rios p�blicos federais, seguiu detendo isen��o tribut�ria de um ter�o de sua renda auferida ao ano (R$ 58,7 bilh�es).

A presen�a de adicionais � remunera��o b�sica, como aux�lio-moradia, entre outros, constitui benef�cio tanto para se proteger de crises econ�micas como a recess�o quanto manter imune � tributa��o que atinge, sobretudo, os mais pobres no Brasil. A grande faixa de isen��es tribut�rias se constitui agravante do processo de reprodu��o da b�rbara desigualdade de renda e riqueza.

Todo o movimento de ajuste fiscal produzido pelo governo Temer, que tem destru�do direitos sociais do conjunto da popula��o, passa � margem dos ricos e privilegiados do pa�s. Talvez por isso que os propagandistas sustentados por bancos e meios de comunica��o destacam o quanto a equipe econ�mica � a do sonho do mercado financeiro.

Com desemprego recorde, aumentam golpes e falsas ofertas de trabalho

O n�mero recorde de 12,7 milh�es de desempregados no Brasil – o maior desde 2012 - tem deixado os trabalhadores e trabalhadoras mais vulner�veis a golpes e explora��es.

Por Rosaly Rocha para Portal CUT

Tem de tudo na pra�a, desde an�ncios que oferecem  vagas inexistentes, com bons sal�rios e benef�cios; a empresas que, em troca da vaga, cobram de R$ 2 mil a R$ 8 mil por ano dos trabalhadores para que comprem roupas da lojas que ser�o usadas como uniformes. Tem tamb�m empresas que cobram por cursos e treinamentos e depois dizem n�o ter emprego nenhum.

Isso � crime. A procuradora Eliane Lucina, do Minist�rio P�blico do Trabalho de S�o Paulo (MPT-SP), orienta os trabalhadores e trabalhadoras a procurarem o sindicato de suas categorias sempre que desconfiarem ou forem v�timas de golpes e fraudes.

Segundo ela, a fraude, na maioria das vezes, � feita antes do contrato de trabalho ser assinado e os sindicatos est�o habilitados a fazer a den�ncia no MPT.

Os golpistas est�o sujeitos a dois processos: um de ordem civil e outro, penal. “O civil � uma a��o p�blica aberta pelo MPT por delito trabalhista. De ordem penal, os envolvidos podem ser processados criminalmente por estelionato, vantagem il�cita, falsidade ideol�gica e fraude na Justi�a comum�.

O MPT-SP n�o tem pesquisas com dados mais concretos, mas pelas den�ncias que o �rg�o tem recebido, a procuradora Eliane Lucina diz que “o n�mero de golpes a trabalhadores realmente vem aumentando com o desemprego�.

E os exemplos de explora��o e golpes se multiplicam em todo pa�s. Em S�o Paulo, a procuradora est� trabalhando em uma den�ncia de uma vendedora de uma grande rede de lojas, que foi obrigada a comprar a nova cole��o de roupas da pr�pria loja para come�ar a trabalhar. Ela s� trabalhou um m�s, na �poca do Natal, e gastou cerca de R$ 2 mil na compra de roupas que n�o precisava, conta Eliane Lucina.

“Para piorar, a loja n�o desconta o valor no contracheque, obriga seus funcion�rios a pagarem com o pr�prio cart�o de cr�dito�, diz a procuradora, que abriu sindic�ncia contra a rede de lojas, cujo nome s� poder� revelar quando a empresa for notificada.

Para os homens que trabalham na mesma loja, a rede exige camisa social, mais cara que as camisas polos.  “S�o quatro cole��es ao ano. Se pegar como exemplo os R$ 2 mil em compras de uma s� cole��o, os funcion�rios chegam a gastar R$ 8 mil ao ano. Um peso muito grande no or�amento�, diz a procuradora.

Segundo ela, um exemplo recente de golpe aconteceu em Bras�lia. Cada trabalhador pagou R$ 50 por uma vaga  numa empresa que n�o existia.

Outro golpe comum � quando a empresa oferece sociedade, mas na verdade o trabalhador est� sendo contratado como PJ – pessoa jur�dica.

“Tive um caso contra uma Cl�nica de Olhos que obrigou uma enfermeira a abrir uma empresa. Depois, ela descobriu que a Cl�nica colocou todos os funcion�rios registrados na sua empresa. No caso, ela foi ‘laranja’ sem pr�vio conhecimento�, contou a procuradora Eliane Lucina.

- Empresas que fazem treinamento pr�vio com vendas. O trabalhador vende os produtos durante uma semana e ao final n�o � contratado. Trabalhou de gra�a nesse per�odo;

- Empresas que oferecem baixos sal�rios e altas comiss�es, mas as metas s�o inating�veis e o trabalhador nunca consegue receber sua comiss�o. Quando a meta � atingida, o trabalhador descobre que n�o tem nenhum documento escrito e a empresa aumenta a meta;

- Ag�ncias de emprego cobram taxas para encaminhamento de vagas;

- Vagas em troca de cursos. Empresas oferecem vagas desde que o trabalhador fa�a um curso pago para conseguir o emprego. Depois do curso, ele descobre que a vaga n�o existe.

O trabalhador que quiser fazer uma den�ncia deve entrar no site do Minist�rio P�blico:  www.mpt.mp.br  e escolher o estado onde o golpe est� ocorrendo.

Em S�o Paulo a den�ncia pode ser feita no MPT-SP pelo site  www.prt2.mpt.mp.br

O presidente norte-americano Donald Trump, atualmente se preocupa pelo fato da Rússia ter conseguido restaurar o equilíbrio estratégico de poder que garante em caso de ataque de uma parte, a resposta imediata da outra, resultando na destruição total de ambos os países.

'Não é blefe, é realidade': oficial russo diz que Moscou tem armas só vistas antes em filmesSegundo opina o analista militar russo, Viktor Murakhovsky, as preocupações de Donald Trump são provocadas pela Rússia ter conseguido estabelecer, de novo, o equilíbrio das forças estratégicas e, ao mesmo tempo, não violar o Tratado de Redução de Armas Estratégicas (START III), que foi firmado entre URSS e EUA.

Anteriormente, o jornal The New York Times informou, citando um alto funcionário norte-americano que preferiu não ser identificado, que Donald Trump expressou durante a conversa telefônica com o presidente da Rússia, Vladimir Putin, suas preocupações quanto ao desenvolvimento de armas russas que podem superar os meios de defesa estadunidense.

""As preocupações de Trump são claras, sendo que os novos tipos de armas estratégicas, que a Rússia recentemente apresentou ao mundo durante o discurso de Vladimir Putin, anulam todo o sistema de defesa de mísseis dos EUA e de outros países, que tentam desenvolver esses sistemas.""

""No entanto, esses tipos de armas não violam o acordo que limita o número de armas estratégicas START III que está em vigor entre Rússia e EUA, e também o Tratado INF [Tratado de Forças Nucleares de Alcance Intermediário]"", indicou o especialista.

Assim, destacou sem ultrapassar os limites existentes, a Rússia deu um passo qualitativo que lhe permitiu anular todos os esforços dos EUA e outros países em torno do desenvolvimento de sistema de defesa antimíssil global.

""Só os parâmetros qualitativos mudam-se, e não os quantitativos"", afirmou, adicionando que isso permite ao país a aumentar significativamente as capacidades da sua defesa.

""De fato, nós [Rússia] restauramos o equilíbrio estratégico que existia entre a URSS e EUA, e existe agora entre Rússia e EUA a nível que garante uma destruição mútua [em caso de conflito armado]"", concluiu.

Em seu discurso para a Assembleia Federal (parlamento bicameral da Rússia) em 1º de março de 2018, o presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, falou sobre um leque de novos armamentos que a Rússia começou a produzir recentemente. Além de revelar o míssil balístico intercontinental mais moderno Sarmat e a nova tecnologia a laser de defesa aérea, o presidente russo apresentou três sistemas revolucionários de armas projetadas para enfrentar as capacidades dos EUA.

O chefe do Ministério da Defesa norueguês, Frank Bakke-Jensen, durante o encontro com seu homólogo norte-americano, James Mattis, expressou preocupações devido ao ""comportamento agressivo"" da Rússia perto das fronteiras do reino. O titular acrescentou que Oslo está seguindo atentamente o desenvolvimento das Forças Armadas russas.

Além disso, Bakke-Jensen, citado pela edição VG, assinalou que são as manobras russas nas proximidades da Noruega que causam uma preocupação especial.

""Durante os exercícios a Rússia deslocou um grande número de tropas ao norte do país em prazos muito curtos. Além disso, para junto da fronteira norueguesa foram transferidos sistemas de mísseis russos"", afirmou o ministro da Defesa.

Nova 'ameaça russa' para Noruega: 'ataques' aéreos substituem os navaisAnteriormente, o chefe da inteligência militar norueguesa, Morten Haga Lunde, afirmou que os militares russos simularam em 2017 ataques contra o país. Além disso, o funcionário de alto escalão confessou que Oslo tem dificuldade em detectar os submarinos russos modernos.

Por sua vez, Moscou desmente todas as acusações deste tipo.

Finalmente inventaram uma caneca que não deixa seu café esfriar

A rede norte-americana Starbucks lançou recentemente um produto que vai rapidamente virar o desejo de muitos #coffeelovers de plantão. Em parceria com a startup de tecnologia Ember, eles desenvolveram uma caneca inovadora, capaz de manter o café aquecido pelo tempo que você desejar. Batizada com o mesmo nome da startup, a caneca, disponível em dois modelos, começou a ser desenvolvida em 2010, e funciona graças a uma bateria interna com autonomia de 2 horas, além de possuir sensor Bluetooth e se conectar com smartphones através de um aplicativo. É através do app, inclusive, que é possível regular a temperatura do café.  Seu design simples é outro diferencial. Desenvolvido em parceria com a empresa Ammunition Group, responsável pela marca de fones de ouvido Beats by Dre, a caneca é clean, elegante e não possui nenhum botão aparente. Se interessou? Infelizmente, a Ember só está à venda nos Estados Unidos e Canadá, sendo possível adquirir a caneca tanto em algumas cafeterias Starbucks quanto no próprio site da startup.The Adobe Flash Player is required for video playback.

418,1,,"(TNS) Columbus, Ohio, expects to finish outfitting police officers with body cameras this summer, six months ahead of schedule.

More than 850 officers already are wearing the cameras, which the city began purchasing in late 2016, and a total of about 1,300 should begin using them by the end of June.

Originally, officials expected the rollout to run through the end of 2018. But implementation ""has proceeded very smoothly,"" Bob Stewart, assistant director in the Department of Public Safety, told Columbus City Council members last week.

Columbus selected WatchGuard Video of Allen, Texas, as its vendor for 1,575 body cameras and accessories in December 2016 after Mayor Andrew J. Ginther promised during his 2015 campaign that he would bring the technology to the Division of Police.

""From the earliest days of his administration, Mayor Ginther has made the implementation of body-worn cameras a top priority because they are an important tool to enhance public safety,"" said Robin Davis, Ginther's spokeswoman.

The cost of the rollout at that time was expected to be about $9.1 million over five years, including the equipment, training, server space to store video and licensing fees. About $3.6 million was for cameras and $4.1 million for data storage.

So far, the city is ahead of schedule and under budget, said George Speaks, assistant director of public safety.

Last year, the city spent about $4.5 million on body-camera implementation, including about $1.6 million for the cameras and $1.3 million for storage. Running fiber-optic cable to police substations through which officers can upload video was cheaper than expected, costing about $706,000, said Speaks, the department's chief architect for the body-camera program.

""I think the implementation has gone very well,"" he said. ""Part of that is all of the work that we did at looking where cities failed their implementation.""

Speaks said the Columbus Police Training Academy also has been able to expedite the training of officers to operate the cameras by using an instructional video, which is getting the cameras to officers faster.

The city initially equipped about a dozen police officers with the cameras. Bike and traffic patrol officers were the first to get them, followed by new police recruits.

As of Tuesday, 869 officers had body cameras, Speaks said.

Last year, the city budgeted to hire seven people to deal with body-camera footage. They included people to deal with records requests to police and additional staff in the city attorney's office to handle a new bank of evidence.

The 2017 budget anticipated the seven workers to have salaries totaling about $326,000.

City Attorney Zach Klein said his office has hired only two of the four workers originally anticipated. Those two have been working on acquiring footage, searching hours-long videos for specific interactions and cutting down the footage for prosecutors, he said. With more cameras coming online, he said, he is working with the administration to determine whether additional staffing is needed.

The camera footage is showing the ""unvarnished truth"" of what happens in police interactions, Klein said.

""It is a wise investment because it protects the community and police, and having sunshine on this process and police interactions is good for all parties involved,"" he said.

Speaks said the city is evaluating whether the staff it has hired is sufficient to deal with the additional workload the cameras create. Those jobs could be affected by proposed rules for when body-camera video will be released to the public, which is pending in the legislature.

A bill introduced in November is still in committee, according to the Legislative Service Commission.

Implementing the cameras has mostly been smooth, but some minor problems have cropped up, said Jason Pappas, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge No. 9. For example, lights on some cameras wouldn't turn off when officers were supposed to use them in ""stealth mode,"" such as during a SWAT situation, he said.

Police officers, though, are growing accustomed to the new technology, Pappas said.

419,1,,"You shouldn't have to do this. You shouldn't have to wade through complicated privacy settings in order to ensure that the companies with which you've entrusted your personal information are making reasonable, legal efforts to protect it. But Facebook has allowed third parties to violate user privacy on an unprecedented scale, and, while legislators and regulators scramble to understand the implications and put limits in place, users are left with the responsibility to make sure their profiles are properly configured.

Over the weekend, it became clear that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company, got access to more than 50 million Facebook users' data in 2014. The data was overwhelmingly collected, shared, and stored without user consent. The scale of this violation of user privacy reflects how Facebook's terms of service and API were structured at the time. Make no mistake: this was not a data breach. This was exactly how Facebook's infrastructure was designed to work.

In addition to raising questions about Facebook's role in the 2016 presidential election, this news is a reminder of the inevitable privacy risks that users face when their personal information is captured, analyzed, indefinitely stored, and shared by a constellation of data brokers, marketers, and social media companies.

Tech companies can and should do more to protect users, including giving users far more control over what data is collected and how that data is used. That starts with meaningful transparency and allowing truly independent researchers—with no bottom line or corporate interest—access to work with, black-box test, and audit their systems. Finally, users need to be able to leave when a platform isn’t serving them — and take their data with them when they do.

Of course, you could choose to leave Facebook entirely, but for many that is not a viable solution. For now, if you'd like keep your data from going through Facebook's API, you can take control of your privacy settings. Keep in mind that this disables ALL platform apps (like Farmville, Twitter, or Instagram) and you will not be able to log into sites using your Facebook login.

Log into Facebook and visit the App Settings page (or go there manually via the Settings Menu > Apps ).

From there, click the ""Edit"" button under ""Apps, Websites and Plugins."" Click ""Disable Platform.""

If disabling platform entirely is too much, there is another setting that can help: limiting the personal information accessible by apps that others use. By default, other people who can see your info can bring it with them when they use apps, and your info becomes available to those apps. You can limit this as follows.

From the same page, click ""Edit"" under ""Apps Others Use."" Then uncheck the types of information that you don't want others' apps to be able to access. For most people reading this post, that will mean unchecking every category.

421,1,,"An overhaul of Capitol Hill’s workplace misconduct system is in jeopardy and likely won’t be attached to a government spending bill this week, diminishing the likelihood of reform before the midterm elections, according to Politico.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who introduced the bipartisan Congressional Harassment Reform Act last December, said on Monday that House and Senate leadership “stripped” provisions from the language from the spending bill at the eleventh hour.

“I am appalled that House and Senate leadership removed provisions from the omnibus bill at the last minute that would have finally brought accountability and transparency to Congress’s sexual harassment reporting process,” said Gillibrand in a statement released Monday.

Among its provisions, the act requires that members of Congress personally pay for sexual harassment settlements when they are found liable. Currently, lawmakers can tap taxpayer funds to settle with victims. Also, unless the victim opts for privacy, under the act, settlements would automatically be made public, thus lifting the veil of secrecy around the process.

The provisions, noted Gillibrand, passed unanimously in the House, and the act has broad support in the Senate.

“It begs the question: Who are they trying to protect? I can’t think of any legitimate reason to remove this language other than to protect members of Congress over taxpayers and congressional employees,” said Gillibrand, who on Monday called on the Senate leadership to bring the legislation to the floor for an immediate vote.

Congress is facing a Friday midnight deadline to approve its spending bill. And on Monday, Politico cited sources who reported that the harassment measure was unlikely to get attached to the spending bill, a shift that “jeopardizes” the chances that the bill would move forward and onto President Trump’s desk for a signature.

However, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), disputed Gillibrand’s account that provisions of the act were on track to be included in the spending bill, according to Politico.

“The government funding bill is still being developed, so I don’t have any update on the final bill,”  spokesman Don Stewart told Politico in an email. “And while this important issue is being discussed, at no time was language from Sen. Gillibrand’s bill adopted to the legislation and/or stripped.”

Gillibrand has been one of the most outspoken critics of Capitol Hill’s sexual harassment complaint process, calling the system “broken” and urging her colleagues to take action.

“Congress should never be able to play by their own set of rules or ever be above the law,” Gillibrand told CNN last November.

Others have called the system antiquated. For example, accusers must first agree to counseling and mediation before they may file a lawsuit, according to the Washington Post.

Recently, reporters have uncovered several cases where members of Congress used taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment complaints filed by former staff members

Last month, in urging Senate leadership to take action on her bill, Gillibrand reminded her colleagues that an overhaul of the system is urgent. “The more time that goes by without addressing this broken system, the more people suffer,” Gillibrand wrote in a letter to McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

423,1,,"É verdade que a vereadora Marielle Franco já foi casada com o traficante Marcinho VP e engravidou dele aos 16 anos? Veja essas e outras fake news envolvendo a vereadora!

O assunto se espalhou através das redes sociais na segunda quinzena março de 2018, poucos dias após o assassinato da vereadora – ocorrido no centro do Rio de Janeiro. De acordo com o texto, Marielle Franco teria engravidado do traficante Marcinho VP, aos 16 anos de idade, além de ter sido eleita pelo Comando Vermelho e ter exonerado seis de seus funcionários recentemente.

A ideia da publicação que foi disseminada na web é a de mostrar que a vereadora teria vários motivos para ser morta por criminosos (e não pela Polícia)! Ou seja, a vítima teria sido a culpada pela sua própria morte…

Será que essas informações são reais?

Marielle Franco tinha 38 anos de idade quando foi assassinada no Rio de Janeiro, em 2018. Defensora dos direitos humanos, a vereadora vinha denunciando abusos por parte da Polícia Militar nas comunidades.

Não encontramos nada que confirme (e nem que desminta) que a mulher era usuária de maconha (detalhe esse que, se fosse verdade ou não, não justificaria a sua morte).

Marielle teve uma filha, Luyara, quando tinha 19 anos (e não 16 como espalharam por aí).

Não há nenhuma informação sobre algum casamento da falecida em nenhuma reportagem a respeito dela. O Wikipedia não cita nenhum cônjuge (seja ele atual ou ex).

O fato é que uma busca por “Marcinho VP” retornam duas respostas. Há pelo menos dois traficantes conhecidos com o”Marcinho VP”:

* , traficante de drogas que atua no Complexo do Alemão

O primeiro, morreu em 2003, aos 33 anos de idade, no presídio Bangu3 onde estava preso desde 2000. Nessa época, Marielle Franco tinha 19 anos e morava no Complexo da Maré. Já o traficante, antes de ser preso, comandava a favela Santa Marta – que fica a cerca de 20 km de distância da casa da moça. Parece ser pouco provável que eles foram casados nessa época, dada a distância entre eles e a total falta de provas desse enlace.

No caso do outro “Marcinho VP” (o traficante do Complexo do Alemão), a possibilidade dele ter se casado com a vereadora também é mínima, visto que ele está preso desde 1997 e – igualmente como ocorreu no caso do Marcinho da favela Santa Marta – não há nenhuma prova de que ele tenha se casado com a vítima!

Outra informação espalhada pela web afirma que a vereadora teria sido eleita pelo Comando Vermelho. No entanto, uma busca por fontes a respeito e apenas encontramos aqueles mesmos sites de sempre que já conhecemos por espalhar notícias falsas.

Buscando através de uma fonte confiável – no caso, o site do Tribunal Regional Eleitoral do Rio de Janeiro – podemos perceber que Marielle Franco foi a quinta mais votada da cidade, com maiores quantidades de votos vindos de bairros como Leblon, Copacabana e Ipanema. Como podemos ver nesse recorte de um infográfico do portal G1 abaixo, as comunidades onde o Comando Vermelho atua sequer aparecem no ranking:

Se a vereadora tivesse sido eleita mesmo graças ao Comando Vermelho, certamente as comunidades comandadas por essa facção teriam maior representatividade na eleição de Marielle.

Esse rumor se espalhou de tal maneira que até pessoas públicas caíram nessa, como a desembargadora do TJ-RJ Marília Castro Neves, que publicou em sua conta no Facebook acusações contra a então recém-assassinada Marielle Franco:

Em entrevista à jornalista Mônica Bergamo, da Folha de São Paulo, a desembargadora disse que – apesar de publicar um desabafo “como uma cidadã“ – ela apagou a sua publicação e disse explicou que apenas comentou o “que ouviu de uma amiga” e que não conhecia a vereadora até saber da sua morte!

Não encontramos nenhuma notícia a respeito de exonerações determinadas pela vereadora “recentemente” (e nem tão recentemente).

Essas afirmações feitas contra a vereadora morta a tiros no Rio de Janeiro surgiram em grupos do WhatsApp e não tem nenhuma prova que as sustentem!

426,1,,"Two students who survived last month’s high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., said Monday that the leadership of the National Rifle Association (NRA) has “basically threatened” them since they started speaking out about gun violence.

“I think it just goes to prove exactly what they are. I don’t think NRA members are bad people at all. I think they’re responsible gun owners that want to become politically active and make their voices heard in this democracy,” David Hogg told CBS News.

“I think the problem comes in when it’s people at the top of this organization that don’t listen to their constituents, and continue to scare people into buying more guns, creating more violence so they can scare more people and sell more guns,” he added.

Hogg and classmate Emma González appeared on CBS News on Monday to talk about their efforts to promote stricter gun laws and prevent school shootings.

When asked if the NRA has reached out to the Parkland students in the month since they rallied to stop school shootings, Hogg said the way they’ve reached out “is basically threatening us.”

“They’ve been instigating things,” González added. “And then we reply, they shy away. Like they can dish it out, but they can’t take it.”

The NRA hasn’t publicly criticized the Parkland students since the shooting, but during last week’s national day of school walkouts to protest gun violence, the organization shared a photo of a rifle with the caption “I’ll control my own guns, thank you.”

Hogg, González and other Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students have been at the forefront of the discussion about gun violence following the Feb. 14 shooting at the high school that left 17 people dead.

Since then, some lawmakers have expressed support for various legislation, including stronger background checks, an increased age limit on buying rifles and a ban on bump stocks.

So far, Congress has not passed any legislation. The Trump administration earlier this month unveiled a series of proposals on school safety and gun restrictions, including a push for states to provide firearms training for school staff members.

The proposal did not include any action on guns, but established a committee to assess best practices for preventing school shootings.

428,1,,"The scene near an explosion in Austin.

Three package bombs have gone off in Austin, Texas, in the past two weeks, and they appear to have targeted members of prominent black families, the president of the local NAACP told NBC News Wednesday.

The families of Stephen House, who was killed on March 2, and Draylen Mason, who was killed on Monday, have known each other for a long time “and go to the same church,” according to Nelson Linder. The Austin NAACP president said that a third bomb, which injured 75-year-old Esperanza Herrera, may have been intended for “another person who might be connected to the House and Mason families.”

Though the Austin police agree that the bombings are related, they haven’t suggested a motive. They also haven’t said whether they think the victims were personally targeted. But interim Austin police chief Brian Manley did tell reporters this week that they’re not ruling out the possibly “that hate crime is at the core of this.”

Mason, 17, was a musician who was set to enroll at the University of Texas Butler School of Music. His grandmother LaVonne Mason is a co-founder of the Austin Area Urban League. House, 39, was a father and founder of his own money-management firm. His stepfather, Freddie Dixon, who is close with Mason’s grandparents, was the longtime pastor at Wesley United Methodist Church, a historic black church that was founded by newly freed slaves.

Dixon told the Washington Post that he doesn’t think the victims’ history is a coincidence. “Somebody’s done their homework on both of us, and they knew what they were doing,” he said. “My diagnosis: Number one, I think it’s a hate crime. Number two, somebody’s got some kind of vendetta here.”

Investigators have begun looking into the connection between the Mason and House families, attempting to see if the victims’ relationships to “prominent members of Austin’s African-American community” is related to the bombings, the Austin American-Statesman reported on Wednesday.

As for the third bomb, police have a theory that it was meant for a woman who is not related to the Mason family, but shares their last name.

The bombs themselves provide some clue as to who may have delivered them. According to ABC News, the explosives “displayed a level of sophistication, indicating that the bomb-maker or bomb-makers were highly skilled.”

The devices were set up to be detonated by motion like shaking or jostling, which is why they exploded when they were picked up. The devices also had some sort of safety switch, which enabled the bomber to move the devices without blowing themselves up, the sources briefed on the investigation told ABC News.

As police continue their probe into the bombings, a sense of unease has come over the city as Austinites prepare for another potential bombing. And they remain vigilant. Since Monday, there have been nearly 500 reports of suspicious packages in the city. None of them have contained explosives.

The appalling portrait Jim Carrey posted Saturday is just the latest lewd artwork the 56-year-old star has released of late, many of them assailing Republican lawmakers and members of President Donald Trump’s administration.

Jim Carrey faced swift backlash Sunday after the actor tweeted a painting that apparently showed White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in a terrifyingly garish light.

“This is the portrait of a so-called Christian whose only purpose in life is to lie for the wicked. Monstrous!” Carrey wrote in his tweet accompanying the portrait Saturday.

Though Carrey didn’t mention Sanders by name, many Twitter users knew right away who it was, The Wrap reported.

No entanto, Maitê ficou grávida e não queria ter as crianças. Ela queria continuar investindo no trabalho de atriz. Em recente entrevista, Proença disse que por essa e por outras é a favor do aborto no Brasil. Dessa forma, as mulheres mais pobres teriam o apoio do Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) e isso evitaria que algo mais grave acontecesse com elas.

A afirmação foi feita devido ao tema do programa, “Crianças que não se identificam com o sexo que nascem”, em referência à personagem Ivana, interpretada por Carol Duarte, de “A Força do Querer”.

De acordo com Fátima, ainda existe muito preconceito e falta de informação sobre o assunto. Se depender dela, autores devem abordar o tema com o público infanto juvenil.

432,1,,"A questão posta é ao mesmo tempo curiosa e delicada. De uns tempos para cá, sempre que você chega no andar onde mora, sente um cheiro muito forte de maconha. E vem do apartamento de seu mais novo vizinho. E esse cheiro o incomoda muito.

O que fazer?

Primeiramente, cabe esclarecer que o condômino que se sente incomodado com o “cheiro” advindo do apartamento vizinho não pode, em um primeiro momento, afirmar que se trata de maconha sem ter uma prova cabal.

Em segundo lugar, não sendo comprovada tal afirmação, o referido condômino, que acusou o seu vizinho, poderá, eventualmente, ser processado por danos morais em razão da falsa imputação que lhe foi feita.

É melhor, neste caso, fazer uma reclamação por escrito ao síndico, do condomínio, para que se tome as providências necessárias, como uma notificação, junto ao vizinho em questão, para que este cesse o mau cheiro proveniente da sua unidade.

Se persistirem os odores, reclame novamente até que o síndico passe a emitir boletos com multa para o vizinho infrator. Segundo o disposto no art. 1.277 do Código Civil em vigor, o proprietário ou o possuidor de um prédio tem o direito de fazer cessar as interferências prejudiciais à segurança, ao sossego e à saúde dos que o habitam, provocadas pela utilização de propriedade vizinha, considerando-se, nesta hipótese, que o odor prejudicial advindo do interior do imóvel vizinho se mostra insuportável ao morador prejudicado.

433,1,,"""Isso me levou a abraçar o submundo do crime como profissão. A quadrilha começou a fazer inúmeros assaltos para se armar porque percebia que cada de um de nós poderia ser o próximo a morrer. E todas as vezes que aqueles policiais militares entravam na Vila Norma era um pega para capar retado, tiroteio para todo lado.""

""Parei no Alemão, na Mangueira, em Vigário Geral, no Jacarezinho. Parei em várias comunidades do Rio de Janeiro. Eu praticava grandes assaltos e comprava armas para os chefes do tráfico das comunidades e eu fiquei com certa fama, ganhei certa ascendência como líder, mas chefe do tráfico eu nunca fui. Trafiquei na Vila Norma quando tinha 17 anos"", diz.

Não é o que diz a Polícia Civil do Rio de Janeiro. Quando foi preso em Porto Alegre, em agosto de 1996, pouco antes de completar 21 anos, ele era considerado o chefe do tráfico no Complexo do Alemão. Mais de duas décadas de prisão não mudaram essa realidade, afirmam relatórios de Inteligência da SSP-RJ (Secretaria da Segurança Pública do Rio de Janeiro).

À época de sua prisão era comum a imprensa confundi-lo com outro Marcinho VP, mais famoso do que ele. Márcio Amaro de Oliveira comandava o tráfico no Morro da Santa Marta, na zona sul do Rio de Janeiro, onde Michael Jackson gravou cenas do clipe da música ""They Don't Care About Us"". Ele teve sua trajetória retratada pelo jornalista Caco Barcellos no livro ""Abusado"". Dois meses após o lançamento do livro, em julho de 2003, o Marcinho da Santa Marta foi estrangulado no presídio de Bangu III. Seu corpo foi encontrado dentro de uma lixeira.

Investigações policiais apontaram o Marcinho VP do Complexo do Alemão como um dos possíveis mandantes do assassinato do xará de apelido. ""Um absurdo, um descalabro. Eu não tinha motivo algum para querer vê-lo morto. Éramos amigos, companheiros de galeria"".

Marcinho VP do Complexo do Alemão teve seu nome envolvido em outra morte de traficante ocorrida dentro de um presídio. Em 11 de setembro de 2002, Marcinho VP e Fernandinho Beira-Mar comandaram uma rebelião no presídio de Bangu 1, que resultou na destruição da unidade de prisão e na morte de quatro rivais, entre eles

Ernaldo Pinto de Medeiros, o ""Uê"". Beira-Mar já foi condenado por esse crime. Marcinho VP ainda enfrentará um julgamento sobre o caso.

""Me arrumam processo em cima de processo. Consegue-se resolver dois, eles me arrumam mais três. Resolvi um, eles me arrumam mais dois. E nunca para. É uma forma de me perpetuar na cadeia"", afirma.

""O direito penal do inimigo é a antítese do Estado Democrático de Direito. Se a dignidade da pessoa humana é o eixo estrutural do Estado Democrático de Direito, no direito penal do inimigo, nós perdemos todos o status de cidadão e somos tratados como presos de guerra, como inimigos do Estado"", afirma.

Em texto para Marie Claire, colunista fala sobre suas experiências e conclui que a carência é a mãe da roubada

Clava Averbuck: Como descobrir se você está em um relacionamento abusivo (Foto: Jenna Jacobs on Unsplash)Nem sempre temos a consciência de que estamos em um relacionamento abusivo. Especialmente nós, mulheres que falam a respeito do tema e até ajudam outras mulheres a sair de roubadas do tipo, seja direta ou indiretamente, estamos sujeitas. Somos mulheres, afinal, como todas as outras. Bradar aos quatro ventos que nessa não caímos mais não nos impede de, achando que estamos andando no raso, um belo dia, pisar em um canal, ser sugada lá pra dentro e só se dar conta quando é tarde demais para sair. Quer dizer, nunca é demasiado tarde. Mas vai ficando mais difícil.O que é um relacionamento abusivo, afinal? Algumas mulheres acham que precisam chegar no extremo, que é a agressão física, para que vire abuso. Mas ei: existem várias formas de abuso. Nada brota de repente. Até chegar no físico, muitas outras etapas acontecem. Estou aqui hoje, eu, Clara, mulher independente e que, mesmo antes de ler sobre feminismo, já praticava e buscava liberdade e autonomia, pra dizer que também já entrei nessa roubada, uma, duas, três, quatro vezes.saiba mais#NegrasEmpreendedoras: Arquiteta brasileira criou aplicativo contra assédio de rua4 fatos sobre relacionamento abusivo que você precisa conhecerPorque existe um sistema de manipulação e nós caímos nele. E se eu chamo de sistema é porque é assim mesmo que percebo: um conjunto de regras. Se ele grita, se ele te diminui, se ele força sexo. Se ele te manipula através do sexo. Se ele te compara a outras, se ele fere sua autoestima, se ele usa seu dinheiro indiscriminadamente, ou, pior, faz com que você acredite que deve bancá-lo, afinal, estamos juntos, não é mesmo? Sim. Eu acredito nisso. Como não tenho renda fixa e geralmente me relaciono com homens que também não tem, acredito que em uma hora um vai ter, em outra, o outro vai ter, e assim as coisas vão se equilibrando. Mas se pesar demais para o seu lado, cuidado: pode ser abuso financeiro. Sim, isso existe e está inclusive previsto na Maria da Penha.Há algum tempo uma amiga me procurou em uma situação muito delicada. Ela tinha um negócio com o namorado e o abuso já estava num ponto em que ela acreditava que as pessoas não compravam o produto, e sim o invólucro dele, que foi o homem que fez. Era tudo dela, a criação, a comunicação, mas ele a fez acreditar que era por causa da... embalagem. Pode? Não pode, não. Mas acontece.Duvidar de tudo que você diz também é uma forma de abuso. Mexer nas suas redes? Abuso. Não, não fazemos apenas o que deixamos que façam com a gente. Não vivemos em uma bolha no vácuo, há todo um sistema que nos leva a tomar certas decisões e atitudes.E como sair disso, vocês me perguntam? Bom, não fiquei 8 anos solteira à toa. Depois do último, pensei: eu nunca mais posso cair nisso. Preciso ficar forte e entender os mecanismos. E a conclusão que eu cheguei, já há algum tempo, se resume a uma frase: a carência é a mãe da roubada.Somos ensinadas que não estamos completas sem um amor, sem a outra metade, a tal da tampa da panela, da metade da laranja. E muitas vezes acabamos aceitando o inaceitável em nome disso. Repito: mesmo as mulheres mais independentes, esclarecidas, com mil livros na cabeça e na cabeceira, carreira e contas bancárias sólidas, mesmo essas não estão livres disso. É uma questão estrutural. É algo que está muito entranhado em nossas construções.Não estou falando que todos os homens são monstros e nem que devemos fugir deles e viver solteiras para sempre. Amar é bom, relacionamentos podem ser saudáveis, ainda que complicados, mas temos que estar atentas a essa construção de amor romântico que nos anula. Na verdade, de onde vejo, acho que muitos deles são vítimas de uma construção de masculinidade tóxica que execra o feminino e é calcada em violência e dominação. Não sabem sequer nomear seus sentimentos e viram uns deficientes emocionais, que não sabem lidar com os sentimentos sem ser de formas violentas. Porém, mesmo eles sendo vítimas dessa masculinidade, quem paga o preço alto somos nós, mulheres.E é só conversando entre nós que isso pode mudar. Eles precisam conversar entre eles também. Nós com eles, se eles ouvirem, claro; eles entre eles; e, sobretudo, nós entre nós, unidas, se julgamentos e podendo não sentir vergonha das fragilidades que temos. Se não formos juntas, não vamos a lugar algum.

440,1,,".-Organizaciones sociales y políticas dominicanas condenaron enérgicamente las desarrolladas contra la migración haitiana en el país, como está ocurriendo actualmente en Pedernales donde personas desaprensivas están dando 24 horas a los haitianos residentes allí, luego que una pareja dominicana fuera presuntamente asesinada por haitianos, hecho que debió ser inmediatamente aclarado por las autoridades dominicanas, apresando a los culpables del crimen y sometiéndolos a la justicia para dispensarle el castigo que establecen las leyes.

Tal negligencia tampoco justifica acciones contra inocentes ni hechos reprochables de barbarismo contra la población migrante, los cuales presentan una muy mala imagen de la República Dominicana, nacional e internacionalmente.

Señalan, cómo los migrantes no llegan solos al país e identifican la existencia de redes de tráfico de personas “sin papeles” (haitianos y asiáticos) a través de la frontera con Haití, acciones promovidas por elites empresariales para aprovecharse de la mano de obra barata y desprovista de seguridad social, todo lo cual ocurre sin que el Gobierno Dominicano tome medidas efectivas para impedirlo.

“El hecho de que algún haitiano o de cualquier otra nacionalidad cometa actos criminales de violación a las leyes, no debe ser generalizado en contra de todos los migrantes, como es el caso que tratamos. Lo procedente es apresar las personas responsables de los crímenes, someter los violadores frente a las instancias de justicia, pues nunca puede justificarse la violencia ni poner en peligro las vidas y la convivencia de hombres, mujeres y niños migrantes que desarrollan sus actividades de manera pacífica y en el marco de las leyes”, indicaron.

Señalan las organizaciones dominicanas que no solo buena parte del pueblo haitiano es migrante, sino también casi el 20% de la población dominicana reside en el exterior desarrollan sus actividades laborales, contribuyendo con sus divisas al sostenimiento económico del país y de sus familias. Esa es la vida de los migrantes en cualquier país.

¿Por qué promover la confrontación y la discriminación de pobres contra pobres y entre pueblos migrantes? ¿Cuáles objetivos se buscan tras esta campaña y promoción?, son preguntas que se hacen las instituciones.

“Actualmente ha conmocionado a España el involucramiento de una dominicana en el asesinato de un hijo de su novio. ¿Qué diríamos si ahora se desarrollara en ese país y otros de Europa una campaña de odio contra toda la comunidad dominicana que nada tiene que ver con esos hechos? Rechazaríamos y denunciaríamos tales hipotéticos hechos. En igual situación rechazamos el acoso de que está siendo sometida la población haitiana en Pedernales, y en cualquier otro punto del país.”

Las organizaciones políticas y sociales, señalan que “el patriotismo dominicano no podrá jamás medirse por el odio a los haitianos, sino en trabajar para que podamos vivir libres, felices, independientes y tranquilos. Son los malos dominicanos quienes trabajan para lo contrario, no los haitianos. “

Las instituciones llaman a que la cuestión de la migración haitiana y sus descendientes en el país no siga siendo tomada como material de campaña y disputa política, pues se impone el absoluto respeto a los DDHH consignados en la Declaración Universal, en las convenciones y Pactos ratificados por el país. El Estado Dominicano debe reconocer las violaciones a los derechos ciudadanos producidos por la sentencia 168-13 y el genocidio jurídico que ha significado para cientos de miles de dominicanos de ascendencia haitiana, a quienes, sin justificación alguna, se les despojó de su nacionalidad dominicana.

Finalmente, las organizaciones llaman al pueblo a abstenerse de participar en acciones de confrontación con la población migrante, a exigir al Estado Dominicano políticas migratorias justas y asumir discursos coherentes que cierren el paso al terror contra los migrantes, garantizando que la justicia actúe diligentemente, la convivencia pacífica, un ambiente de seguridad y respeto a los derechos de las personas, evitando así que se repitan hechos bochornosos y reprochables como los de Pedernales.

Nota da defesa de Lula – A defesa do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva apresentou hoje (16/03) nos autos da Apelação Criminal nº 5046512-94.2016.4.04.7000/PR, que tramita perante o Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª. Região (TRF4), novas provas que confirmam a nulidade do processo relativo ao “tríplex” e a inocência de Lula. O pedido de juntada desses novos documentos tem fundamento no artigo 231 do Código de Processo Penal.

A primeira prova nova apresentada diz respeito aos vídeos e declarações que demonstram a insólita participação de autoridades norte-americanas na “construção do caso” Lava Jato e no encaminhamento do processo relativo ao apartamento tríplex. Em manifestações públicas que agora chegaram ao conhecimento da defesa, o Sr. Kenneth Blanco, então Vice-Procurador Geral Adjunto do Departamento de Justiça dos Estados Unidos (DOJ), e o Sr. Trevor Mc Fadden, então Subsecretário Geral de Justiça Adjunto Interino daquele País, explanaram sobre cooperação baseada em “confiança” (aos 8m8s do vídeo1) e por vezes fora dos “procedimentos oficiais”, realizada entre as autoridades norte-americanas e os Procuradores da República da Lava Jato (“Tal confiança, como alguns aqui dizem “confiança”, permite que promotores e agentes tenham comunicação direta quanto às provas. Dado o relacionamento íntimo entre o Departamento de Justiça e os promotores brasileiros, não dependemos apenas de procedimentos oficiais como tratados de assistência jurídica mútua, que geralmente levam tempo e recursos consideráveis para serem escritos, traduzidos, transmitidos oficialmente e respondidos” ( sic)). Blanco fez referência específica em seu pronunciamento à sentença condenatória proferida contra Lula e ressaltou também neste caso a parceria norte-americana com os membros do MPF (aos 9m47s do vídeo1).

Essa cooperação sem qualquer registro e realizada fora dos canais oficiais se mostra incompatível com o Decreto nº 3.810/2001, que incorporou ao ordenamento jurídico brasileiro o “Acordo de Assistência Judiciária em Matéria Penal entre o Governo da República Federativa do Brasil e o Governo dos Estados Unidos da América, celebrado em Brasília em 14 de outubro de 1997”. Segundo esse diploma, toda solicitação de assistência em matéria penal dirigida aos Estados Unidos deve ser feita por meio da Autoridade Central, que no Brasil é o Ministério da Justiça. No processo, todavia, e ao que se tenha conhecimento, inexiste qualquer registro da participação do Ministério da Justiça na cooperação confessada pelos agentes norte-americanos.

Diante dessa nova prova, a defesa pediu que o Ministério Público Federal seja notificado a esclarecer essa inusitada forma de cooperação sem a observância dos “procedimentos oficiais” e baseada na “confiança” especificamente sobre o caso de Lula.

Outra prova nova apresentada foi o depoimento prestado ao juízo da 13ª. Vara Federal Criminal de Curitiba em 23/02/2018 pelo Sr. Márcio Faria, ex-executivo da Odebrecht, nos autos da Ação Penal nº 5021365-32.2017.4.04.7000/PR. Faria afirmou que a OAS não efetuou o pagamento de vantagem indevida ao Partido dos Trabalhadores em relação a contratos firmados entre a Petrobras e o Consórcio Rnest/Conest. Esse depoimento, coletado sob o compromisso da verdade, confirma a declaração de João Vaccari Neto, já levada aos autos, no sentido de não realizou qualquer pacto de corrupção com Leo Pinheiro em nome de Lula que envolvesse valores a serem descontados de reformas realizadas no apartamento tríplex.

As novas provas apresentadas reclamam a necessidade de o TRF4, ao julgar os embargos de declaração, proclamar a nulidade de todo o processo ou, então, absolver o ex-presidente Lula.

A mudança começou em 2017 para boletos com valores iguais ou superiores a 50.000 reais. Gradualmente, os valores foram baixando para aumentar a quantidade de pessoas beneficiadas, além da adaptação feita pelo credor, que precisa substituir o modelo de cobrança.

Cerca de 20 mil votos – quase metade dos 46 mil votos que elegeram a socióloga, saíram dos bairros nobres da Zona Sul carioca e na Barra da Tijuca, Zona Oeste.

Enquanto na Rocinha ela teve apenas 22 votos, no Leblon foram 1027. Marielle colheu mais 1.900 votos em Laranjeiras e outros 2.742 votos em Copacabana.

Na também famosa Cidade de Deus, foram apenas 89 votos. Já na Freguesia, área de classe média alta de Jacarepaguá, a política do PSOL foi a escolha de 707 eleitores.

Na Grande Tijuca, área nobre da Zona Norte, Marielle teve um ótimo desempenho: 6.500 votos.

É impressionante verificar que no complexo da Maré, suposta base eleitoral da vereadora, foram apenas 50 votos.

Se incluirmos Ramos e Bonsucesso, esse número sobe para 2.196 votos – resultado distante do obtido entre o eleitorado de melhor poder aquisitivo.

449,3,1.0,"Olá, eu sou o Caio Ferreira, criador do incrível treinamento Negócio em 21 Dias onde ensino tudo sobre como criar uma loja virtual do zero, sem investir nenhum centavo em estoques utilizando a metodologia Grátis + FRETE para desbancar a concorrência das grandes lojas e fazer muitas vendas todos os dias!

Eu vou te ensinar exatamente o que faço nas minhas lojas virtuais para que você possa copiar e criar o seu negócio na internet.

No momento praticamente não existem lojas virtuais oferecendo produtos grátis + FRETE e por isso AGORA é o melhor momento para você começar a sua! Aproveite que não existe concorrência e o mercado está mais fácil para criar um negócio sólido e depois não precisar se preocupar com os concorrentes que vão aparecer!

Eu trabalho na internet desde 2008 e já tentei diversas formas para trabalhar em casa e ter um negócio online. Recentemente eu descobri essa fantástica técnica e agora decidi ensinar para você.

Algumas pessoas me perguntam porque eu ensino meu método ao invés de guardar segredo já que ele me dá tanto dinheiro. E a resposta é que o mercado é muito grande e esta totalmente inexplorado e nem se eu trabalhasse todas as horas do meu dia eu iria conseguir aproveitar todas as oportunidades que existem.

Por isso eu decidi fazer este treinamento

Você cria uma loja virtual com apenas alguns cliques. Depois você cadastra diversos produtos na sua loja virtual com preço de R$0,00, mas o cliente precisa pagar o valor do frete para receber o produto em casa. . Não é necessário investir em estoque porque você anuncia os produtos que estão no estoque do seu fornecedor. Você recebe o valor que o cliente pagou de frete para receber o produto em casa. O valor do frete cobrado é maior do que o seu custo para pagar o envio do produto e ainda suficiente para pagar o preço do produto e ainda lucrar!

As aulas do treinamento são dividas em 21 dias, mas quando você acessar a área de alunos você terá acesso a todas as aulas e poderá assistir as aulas da forma que você peferir e no tempo que você achar melhor. Cada dia dos 21 dias tem uma aula que ensina como fazer um determinado passo e depois de assistir a aula você precisa fazer uma atividade.

Você vai ter um endereço do tipo www.sualoja.com para sua loja virtual porque ter o endereço desse tipo passa confiança e credibilidade para seus clientes. Você vai aprender como fazer toda a configuração da sua loja, como pegar as informações dos produtos no site do fornecedor e a cadastrar todos os produtos na sua loja em apenas alguns minutos. Você vai ter um nome e um logotipo profissional para sua loja em apenas alguns minutos. Vou já vai saber em qual nicho você vai trabalhar e vai aprender a escolher os produtos que você vai vender na sua loja. Vou te contar quem são os meus principais fornecedores e vou te mostrar como você pode encontrar novos fornecedores. Eu vou te revelar os top fornecedores que eu descobri com toda minha experiência e que eu uso no dia a dia do meu negócio! E vou te ensinar também como encontrar os melhores fornecedores para sua loja! É muito importante trabalhar com bons fornecedores para que você consiga os produtos com um preço bem baixo e de qualidade.

Não existe ninguém falando sobre como fazer uma loja virtual com o método G+F no Brasil. Não existem vídeos no Youtube, não existem artigos em blogs no Google e nenhuma outra forma de você aprender o que eu vou ensinar para você.Pense bem em uma situação onde uma pessoa que passou um ano inteiro estudando para uma prova de concurso e chega na hora da prova ela percebe que esqueceu o seu estojo com lápis, borracha e caneta. Neste momento uma simples caneta passa a ser um produto irresistível. Essa pessoa precisa tanto de uma caneta para fazer a prova que ela estaria disposta a pagar 10, 20, 30 ou até 50 reais por uma caneta que normalmente não custa nem 1 real! Este é só um exemplo, você não precisa vender canetas na sua loja, mas como uma caneta na hora de uma prova é um produto irresistível existem diversos outros produtos que se oferecidos para as pessoas certas no momento certo são quase impossíveis de não serem comprados!

A segunda garantia é uma garantia válida somente para quem aplicar o método a risca, e seguir todos os passos que eu ensino no curso. Se você fizer tudo o que ensino e não começar a fazer vendas em até 21 dias após sua inscrição no curso  (sem incluir encargos financeiros - veja condições aqui ).

""Ao contrário do que Pedro Parente afirmou, o prejuízo de R$ 446 milhões que a companhia registrou não teve como principal causa despesas extraordinárias efetuadas nos últimos meses do ano, como o pagamento de R$ 11,198 bilhões aos acionistas norte-americanos beneficiados pelo questionável 'acordo' que atendeu, principalmente, aos interesses dos fundos abutres""

247 - A Federação Única dos Petroleiros (FUP) afirmou que os resultados da Petrobras em 2017, anunciados nesta quinta-feira, 15, comprovam que a empresa ""está retrocedendo a passos largos e comprometendo cada vez mais o seu futuro"". ""Ao contrário do que Pedro Parente afirmou, o prejuízo de R$ 446 milhões que a companhia registrou não teve como principal causa despesas extraordinárias efetuadas nos últimos meses do ano, como o pagamento de R$ 11,198 bilhões aos acionistas norte-americanos beneficiados pelo questionável 'acordo' que atendeu, principalmente, aos interesses dos fundos abutres"".

""O balanço reflete os problemas de gestão da Petrobrás"", afirmou o economista Eduardo Pinto, um dos pesquisadores do Instituto de Estudos Estratégicos de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis Zé Eduardo Dutra (INEEP), durante Análise Crítica dos resultados da empresa, realizada nesta quinta, em parceria com a Carta Capital, e transmitida ao vivo pela Web TV da revista e pelo Facebook da FUP.

De acordo com a federação, ""o desmonte do parque de refino e as privatizações estão fazendo a Petrobrás perder mercado, o que reflete diretamente na sua capacidade de gerar receitas, alertaram os economistas"". ""Os números da empresa falam por si só. O lucro operacional do refino despencou 42% em 2017. A produção de derivados caiu 5% e as vendas despencaram 6%, apesar do país ter registrado aumento de 1% no consumo de derivados. A geração de caixa no refino, no transporte e na comercialização de derivados caiu R$ 18,9 bilhões. Ou seja, enquanto a gestão Pedro Parente desmonta o setor de refino e a logística da empresa, as importadoras de derivados fazem a festa"".

Segundo o economista Rodrigo Leão, coordenador do INEEP, ""em curto e médio prazo, a Petrobrás caminha para se tornar uma empresa que só produz no pré-sal e que só exporta petróleo, abrindo mão de outros segmentos, na direção inversa das grandes empresas do setor"".

Em 2017, a Petrobras aumentou em 23% a exportação de óleo cru, mas os resultados da empresa apontam que, apesar do aumento de mais de 15% dos preços internacionais do barril de petróleo, as exportações não compensaram as perdas amargadas com o refino e a quebra da integração da companhia. ""Exportamos petróleo cru e aumentamos as importações de derivados. A gestão Pedro Parente está tornando o país dependente do mercado internacional"", criticou Rodrigo.

Outro indicador ressaltado pelos pesquisadores do INEEP foi a estagnação da produção de petróleo, mesmo com o aumento da produtividade do pré-sal. Entre 2016 e 2017, a Petrobrás registrou queda de 1% na produção de petróleo e gás natural, principalmente em função da venda de ativos e da redução de investimentos em campos maduros. Na Bacia de Campos, por exemplo, houve uma redução de 14% na produção, que caiu de 1,66 milhões de barris diários de petróleo para 1,43 milhões de barris.

""A Petrobrás está sendo gerida como uma empresa que não pensa em longo prazo e isso é um suicídio para as empresas de petróleo"", criticou o coordenador da FUP, José Maria Rangel, ressaltando que, com a abertura da exploração do pré-sal, a estatal brasileira corre o risco também de perder o protagonismo na exploração e produção de petróleo.

""O Brasil caminha a passos largos para voltar a ser um ator secundário no setor de óleo e gás. Se não estancarmos essa sangria, o país vai passar por um processo de desindustrialização profundo"", alertou José Maria lembrando que a Petrobrás já chegou a responder por 13% do PIB nacional e teve a capacidade de desenvolver todas as regiões do país, gerando empregos e renda no Brasil e não no exterior, como está acontecendo agora.

Nas ruas, país mostrou que não quer andar para trás

16 de Março de 2018

Inscreva-se na TV247

Ao reunir milhares de pessoas  nos protestos em defesa da memória de uma mulher, negra, favelada (e ilustre desconhecida fora do Rio de Janeiro) a reação ao assassinato de Marielle Franco  mostra que brasileiras e brasileiros retornam ao terreno prioritário da luta popular, que é a mobilização em espaços públicos por direitos e reivindicações.

Ao lado da respeitável mobilização de professoras da rede municipal de São Paulo, indignadas com uma ataque traiçoeiro de João Dória a seu sistema de previdência, ilustrado por uma sangrenta repressão policial a uma manifestação da véspera, este é o grande significado da jornada de ontem, quando ocorreram mobilizações cuja grandeza não se via desde a greve geral em defesa dos direitos trabalhistas.

Separadas por motivações de química  diversa, mas unidas pelo mesmo sentido geral de resistência diante de iniciativas levadas a cabo por Temer & Cia, os protestos mostram que a população não aguenta mais viver sob um  estado de coisas intolerável e se dispõe a ir as ruas para defender seus direitos.

A biografia de Marielle é, em si, a grande síntese do que está em jogo, num  processo monstruoso pelo qual tenta-se destruir conquistas recentes e fazer a  história andar para trás.

Em 2002, ela era uma favelada que ingressava na PUC do Rio de Janeiro para fazer um curso universitário. Dezesseis anos mais tarde, formada e pós-graduada, quinta vereadora mais votada no Rio de Janeiro, liderança  popular ativa e respeitada, foi executada à bala quando voltava para casa após debater a intervenção federal num encontro no Acari, região especialmente conhecida como área de violência policial. (Em média, 25% das 2125 mortes violentas ocorridas na cidade do Rio de Janeiro em 2017 foram produzidas pela PM.  Já é um índice altíssimo mas na região do Acari, alvo de denúncias frequentes e corajosas da vereadora, esse índice é ainda maior, chegando a 32% em 2017).

Num governo marcado por falsas retomadas e planos de curta duração, numa sequência recorde de ações de marketing, a intervenção militar chegou a ser apresentada pelos ""profissionais"" da escola Moreira Franco como primeira fase de um projeto reeleitoral do mais impopular presidente de nossa história republicana.

O  assassinato marca o apodrecimento precoce de mais recente iniciativa de baixa política, incapaz de gerar qualquer benefício aproveitável do ponto de vista da segurança pública -- e que a partir de agora terá como prioridade moral e política a obrigação de esclarecer um crime localizado em suas próprias entranhas.

Se imaginava que iria andar para a frente, Temer & Cia voltaram a andar para trás -- mas o país deixou claro que não quer ir junto.

O prometido rigor no combate a corrupção policial e a presença do tráfico nas favelas, quando se chegou a exigir o compromisso de não investigar denúncias envolvendo crimes contra direitos humanos, num eufemismo tácito para liberar a tortura, exibiu sua face real, previsível e didática num ataque covarde contra uma mulher, negra, favelada.

Marielle, um crime de verdade para o general Braga investigar

""Um mês depois da intervenção militar no Rio de Janeiro, a execução da vereadora Meirelle Franco coloca um caso sério nas mãos do general Braga Neto"", explica Paulo Moreira Leite, articulista do 247; ""Em vez de  abrir mochilas de crianças e fotografar moradores de favela para identificação criminal, é hora investigar um assassinato que tem implicações políticas claras, pois a vítima tinha uma honrada militância em defesa dos direitos humanos e da população pobre""; lembrando a situação do México, onde as Forças Armadas assumiram a tarefa de zelar pela segurança interna há uma década, PML recorda que as execuções e desaparecimentos cresceram mais de 100% apenas no primeiro ano - e seguem em escalada a cada ano

Ação do Exército no Rio copia receita de tragédia mexicana

Em visita ao Brasil, o professor aposentado Luiz Vásquez, da Universidade Autônoma do México, traça um paralelo entre os dois países e diz em entrevista a Paulo Moreira Leite, do 247, que ""após o golpe, e uma política econômica de subordinação aos interesses norte-americanos, o Brasil segue o caminho que produziu a tragédia instalada há duas décadas em meu país""; PML lembra que a militarização da Segurança Pública, no México, ""já deixou um saldo de 32.277 desaparecidos em uma década e meia e veio acompanhada de uma política de subordinação geral aos Estados Unidos, que começou em 1994 com um acordo de livre comércio e terminou pelo rebaixamento das Forças Armadas ao papel de polícia""

TSE confirma reverência da Justiça diante da mídia

""Ao revogar em apenas 72 horas uma decisão que lhe permitia censurar pesquisas eleitorais, o TSE dá uma demonstração definitiva da reverência do Judiciário perante a opinião dos grupos que dominam a comunicação social no país"", escreve Paulo Moreira Leite, articulista do 247. Para PML, ""não há dúvida de que a resolução abolida era incompatível, num plano até grosseiro, com uma Constituição que proíbe a censura prévia. Mas o recuo em alta velocidade confirma que vivemos uma situação vergonhosa e preocupante, mostrando que os grandes oligopólios de mídia não têm a menor dificuldade para defender interesses e impor opiniões ao conjunto da sociedade, utilizando a Justiça para isso""

Cármen Lúcia e a memória do AI-5: “às favas todos os escrúpulos de consciência”

""Ao tentar impedir de todas as maneiras o debate em plenário do STF sobre um pedido de habeas corpus para Lula, a presidente Cármen Lúcia se alinha à mais lamentável tradição autoritária brasileira"", escreve Paulo Moreira Leite, articulista do 247; lembrando a reunião do Conselho de Segurança Nacional que aprovou o AI-5, em 1968, PML recorda a frase do então ministro Jarbas Passarinho para perguntar se a presidente da mais alta corte do justiça do país também deseja passar para a história mandando ""às favas todos os escrúpulos de consciência""

Após 5 a 0, STF pode definir grau de barbaridade em que o país se encontra

""Resultado da votação do STJ sobre habeas corpus para Lula era mais do que previsível"", escreve Paulo Moreira Leite, articulista do 247, que há uma semana escreveu que a chance de um resultado favorável era ""nula"". O jornalista lembra que, ""se tudo continuar como está, o roteiro conduz Lula para a cadeia"". PML destaca ainda que ""vários ministros do Supremo deixaram claro que não querem fazer o papel de bibelôs num caso dessa envergadura""

Cientistas da Academia Russa de Ciências e da Universidade Estadual de Moscou desenvolveram um software livre para calcular a permeabilidade de modelos 3D de formações geológicas. O programa permite uma melhoria significativa na eficiência da exploração de depósitos de hidrocarbonetos.

Muitos países produtores de petróleo em todo o mundo possuem grandes depósitos de recursos de hidrocarbonetos não mais acessíveis devido à exploração ineficiente. Por regra, quanto mais um campo de petróleo é explorado, mais difícil se torna explorar hidrocarbonetos. Este problema é exacerbado quando as empresas não tentam calcular a dinâmica em mudança dentro desses poços.

Agora, físicos e geólogos do Instituto de Geosfera Dinâmica, do Instituto de Física da Terra, da Universidade Estadual de Moscou e seus parceiros de pesquisa da Arábia Saudita e da Austrália desenvolveram um novo programa baseado em um algoritmo testado para melhorar a eficiência de extração calculando a dinâmica de mudanças ao longo do tempo e tendo em conta suas propriedades físicas flutuantes durante o uso.

O programa aproveita uma ideia matemática desenvolvida por cientistas soviéticos na década de 1950 através de uma variação no chamado ""método de diferenças finitas"". O algoritmo do programa quebra o modelo unidades chamadas voxels, que têm suas próprias propriedades físicas e afetam o fluxo de óleo e outros líquido. O modelo permite uma simplificação dramática dos cálculos.

Os físicos testaram seu algoritmo usando amostras de rochas contendo óleo extraídos de um reservatório próximo da cidade siberiana de Tyumen. Os testes mostraram que o algoritmo tem precisão equivalente a programas tradicionais que requerem poder de computação maciço. Porém, ao contrário de softwares de modelagem tradicional, que exige recursos computacionais somente disponíveis em supercomputadores, o software dos físicos russos pode ser executado em um computador comum ou mesmo em um laptop.

De acordo com os cientistas, seu programa certamente se tornará útil não só para o setor de petróleo, mas também para engenheiros geológicos, hidrogeólogos, cientistas do solo e outros especialistas cujo trabalho requer cálculos associados à permeabilidade de ambientes porosos.

O programa foi disponibilizado gratuitamente para qualquer pessoa que esteja interessada. Uma descrição geral do algoritmo e seus princípios serão publicados na edição de maio da revista científica Computers & Science.

Os submarinos nucleares russos conduziram um exercício perto das bases militares norte-americanas com o objetivo de evitar a detecção quando chegaram perto da costa dos Estados Unidos, disse um comandante do esquadrão submarino a um canal de TV militar russo.

A deslumbrante revelação foi feita em uma série de TV militar lançada no Zvezda ('Estrela'), o organismo de transmissão do Ministério da Defesa russo. O episódio se concentra em submarinos de ataque nucleares de classe Akula, os Shchuka-B.

De acordo com um oficial de submarino entrevistado pelo canal, o comando da Marinha russa ordenou que se posicionasse na proximidade das bases militares dos EUA durante os exercícios.

""Esta missão foi realizada, os submarinos apareceram no local definido no oceano e voltaram para a base"", disse ao Zvezda o comandante do esquadrão submarino, Sergei Starshinov.

Perguntado se os submarinos conseguiram ficar longe do radar durante a missão, Starshinov respondeu afirmativamente.

""Sim. Este é o nosso objetivo — ir e vir sem ser detectado"", revelou.

O comandante da Marinha disse que as embarcações russas chegaram ""suficientemente perto"" das margens americanas, mas não violaram as fronteiras marítimas dos EUA, permanecendo em águas neutras.

A data e a localização da missão secreta não foram divulgadas, mas o canal disse que os submarinos nucleares russos ""chegaram ao litoral dos EUA"".

O submarino Shchuka-B foi encomendado para a Marinha Soviética em 1986. O submarino de energia nuclear é capaz de lançar mísseis de cruzeiro Kalibr ou Granat, envolvendo alvos subaquáticos com seus torpedos de 553mm e podendo ficar submersos por até 100 dias, de acordo com fontes abertas.

Tal como acontece com muitos submarinos nucleares russos, as informações de seu status, bem como as atualizações atuais e passadas, são escassas. Entende-se que vários submarinos desta classe estão sendo operados pela Marinha russa ou estão passando por modernização. Um submarino Shchuka-B foi arrendado para a Índia, onde entrou no serviço sob o nome INS Chakra. Confira primeiro VÍDEO do interior do submarino russo K-335 Gepard

Em 2016, um alto funcionário da Marinha dos EUA queixou-se de que os militares não podem garantir a plena consciência das atualizações de submarinos russos que estavam no nível não visto desde a Guerra Fria.

""Os submarinos que estamos vendo são muito mais sigilosos"", disse à CNN o almirante Mark Ferguson, comandante das Forças Navais dos EUA na Europa na época. Os russos ""têm sistemas de armas mais avançados, sistemas de mísseis que podem atacar a terra em longas distâncias"", e suas capacidades operacionais estavam melhorando ""à medida que vão mais longe das águas locais"".

Ricardo é um duro crítico dos direitos humanos. Mas não sabia ao certo do que falava. Quando descobriu que os comentários que faz na internet só existem porque vivemos em uma sociedade em que, teoricamente, se respeitam os direitos humanos, ele tomou um susto.

Ricardo agora pensa em se lançar candidato a deputado nas próximas eleições. “Vou usar meu direito de me expressar contra os direitos humanos no palanque.

460,1,,"South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster (R) is disgusted that thousands of students are protesting gun violence around the nation and described kids walking out of classrooms as “shameful.”

McMaster made his comments on the state’s public television network ETV on Wednesday and speculated that the students were merely “being used as a tool by a left-wing group to further their own agenda,” even though he offered no evidence of that claim.

“It sounds like a protest to me. It’s not a memorial, it’s certainly not a prayer service, it’s a political statement by a left-wing group and it’s shameful,” McMaster said.

McMaster then suggested that students pray instead of protesting as if God would solve all their problems, not legislation from Congress, or new gun control laws.

Watch some of his comments below:

Contrary to the governor’s comments, the nationwide walkout was actually organized by student survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that killed 17 of their own.

One of those students, David Hogg, who has appeared in the media numerous times since that fateful day, responded to the governor:

“Those future voters will not reelect you and outlive you too,” Hogg tweeted. He then added: “can’t wait to see what the history books our generation writes will have to say about people like you.”

Regardless of this one governor’s comments, the message thousands of students sent was “Enough is enough.” This is the new generation. They may not be able to vote yet, but they will one day. And, you better believe that they’re not betting on prayer to solve the issue surrounding guns.

465,1,,"A Prefeitura de São Paulo anunciou que irá reestruturar o sistema de saúde na cidade. A principal mudança será o fechamento de 108 Assistências Médicas Ambulatoriais (AMAs), que serão absorvidas pelas Unidades Básicas de Saúde (UBSs). A diferença entre os dois tipos de estabelecimentos é que as AMAs são unidades de pronto atendimento para casos de baixa complexidade, enquanto as UBSs são centros médicos com consultas agendadas.

De acordo com o secretário de Saúde da atual gestão, Wilson Pollara, 108 AMAs se transformarão em 63 UBSs, 19 Unidades de Pronto Atendimento (UPAs) e 26 em ambulatórios de especialidades. “O atendimento será exatamente igual, mas a pessoa não será atendida por um plantonista que irá vê-la de vez em quando e sim pelo médico de família dela”, diz. “Se a pessoa precisar de um atendimento de emergência ela poderá ir na AMA de 24 horas que se transformará em uma UPA.”

Pacientes denunciam falta de médicos em UBS da zona leste

O anúncio vem gerando manifestação de parte da população que teme a superlotação das UBSs e dos prontos socorros de hospitais. “A melhora do sistema de saúde precisa ser discutida. Mas a mudança não pode ser realizada da noite para o dia porque já se gerou uma demanda pelo serviço existente”, afirma Marília Louvison, professora da Faculdade de Saúde Pública da Universidade de São Paulo (USP), especialista em regulação do Sistema Único de Saúde.

Para Marília, as Unidades Básicas de Saúde foram criadas, inicialmente, para realizar atendimentos emergenciais e também agendados. Com o aumento da demanda, as gestões optaram por transferir o pronto atendimento às AMAs. “Para que tudo seja incorporado pelas UBSs, é preciso que seja realizada uma análise de demanda”, diz ela. “Também não se pode esperar que profissionais habilitados para atender em AMAs sejam simplesmente aproveitados em unidades básicas.”

“A população se queixava que as UBSs só atendiam com hora marcada e não tinham procedimentos simples”, diz Pollara. Para atender esse tipo de necessidade, foram criadas as AMAs. Com a atual mudança, diz o secretário, o médico da família realizará esse tipo de consulta.

UBS na zona sul de São Paulo é interditada pela Defesa Civil

Incorporar demandas instantâneas às Unidades Básicas de Saúde, sem que elas estejam preparadas para dar respostas emergenciais à população, explica Marília, pode criar um risco de desassistência. “Seria mais prudente fazer um experimento local, em alguns territórios de forma piloto.”

A ideia da reestruturação é que as famílias passem a ser atendidas por médicos generalistas. Esses profissionais, por sua vez, deverão os pacientes e encaminhá-los para especialistas.

Segundo o secretário de saúde, as AMAs são superlotados porque não se consegue dimensionar quem busca esse tipo de atendimento. “Tem horas que o espaço fica lotado porque muita gente vai no mesmo horário”, afirma. “O médico da família atende entre 3,5 mil a 4 mil pessoas. Ele tem condições de atender essa população de forma mais adequada.”

Hoje, um médico das AMAs realiza oito consultas por hora. Na UBS, segundo o Pollara, o profissional realizaria entre três e quatro atendimentos. “Não existe organização, o atendimento é falho. Não há o mínimo direcionamento”, diz o secretário. Exemplo citado pelo secretário é o caso de um pediatra que será transferido por ter a agenda subutilizada. ""Ele possui apenas 40% da agenda ocupada com casos de pesagens e medida de crianças. É um trabalho que pode ser feito pelo médico de família.”

A previsão da Secretaria da Saúde para evitar a superlotaçãi é de que, até a metade do ano, sejam contratados 250 médicos para o programa “Médico da Família” e mais 200 até o final do ano. A orientação é que as Unidades de Pronto Atendimento (UPAs) sejam procuradas quando as UBSs estiverem fechadas ou quando a urgência for de média complexidade.

Para Marília, da USP, há hoje uma cultura  no País onde se criou uma demanda e uma necessidade pelo atendimento emergencial. “Por isso, as mudanças terão de ser muito bem preparadas.” De acordo com o secretário, apenas duas AMAs passaram pela mudança, a do Jardim Tietê e Vila Carmosina, zona leste de São Paulo.

467,1,,"Seven years on in Syria: Nobody seems willing to stop the bloodshed              A Syrian child navigates the rubble of the rebel-held town of Duma in east Ghouta on March 8, 2018. (Hamza al Ajweh / AFP/Getty Images)            Slightly more than four years ago, Stephen Hawking, the famed physicist who died Wednesday, described what was happening in Syria as ""an abomination, one that the world is watching coldly from a distance.""     It was finally time, he wrote, to say ""no more.""        Yet more is what has come to Syria, which has become an emblem of man-made misery in a conflict that marked its seventh anniversary Thursday.      The crisis, which began as part of the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings, disintegrated into a hellish civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands. The United Nations gave up tracking the numbers years ago, though some war monitors say roughly 500,000 people have been killed.        Hundreds of thousands more have been wounded, and more than half the country's prewar population of 22 million has been displaced, igniting a refugee crisis that has hardened anti-immigrant sentiments across Europe. Some of the country's most historic cities and sites have been pummeled into wastelands of jagged masonry and rusted rebar — the detritus of lives destroyed in campaigns where siege tactics and indiscriminate attacks have become the norm.      In ways, the conflict has redefined what is permissible in wartime.     It has also become an internecine proxy war that has reshaped alliances and helped reopen the doors to the Cold War era. And it has come at the expense of the people all sides claim to want to protect.     ""The Syrian conflict has shown the moral bankruptcy and cowardice of the international community. It has exposed the incompetence of the Security Council and the U. N.,"" said Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics, in a phone interview Wednesday.           Syrian government forces deploy in the captured town of Beit Sawa in the east Ghouta region. (AFP/Getty Images)         ""Syria now has become a battleground for regional and global powers, who are basically trying to grab as much territory as possible in order to maximize their interest,"" he said.      Of the latest wave of cease-fires, one, Resolution 2401, was unanimously voted into place by the United Nations Security Council in February. A few days later, it was followed by a daily truce ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, the top ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad.     They were broken almost before they began.     In Afrin, a Kurdish-dominated enclave in the country's northwest, Turkish troops working alongside Syrian rebels all but ignored the cease-fire and pressed their campaign (euphemistically called Operation Olive Branch) to dislodge the U.S.-allied militias that Ankara views as a proxy for a Kurdish separatist movement in its own territory. More than 200 people have been killed, according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitor based in Britain.     In east Ghouta, a network of suburbs near Damascus and home to an estimated 350,000 people, the weeks-long assault on the rebels there continued unabated despite widespread condemnation by world powers.     The rebel-held enclave has endured the full gamut of the war's horrors. In 2013, it was the site of a deadly sarin gas attack that killed hundreds and the target of a years-long government siege.     But that has been eclipsed by the no-holds barred assault this year that has forced residents to seek shelter underground, where they pack by the hundreds in basements to escape the rain of mortar shells, artillery and bombs. The number of dead surpassed 1,000 people this week, as loyalist troops clawed back chunks of rebel-held areas and uprooted thousands.     Elsewhere in the country, the armies of three countries — the U.S., Russia and Turkey — and the special forces of a few more share a battleground with hundreds of rebel and militant factions fighting pro-government, Iranian-backed militias.        In between them stands the U.N., ""which has been taken hostage"" as it scrambles to balance the interests of member nations, said Lakhdar Brahimi, a veteran diplomat and former special envoy to Syria.      ""During the Cold War, the U.N. was paralyzed because of the disagreements between the major powers,"" Brahimi said Wednesday. ""As far as I'm concerned we're back with the conditions of the Cold War, and the U.N. finds it more and more difficult to act.""     Even when aid is delivered, the U.N. as well as other aid groups are criticized for favoring one side over another, said Ali Zaatari, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for the country.     ""We have a problem in that all parties want us, as humanitarians working in Syria, to absorb and accept their view of the conflict in a bid to draw legitimacy.""     And the fighting has raged on, said Joshua Landis, director of the University of Oklahoma's Center for Middle East Studies, in full view of the world.     ""Syria has engaged a great deal of the world's attention in the last seven years,"" Landis said. ""The problem is that no one really cares about Syria the country, it's that they care about the geographic position of Syria and they want leverage.     ""They care about Syria, but not the Syrian people.""     For many Syrians, the different sides fade into irrelevance when stacked against the horrific toll of the war.        Displaced children from the Kurdish-majority city of Afrin in northern Syria, which is nearly surrounded by Turkish-led forces (Nazeer al Khatib / AFP/Getty Images)        ""We believe that the Ghouta is precious for you,"" Ward Mardini, a pro-opposition activist in the area, wrote to the rebel commanders in Ghouta on her Facebook page. ""But we're tired and the situation demands a realistic solution that stanches the waterfall of blood.""     Yet no side seems willing to stop.     Through its Kurdish allies, the U.S. controls about 30% of Syria, which it views as a necessary buffer against an Iranian-led power crescent stretching from Tehran to Beirut. Assad's government, which has shown no interest in negotiations, still vows to reclaim all of Syria.     The biggest winners are perhaps Iran and Russia; their support for Damascus, credited for having kept Assad in power and turning the tide of the war in his favor, means they will lead the charge in a reconstruction bonanza that will require an estimated $250 billion. Iranian and Russian firms have already netted electricity, gas and oil contracts.     But even that has become another battlefield; part of a strategy, Landis said, where ""no one is allowed to win.""     ""That has been the guiding thread over the last seven years,"" he said.     ""No one has cared enough to win, but nobody wants to lose.""                    A digest of essential news, insight and analysis from L.A. Times editors.       You are now following this newsletter.

O temporal alagou ruas em diversos bairros, derrubou muros e árvores e bloqueou ruas ao longo da tarde. No Alto da XV, carros foram cobertos pela água.

Na BR-277, a concessionária Ecovia divulgou alerta quando chovia forte em vários trechos. Boletim da Setran das 15h20 mostrava trânsito complicado na Rua Visconde de Nácar com as ruas Fernando Moreira e Cruz Machado, e na Alameda Dr. Carlos de Carvalho com a Rua Visconde de Nácar, com pontos de alagamento.

Outro ponto de alagamento, segundo a Prefeitura, foi registrado pela Defesa Civil de Curitiba no bairro Campo Comprido, na Rua Dr. José Cláudio Ribeiro Renno. Também há relatos de alagamentos no Abranches e na região do Bosque Alemão. Também um trecho da Rua Mateus Leme, próximo ao Shopping Mueller ficou alagada. Nas redes sociais internautas postaram fotos de ruas algadas também nos bairros Boa Vista e Bom Retiro.

No Cabral, uma árvore caiu e bloqueou o trânsito na Rua Manoel Pedro, próximo ao Terminal Cabral. Semáforos em alerta na Av. Pres. Getúlio Vargas e na Av. Iguaçu, nos cruzamentos com a Av. Pres. Arthur Bernardes, no Santa Quitéria.

Bloqueio total foi registrado na Rua Iapó com a Rua Guabirotuba, por causa da chuva. Agentes da Setran orientam o trânsito. A chuva forte também chegou a bloquear a Rua Engenheiros Rebouças com a Rua Des. Westphalen. O trecho foi liberado dpeois das 16 horas.

Desde a manhã, chove no Sul-Leste do Paraná. Algumas localidades já tem um volume elevado de chuva, são alguns exemplos (até o começpo da tarde): Palmas 36,4 mm, Inácio Martins 48,4 mm, Praia de Leste 40 mm, Rio Negro 33,2 e Lapa 41,8 mm.

Em Curitiba, segundo o Simepar, foram mais de 57 milímetros de chuva nesta quarta-feira, sendo 44 mm só em uma hora. A média histórica de março é de 130 mm.

O resto da semana não deve ser diferente, com pancadas fortes, mas isoladas, ao longo da tarde.

470,1,,"Mais de 17 mil juízes recebem o benefício no país, a um custo de R$ 74 milhões por mês; maior gasto é da Justiça estadual de São Paulo

Mais de 17 mil juízes recebem o benefício no país, a um custo de R$ 74 milhões por mês; maior gasto é da Justiça estadual de São Paulo

Apenas em janeiro deste ano, o Judiciário brasileiro gastou mais de R$ 74 milhões com auxílio-moradia para cerca de 17 mil juízes e desembargadores. Ao final de 2018, o valor total gasto no ano pode ultrapassar os R$ 897 milhões, caso todos esses magistrados mantenham seus benefícios. O teto para o pagamento do auxílio-moradia, indenização estendida para todos os magistrados pelo ministro do STF Luiz Fux em 2014, é de R$ 4.377,73 por mês.

Os dados são resultado de um levantamento realizado pela Agência Pública com base nas informações do Conselho Nacional de Justiça (CNJ) e dos próprios tribunais.

A reportagem contabilizou todos os benefícios pagos por 61 dos 62 tribunais federais e estaduais de Justiça, Militares e do Trabalho, além do CNJ, que paga auxílio a apenas um magistrado, o juiz auxiliar Sérgio Ricardo de Souza, de R$ 4.158,85. Apenas o Tribunal de Justiça do Mato Grosso não respondeu até o fechamento desta reportagem. Os tribunais eleitorais, sejam o Superior ou os regionais, ficaram de fora do levantamento porque não pagam auxílio-moradia a seus magistrados. O mesmo ocorre com o Conselho da Justiça Federal.

O Tribunal de Justiça de São Paulo (TJSP) é o campeão dos pagamentos entre todos os demais tribunais brasileiros − foram mais de R$ 10,3 milhões em auxílio-moradia apenas em janeiro, quase 14% do total gasto no país com esse benefício. São Paulo gasta mais que o dobro do segundo tribunal mais caro, o de Justiça de Minas Gerais (TJMG), com R$ 4,4 milhões. Ao final de um ano, o TJSP pode gastar R$ 124,5 milhões apenas com esse benefício aos seus magistrados.

De um total de 2.536 juízes e desembargadores ativos no TJSP, apenas 178 não receberam os R$ 4.377,73 do auxílio-moradia em janeiro, o que representa 7% do total. Contudo, isso não significa que esses magistrados não tiveram direito a auxílios: entre esses 178, 165 receberam ao menos R$ 810 de auxílio-alimentação. Apenas 13 juízes e desembargadores não embolsaram nenhum tipo de indenização em janeiro.

Além disso, o TJSP fez em janeiro dois pagamentos de auxílio-moradia muito acima do teto do CNJ, de R$ 4.377,73. As juízas de direito Angela Moreno Pacheco de Rezende Lopes e Cláudia Vilibor Breda receberam, respectivamente, R$ 31 mil e R$ 30,3 de auxílio-moradia no mês. Conforme a Pública apurou, esses valores estão sendo pagos para Angela desde outubro de 2017, totalizando R$ 124 mil; e, para Cláudia, desde setembro de 2107, uma soma de R$ 150 mil.

A escrevente de Cláudia, Priscila Barbosa, informou que esse valor é devido à magistrada não ter recebido o auxílio-moradia antes de setembro do ano passado. Segundo a funcionária, os valores retroativos estão sendo pagos em seis parcelas. O gabinete da juíza Angela informou que a resposta deveria vir da assessoria de imprensa do TJ. Procurada, a assessoria confirmou que as duas magistradas recorreram ao auxílio-moradia tardiamente e recebem pagamentos retroativos parcelados.

Além das duas juízas, 59 magistrados do tribunal receberam indenizações para mudança de residência, reembolsos para aquisição de softwares e hardwares e livros, ajuda de custo para transporte e indenizações por atuação em Colégio Recursal. Juntos, eles embolsaram mais de R$ 435 mil apenas em janeiro. Quatro desses pagamentos individuais foram acima de R$ 25 mil. Esse tipo de benefício encaixa-se também na categoria de indenizações, assim como o auxílio-moradia e o alimentação.

Segundo a Pública apurou, ao menos dois outros tribunais também fizeram pagamentos de auxílio-moradia acima do teto em janeiro. Foram eles o Tribunal de Justiça do Mato Grosso do Sul, que pagou 212 benefícios acima dos R$ 4.337; e o de Justiça de Rondônia, que desembolsou 77 auxílios acima desse valor.

Procurados pela reportagem, nenhum dos tribunais respondeu porque descumpriram o teto de pagamento do auxílio.

A maior parte dos auxílios-moradia são pagos pelos Tribunais de Justiça. Juntos, eles desembolsaram R$ 50,4 milhões em janeiro. Em seguida, vêm os Tribunais do Trabalho, com R$ 15,6 milhões. Depois, os Tribunais Regionais Federais, com R$ 8,3 milhões. Por último, os Tribunais Militares, que gastaram R$ 345 mil no mês.

Nenhum ministro do STF recebe auxílio-moradia atualmente, contudo, a Pública apurou que 36 assessores e chefes de gabinete são beneficiários. Os valores foram de R$ 1,1 mil a R$ 5 mil em janeiro. Ao todo, o STF gastou mais de R$ 55 mil auxílio-moradia com esses funcionários no mês. No ano passado, foram mais de R$ 768 mil apenas com esse benefício.

O pagamento do auxílio-moradia e de outras indenizações, como a ajuda para mudança de residência, não é contabilizado no teto dos salários dos servidores públicos, de R$ 33,7 mil. Somando indenizações como auxílio-natalidade, pré-escola, saúde, alimentação e ajudas de custo, os tribunais brasileiros gastaram mais de R$ 110 milhões em auxílios com seus magistrados apenas em janeiro.

O pagamento do auxílio-moradia, antes restrito a ministros dos tribunais superiores e a alguns juízes estaduais, foi estendido a todos os juízes federais e, em seguida, aos demais magistrados por decisões do ministro Luiz Fux (STF) em 2014.

A própria filha do ministro Fux é uma das magistradas que recebem o benefício, segundo os dados do CNJ. Desembargadora do Tribunal de Justiça do Rio de Janeiro, além de receber os R$ 4,3 mil de auxílio-moradia, Marianna recebeu R$ 1.825 de auxílio-alimentação em janeiro.

Ainda em 2014, o CNJ regulamentou o auxílio-moradia, estabelecendo o teto de R$ 4.377,73, baseado no valor pago aos ministros do Supremo. O benefício não pode ser pago a quem possuir residência oficial à disposição, mesmo que não a utilize. Juízes ou desembargadores inativos também não podem receber o auxílio. O mesmo vale para quem tem algum benefício semelhante de outro órgão público. Para receberem o auxílio-moradia, os magistrados precisam requerer ao seu tribunal, indicando a localidade da sua residência.

Mesmo juízes que possuem residência própria perto do local onde trabalham recebem o auxílio-moradia. Segundo reportagem da Folha de S. Paulo, metade dos juízes que ganham auxílio-moradia em São Paulo tem imóvel próprio – um deles, o desembargador José Antonio de Paula Santos Neto, possui 60 propriedades na cidade. O juiz Sérgio Moro, do Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª região (TRF-4), responsável pelo julgamento dos processos da Lava Jato, também recebe o benefício, apesar de morar a 3 km do trabalho.

A continuidade ou não do auxílio-moradia pode ser definida no plenário do STF no próximo dia 22 de março, quando os ministros decidem se mantêm as decisões de Fux de quatro anos atrás. Como resposta, 1.300 juízes votantes pertencentes à Associação dos Juízes Federais (Ajufe) vão fazer uma paralisação em protesto contra o fim do auxílio nesta quinta-feira, dia 15.

474,1,,"Most Americans in a new poll support stricter gun regulations, with even a majority of National Rifle Association in the survey backing stiffer background checks.

Sixty-nine percent of NRA members expressed support for comprehensive background checks. A proposal to implement universal background checks would apply to all gun sales, rather than just purchases made at licensed retailers, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group.

Support for such a measure increases to 78 percent among gun owners who don’t belong to the NRA and to 89 percent for respondents who don’t own a firearm. The poll of 803 American adults was conducted by Monmouth University from March 2-5, weeks after a high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Comprehensive background checks are considerably more popular among gun owners than is a national firearms registry, a policy proposal often raised after mass shootings. Among those who don’t own guns, 79 percent support a firearms-purchase database, but only half of gun owners back such a proposal. The level of support drops to 31 percent among NRA members.

Although opinion polls indicate support for some gun control regulations, there’s been little movement at the federal level to pass new laws. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has not proposed a timeline for consideration of firearms regulation; last week, Congress turned its attention to an unrelated banking measure.

Many of the changes to firearms policy are instead coming from the retail sector. Walmart Inc., Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., Kroger Co. and L. L. Bean Inc. have all said they would stop selling firearms to 18- to 20-year-olds in the wake of the Florida shooting last month, in which a 19-year-old gunman was charged with killing 17 people. Orvis Co., an outdoor goods retailer, said it would sell firearms only to those under the age of 21 if they have completed a education and safety course. Dick’s also halted the sale of assault-style rifles.

Support for gun control measures is divided along party lines, but background checks drew broad support. The policy has the approval of 91 percent of Democrats, 83 percent of independents and 72 percent of Republicans. The partisan split over a firearms ownership database is more pronounced: Some 84 percent of Democrats favor such a measure, while only 45 percent of Republicans do.

NRA members, in particular, strongly opposed such a registry. Among members of the group, 79 percent expressed concern that a regulation such as increased background checks or a firearms purchase registry could be used to track the activities of Americans.

“There is still a stark political divide driven by special interests who represent about one-third of gun owners,” Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. “The NRA’s influence in Washington may still be powerful enough to maintain the status quo on national gun policy.”

478,2,,"Uma das maiores infâmias da ditadura civil-militar foi uso do aparelho do Estado para perseguir inimigos pessoais.

Havia pessoas que, não gostando de alguém ou tendo interesse na sua destruição, procurava os órgãos de repressão para fazer denúncias, verdadeiras ou não.

Pelo menos em um caso, a Lava Jato também serviu a este propósito. Trata-se de uma investigação sobre a Fecomércio, no Rio de Janeiro.

A velha mídia deu destaque a uma operação que fez buscas buscas e apreensões e efetuou uma prisão, a do ex-presidente da entidade, Orlando Diniz.

Mas nenhuma linha foi escrita sobre os antecedentes desta investigação, que envolve uma antiga disputa pelo orçamento bilionário que envolve Sesc e Senac, parte do sistema S que é mantido por contribuições compulsórias dos empregadores que incidem sobre a folha de salários.

De um Lado, está Orlando Diniz, que foi presidente da Fecomércio. De outro, Antônio José Domingues de Oliveira Santos, um dos mais longevos líderes sindicais da história do Brasil.

Oliveira Santos está no comando da Confederação Nacional do Comércio (CNC) desde 1980 — há 38 anos, portanto —, eleito na época com o apoio do general Golbery do Couto e Silva.

Em 2016, a Revista IstoÉ dinheiro publicou um perfil dele, em que o chama de “coronel do comércio” e destaca a longevidade de seu comando.

A revista o compara a Napoleão Bonaparte, que ficou 15 anos à frente do império francês, e Saddam Hussein, que teve 23 anos de poder absoluta no Iraque.

“Embora mandatos longevos sejam relativamente comuns nas entidades sindicais, empresariais e de trabalhadores no País, chama a atenção, por ser um recorde digno do Guiness Book, a duração do mandato do capixaba Antonio Oliveira Santos, 85 anos (hoje 87), no comando da Confederação Nacional do Comércio”, informa.

Desde que as mãos poderosas — e hábeis — de Golbery pesaram em favor de sua eleição no final da década 70 século passado, ninguém conseguiu tirá-lo da cadeia, exceto Orlando Diniz, que obteve na Justiça, durante um curto período, o afastamento dele do comando da CNC, em razão da rejeição de uma de suas contas pelo TCU.

A disputa foi uma das muitas que os dois travam desde que Orlando o enfrentou em uma eleição. Como costuma fazer com seus opositores, Oliveira reagiu com uma intervenção no Sesc e Senac, órgãos administrados pelas federações estaduais.

Só que, ao contrário de outros oponentes, como o do Rio Grande do Sul, Pernambuco e Piauí, que também sofreram intervenção, Orlando foi para o enfrentamento, numa luta que consumiu recursos milionários dos dois lados — no final, pagos com dinheiro do imposto sindical e das contribuições para o Sistema S.

Em abril do ano passado, sem conseguir remover o oponente, Oliveira compareceu à Lava Jato, com uma representação em que aponta os gastos elevados com honorários advocatícios para solicitar investigação na entidade.

Além da rejeição das contas pelo TCU, Oliveira Santos tem seus próprios pecados.

“As acusações contra o presidente da CNC são tão extensas quanto seu período à frente da entidade, e se renovam com uma impressionante rapidez. A mais recente delas diz respeito à locação de um apartamento de luxo na Barra da Tijuca para Cláudia Fadel, uma diretora do Sesc, pessoa próxima a Oliveira Santos. A entidade paga, desde abril, aluguel de R$ 7,5 mil pelo imóvel, além de ter desembolsado um seguro-caução de R$ 107,5 mil”, destacou a reportagem da IstoÉ Dinheiro, que é de 2016.

Mas, diante dos procuradores, Oliveira Santos se apresentou como se fosse um catão e se aproveitou de nomes investigados da Lava Jato para chamar a atenção dos procuradores.

Na banca que defende a Fecomércio do Rio, figurava Adriana Ancelmo, mulher do ex-governador Sérgio Cabral, e Oliveira Santos a cita num contexto de suspeita.

“O ex-governador teria se valido do escritório de advocacia do qual sua esposa é sócia, para o branqueamento de capitais oriundos de aventados esquemas de corrupção engendrados em seu governo à frente do Estado do Rio de Janeiro”, diz Oliveira Santos, em sua representação.

Se se considerar válido o argumento de que todo cliente de Adriana Ancelmo é suspeito, a lista é grande e envolve nomes que a Lava Jato corre só de ouvir sua menção.

Adriana teve um dos maiores escritórios do Rio de Janeiro e, entre seus clientes, está Paula Marinho, filha de João Roberto Marinho, dono do Grupo Globo.

Adriana defendeu Paula Marinho em pelo dois processos — por desentendimento de vizinhança num caso de um imóvel de sua empresa em Copacabana e outro, num caso contra Paula Lavigne, ex-mulher de Caetano Veloso.

A Fecomércio, na gestão de Orlando Diniz, também contratou os escritórios de Cristiano Zanin Martins, o advogado de Lula, e Rafael Valim, dono de uma editora que tem se destaca na publicação de obras que denunciam o golpe, além de Sérgio Bermudes e Ana Basílio, que é mulher do presidente do Tribunal Regional Federal da 1a. Região.

No relatório que apresentou para justificar o pedido de prisão de Diniz e de mandados de busca e apreensão, o Ministério Publico Federal descreve condutas suspeitas do presidente afastado da Fecomércio, mas, em relação aos escritórios de advocacia, não existe nada que comprometa a atuação dos advogados.

Um desses advogados, Rafael Valim, teve o escritório alvo de mandado de busca e apreensão e apenas um fato é mencionado para justificar a medida. Numa conversa telefônica interceptada, Valim diz a seu cliente que “tem boi na linha”, numa advertência de que a ligação está sendo grampeada.

Por conta disso, Valim foi apontado pelos procuradores como “operador jurídico” do esquema. O que é isso?

O Ministério Público Federal dá a entender que Valim daria orientações para encobrir condutas criminosas.

Ora, um advogado advertir o cliente de que ele poderia estar sendo grampeado não pode ser considerado crime nem no Brasil de hoje ou na União Soviética de Stálin nos anos 30 e 40. É obrigação. Conversas entre advogado e seu cliente devem ser protegidas, em qualquer circunstância.

Se é assim, por que o Ministério Público Federal foi para cima de Valim?

Advogados que estiveram no ato de desagravo a Valim, segunda-feira da semana passada, num restaurante em São Paulo, suspeitam que os procuradores, depois de atingirem alvos políticos, agora miram nos seus defensores.

Parecia delírio ou vitimismo de profissionais de Direito, mas a suspeita ganha corpo depois que começaram a aparecer manifestações que fazem eco à operação da Polícia Federal.

O professor Carlos Alberto Di Franco, colaborador do jornal O Estado de S. Paulo, assina artigo publicado ontem em que lança a suspeita contra a atuação do escritório do advogado de Lula.

“Segundo informações, foram pagos R$ 68,3 milhões em honorários ao escritório. Uma testemunha, o diretor regional do Sesc-RJ Júlio César Gomes, afirmou que Diniz acreditou que o escritório de Roberto Teixeira (sogro de Cristiano) ‘conseguiria a cadeira nacional para ele, em referência à Confederação Nacional do Comércio, principalmente para recuperar a presidência do SESC’”.

Júlio César Gomes foi afastado por Diniz da Fecomércio e, em razão disso, seu depoimento deveria ser visto com reserva. Além disso, quem acompanhou a disputa de Diniz com Oliveira Santos sabe que, até aqui, todas as decisões favoráveis a ele foram obtidas na Justiça.

Di Franco, numa manifestação surpreendente para quem lecionou ética em faculdades de comunicação, faz uma associação entre os elevados honorários da advocacia,o narcotráfico e a corrupção, para concluir:

“Dinheiro de origem duvidosa, roubado da população, pode ir para o bolso de advogados, numa boa? E tudo protegido pela força do anonimato. É um tema polêmica? Sim. Mas, como está, não dá. Está na hora de a OAB abrir uma discussão. Com serenidade, mas com seriedade”, afirma.

Ao que se sabe, o dinheiro das federações não é produto de roubo da população e, além disso, a questão de honorários elevados — e são elevados mesmo — vai além das entidades sindicais.

A Petrobras, segundo noticiou a Folha de S. Paulo, contratou na administração de Pedro Parente escritório de advocacia por R$ 200 milhões. O que o professor de ética Di Franco diria sobre isso?

Na disputa sindical entre os coronéis do comércio no Rio de Janeiro, certamente não há inocentes.

Mas o avanço da Lava Jato sobre um dos lados também é suspeito.

Não é demais lembrar que, pouco antes de entrar com a representação na Procuradoria contra o inimigo Diniz, Oliveira Santos autorizou a entidade a patrocinar no jornal O Globo um evento que teve a presença do juiz Sergio Moro.

Nestes tempos estranhos, iniciativas como estas acabam tendo um peso maior, porque, no aparato de Estado para investigação, parece haver uma divisão entre “nós e eles”.

Entre nós, blindagem. Contra eles, o peso da Justiça.

Estes tempos estranhos também revelam biografias. Hoje, no Superior Tribunal de Justiça, será julgada a ação que questiona o poder da CNC de intervir na administração estadual do Sesc e do Senac.

Antes da operação da Polícia Federal, havia a expectativa de que fosse considerada ilegal a intervenção, já que a legislação que regula o sistema S, de 1967, não prevê esse expediente.

Porém, com o alvo da intervenção na cadeia da Lava Jato — Orlando Diniz —, a tese perde força.

Além do mais, num recurso de última hora, o coronel da Confederação Nacional do Comércio resolveu contratar para sustentação oral um advogado tem currículo sob medida para tirar o inegável caráter político do julgamento.

O advogado será José Eduardo Martins Cardozo, que foi ministro da Justiça de Dilma Rousseff e ainda é filiado ao PT. Sua presença na defesa do Oliveira Santos foi devidamente registrada hoje pela coluna de Sônia Racy, do Estadão.

Cardozo é o personagem perfeito para fazer a disputa por poder político parecer apenas uma contenda jurídica.

484,1,,"Special counsel Robert Mueller's team is asking witnesses pointed questions about whether Donald Trump was aware that Democratic emails had been stolen before that was publicly known, and whether he was involved in their strategic release, according to multiple people familiar with the probe.

Mueller's investigators have asked witnesses whether Trump was aware of plans for WikiLeaks to publish the emails. They have also asked about the relationship between GOP operative Roger Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and why Trump took policy positions favorable to Russia.

The line of questioning suggests the special counsel, who is tasked with examining whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, is looking into possible coordination between WikiLeaks and Trump associates in disseminating the emails, which U. S. intelligence officials say were stolen by Russia.

Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion and has described the special counsel's investigation as ""illegal"" and a ""witch hunt.""

In one line of questioning, investigators have focused on Trump's public comments in July 2016 asking Russia to find emails that were deleted by his then-opponent Hillary Clinton from a private server she maintained while secretary of state. The comments came at a news conference on July 27, 2016, just days after WikiLeaks began publishing the Democratic National Committee emails. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said.

Witnesses have been asked whether Trump himself knew then that Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta, whose emails were released several months later, had already been targeted. They were also asked if Trump was advised to make the statement about Clinton's emails from someone outside his campaign, and if the witnesses had reason to believe Trump tried to coordinate the release of the DNC emails to do the most damage to Clinton, the people familiar with the matter said.

The White House spokesman at the time, Sean Spicer, would later say that then-candidate Trump had been ""joking"" when he called on Russia to hack his opponent's emails.

""In 2016, the hack of my emails was often treated as a politically interesting event,"" said Podesta to NBC News via email. ""For the record, it was a crime. Glad Mueller is trying to get to the bottom of everyone involved in that crime.""

Investigators are also asking questions about Trump's longtime relationship with Stone, the Republican operative, according to witnesses. Investigators have asked about Stone's contacts with WikiLeaks during the campaign and if he's ever met with Assange.

""They wanted to see if there was a scheme. Was Stone working on the side for Trump?"" after he officially left the campaign, one person interviewed by the special counsel's office said, adding that it seemed investigators wanted to know, ""Was this a big plot?""

Russia stole emails from the DNC and Podesta, according to U. S. intelligence officials, and released batches of them through WikiLeaks starting in July 2016 and up until the election.

As part of his plea agreement with the special counsel, former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos revealed that in a conversation in late April 2016, he was told by a professor with ties to Russian officials that they had ""dirt' on Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails."" A 10-page memo from Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released Saturday noted that the Justice Department's October 2016 application for a FISA warrant on another Trump foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, included the fact that Russian agents had previewed their hack and dissemination of stolen emails to Papadopoulos.

Investigators were interested in statements Stone made in the final month of the 2016 campaign that strongly suggested he was aware of information the group had before it became public and when it might be released. In one instance, he wrote on Twitter that ""it would soon be Podesta's time in the barrel."" Weeks later Podesta's stolen emails were released by WikiLeaks.

As WikiLeaks was strategically publishing stolen emails in the closing months of the campaign, Trump also publicly said he loved the group. He mentioned WikiLeaks 145 times during the last month of the 2016 campaign. In 2017, President Trump's CIA director, Mike Pompeo, would label the group a hostile non-state actor.

Investigators also have shown interest in any connections Stone has to WikiLeaks and Assange, its founder. Stone has said he communicated with Assange and WikiLeaks through an intermediary he described as a journalist.

The Atlantic reported this week that Stone exchanged direct messages on Twitter with WikiLeaks. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has said his committee should subpoena Twitter to produce any direct messages ""from and between the Twitter handles identified as relevant to the Russia investigation,"" including WikiLeaks, Assange and Stone. According to Schiff, Twitter has told the committee it won't produce such messages ""absent compulsion.""

Mueller's team has asked witnesses if Stone ever met with Assange. Stone has denied ever communicating directly with Assange.

Stone served briefly on the Trump campaign in 2015, leaving in August of that year. At the time he said he quit, while the campaign said he was fired.

Investigators have asked witnesses about Stone's time on the campaign and what his relationship was like with Trump after he left.

""How often did they talk? Who really fired him? Was he really fired?"" a witness said, describing the line of questioning.

In a statement, Stone said he had ""no advance knowledge of the content or source of information published by WikiLeaks.""

""I have not been interviewed by the special counsel,"" wrote Stone. ""I never discussed WikiLeaks, Assange or the Hillary disclosures with candidate Trump, before during or after the election. I have no idea what he knew about them, from who or when. I have never met Assange.""

Stone appeared before the House Intelligence Committee for four hours last September. In his prepared opening statement, which he also delivered publicly on the InfoWars YouTube channel, Stone denied that he ever engaged ""in any illegal activities on behalf of my clients, or the causes which I support."" He denied having direct contact with Assange and called any exchanges with Guccifer 2.0, which took credit for hacking the DNC, ""innocuous.""

And he said his tweet predicting that Podesta would spend time in the ""barrel"" was in the context of the coverage of the resignation of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, whom he called his ""boyhood friend and colleague,"" over allegations about business activities in Ukraine.

At that same July 2016 news conference where he referenced Clinton's missing emails, candidate Trump said he was open to lifting sanctions on Russia and possibly recognizing its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine. The U. S. and its European allies had sanctioned Russia because of its intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, which the Obama administration refused to recognize.

Investigators have asked witnesses why Trump took policy positions that were friendly toward Russia and spoke positively about Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to people familiar with the probe.

Investigators have also inquired whether Trump met with Putin before becoming president, including if a meeting took place during Trump's 2013 visit to Moscow for his Miss Universe pageant. Trump has given conflicting responses on when he first met Putin.

At least one witness was asked about Trump's business interests in Moscow and surmised afterward that the special counsel investigation may be focused on business dealings that took place during the campaign.

Witnesses also have been asked about Stone's connections to Manafort.

At least one witness has been asked about Trump aide Dan Scavino, specifically about any involvement he may have had in the campaign's data operation. Scavino currently runs the White House's social media operations and is one of Trump's closest aides.

NBC News reached out to Trump's legal team and the White House. The White House declined to comment on Scavino ""out of respect for the Office of Special Counsel and its process. ... The White House remains fully cooperative with the Office of Special Counsel and we look forward to [the investigation's] prompt conclusion.""

John Dowd, the president’s outside attorney, told NBC News, ""We do not discuss our knowledge of or communications with the special counsel.""

Beneficiária do Bolsa Família em fila de casa lotérica, em Nova Iguaçu

BRASÍLIA — O governo pretende mexer no programa Bolsa Família para introduzir o conceito de dignidade, segundo uma fonte a par do assunto. Também se cogitou trocar o nome por ""Bolsa Dignidade"", mas existem dúvidas se isso é possível e avalia-se o risco de eventual repercussão negativa da medida em ano eleitoral. Também está em discussão a possibilidade de pagar um adicional de R$ 20 para os beneficiários que realizarem trabalho voluntário.

Outra proposta em análise é reajustar o Bolsa Família para repor a inflação (que fechou 2017 em 2,95%) e mais parte do aumento do botijão de gás como uma forma de compensar o impacto da alta do produto no orçamento das famílias mais pobres. O último aumento do Bolsa ocorreu em meados de 2016, de 12,5%.

O presidente Michel Temer pediu ao ministro do Desenvolvimento Social, Osmar Terra, para apresentar uma proposta ainda em março, a fim de o aumento possa ser pago dentro de um mês. O ministro quer anunciar a medida antes de deixar o cargo para disputar uma cadeira na Câmara dos Deputados.

490,1,,"On a seemingly daily basis, we see attacks against the intellectual culture of the academic humanities, which, since the 1960s, have opened up spaces for leftists to develop critical theories of all kinds. Attacks from supposedly liberal professors and centrist op-ed columnists, from well-funded conservative think tanks and white supremacists on college campus tours. All rail against the evils of feminism, post-modernism, and something called “neo-Marxism” with outsized agitation.

For students and professors, the onslaughts are exhausting, and not only because they have very real, often dangerous, consequences, but because they all attack the same straw men (or “straw people”) and refuse to engage with academic thought on its own terms. Rarely, in the exasperating proliferation of cranky, cherry-picked anti-academia op-eds do we encounter people actually reading and grappling with the ideas of their supposed ideological nemeses.

Were non-academic critics to take academic work seriously, they might notice that debates over “political correctness,” ""thought policing,"" ""identity politics,"" etc. have been going on for thirty years now, and among left intellectuals themselves. Contrary to what many seem to think, criticism of liberal ideology has not been banned in the academy. It is absolutely the case that the humanities have become increasingly hostile to irresponsible opinions that dehumanize people, like emergency room doctors become hostile to drunk driving. But it does not follow therefore that one cannot disagree with the establishment, as though the University system were still beholden to the Vatican.

Understanding this requires work many people are unwilling to do, either because they’re busy and distracted or, perhaps more often, because they have other, bad faith agendas. Should one decide to survey the philosophical debates on the left, however, an excellent place to start would be Radical Philosophy, which describes itself as a “UK-based journal of socialist and feminist philosophy.” Founded in 1972, in response to “the widely-felt discontent with the sterility of academic philosophy at the time,” the journal was itself an act of protest against the culture of academia.

Radical Philosophy has published essays and interviews with nearly all of the big names in academic philosophy on the left—from Marxists, to post-structuralists, to post-colonialists, to phenomenologists, to critical theorists, to Lacanians, to queer theorists, to radical theologians, to the pragmatist Richard Rorty, who made arguments for national pride and made several critiques of critical theory as an illiberal enterprise. The full range of radical critical theory over the past 45 years appears here, as well as contrarian responses from philosophers on the left.

Rorty was hardly the only one in the journal’s pages to critique certain prominent trends. Sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Loic Wacquant launched a 2001 protest against what they called “a strange Newspeak,” or “NewLiberalSpeak” that included words like “globalization,” “governance,” “employability,” “underclass,” “communitarianism,” “multiculturalism” and “their so-called postmodern cousins.” Bourdieu and Wacquant argued that this discourse obscures “the terms ‘capitalism,’ ‘class,’ ‘exploitation,’ ‘domination,’ and ‘inequality,’” as part of a “neoliberal revolution,” that intends to “remake the world by sweeping away the social and economic conquests of a century of social struggles.”

One can also find in the pages of Radical Philosophy philosopher Alain Badiou’s 2005 critique of “democratic materialism,” which he identifies as a “postmodernism” that “recognizes the objective existence of bodies alone. Who would ever speak today, other than to conform to a certain rhetoric? Of the separability of our immortal soul?” Badiou identifies the ideal of maximum tolerance as one that also, paradoxically, “guides us, irresistibly” to war. But he refuses to counter democratic materialism’s maxim that “there are only bodies and languages” with what he calls “its formal opposite… ‘aristocratic idealism.’” Instead, he adds the supplementary phrase, “except that there are truths.”

Badiou’s polemic includes an oblique swipe at Stalinism, a critique Michel Foucault makes in more depth in a 1975 interview, in which he approvingly cites phenomenologist Merleau-Ponty’s “argument against the Communism of the time… that it has destroyed the dialectic of individual and history—and hence the possibility of a humanistic society and individual freedom.” Foucault made a case for this “dialectical relationship” as that “in which the free and open human project consists.” In an interview two years later, he talks of prisons as institutions “no less perfect than school or barracks or hospital” for repressing and transforming individuals.

Foucault’s political philosophy inspired feminist and queer theorist Judith Butler, whose arguments inspired many of today’s gender theorists, and who is deeply concerned with questions of ethics, morality, and social responsibility. Her Adorno Prize Lecture, published in a 2012 issue, took up Theodor Adorno’s challenge of how it is possible to live a good life in bad circumstances (under fascism, for example)—a classical political question that she engages through the work of Orlando Patterson, Hannah Arendt, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Hegel. Her lecture ends with a discussion of the ethical duty to actively resist and protest an intolerable status quo.

You can now read for free all of these essays and hundreds more at the Radical Philosophy archive, either on the site itself or in downloadable PDFs. The journal, run by an ‘Editorial Collective,” still appears three times a year. The most recent issue features an essay by Lars T. Lih on the Russian Revolution through the lens of Thomas Hobbes, a detailed historical account by Nathan Brown of the term “postmodern,” and its inapplicability to the present moment, and an essay by Jamila M. H. Mascat on the problem of Hegelian abstraction.

If nothing else, these essays and many others should upend facile notions of leftist academic philosophy as dominated by “postmodern” denials of truth, morality, freedom, and Enlightenment thought, as doctrinaire Stalinism, or little more than thought policing through dogmatic political correctness. For every argument in the pages of Radical Philosophy that might confirm certain readers' biases, there are dozens more that will challenge their assumptions, bearing out Foucault’s observation that “philosophy cannot be an endless scrutiny of its own propositions.”

- Under den här temaveckan hjälper biblioteket stockholmarna att stärka sin digitala egenmakt, säger Åke Nygren, projektledare på Digitala biblioteket. Oavsett hur aktiv man är på Internet kan man få lära sig mer om hur ens integritet kan påverkas i ett digitaliserat samhälle, och vad man kan göra för att skydda sitt privatliv på nätet.

Utifrån den interaktiva utställningen The Glass Room Experience kan du utforska hur Big data, algoritmer och artificiell intelligens påverkar våra privatliv. Utställningen är utvecklad av Tactical Technology Collective i Berlin, och visas på Kista och Hornstulls bibliotek 19-25 mars.

Både på Kista och på Hornstulls bibliotek kommer det under denna vecka dessutom att finnas en Data Detox Bar. Här får du hjälp att upptäcka dina digitala fotspår och att rensa bland den information du lämnar efter dig.

På respektive bibliotek anordnas även flera föreläsningar och workshops på temat integritet och säkerhet på Internet. Till exempel kommer Marcin Dekaminski, Jasmine Isdrake, Michael Kazarnowicz och Karolina Andersdotter att hålla i workshops och föreläsningar. Du hittar mer programinformation i kalendariet.

498,1,,"Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski reportedly refused to answer lawmakers’ questions about President Donald Trump and a meeting between Russians and the Trump campaign that took place in Trump Tower.

During what was described as “tense” testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, Lewandowski was said to have followed the pattern of other Trump campaign staff — like Hope Hicks and Steve Bannon — who have declined to answer questions about conversations with the then-candidate, even though events that occurred during the campaign are not covered by presidential executive privilege, according to reporters who spoke to lawmakers.

For his part, Lewandowski claimed that he had answered all “relevant” questions.

Read some of the tweets from reporters below.

Corey Lewandowski has finished testifying before the House Intel Committee. I know this because I was just almost run over by the media scrum trailing him as he left the U. S. Capitol.

Lewandowski leaves House Intel after a three-hour meeting, saying he answered all “relevant” questions. He claimed WH didn’t talk to him about testimony.

“There was no collusion, no cooperation, no coordination,” Lewandowski says to summarize his own testimony before House Intel.

Speaking to reporters after Lewandowski interview, @RepAdamSchiff introduces a new name that he wants to bring before House Intel Cmte: Stephen Miller

Schiff calls for Lewandowski subpoena, saying he would only answer “relevant” questions, not discussing topics such as the misleading statement about the Don Jr meeting w Russians and the firing of James Comey. He said witnesses can’t choose what topics they want to answer

Lewandowski: “There was no collusion, no cooperation, no coordination. Fact.”

Schiff said the questions that Lewandowski didn’t answer pertain to the drafting of the statement about the Trump Tower meeting, the firing of James Comey, and “any discussions that Mr. Lewandowski had with the president about the potential of firing of Bob Mueller.”

Schiff says Lewandowski did answer a bunch of other questions about his time after the campaign, though.

“We’ve requested a subpoena,” but unsure whether Republicans will agree, Schiff said.

Schiff says Lewandowski refused to answer questions about conversations with Trump, the Trump Tower meeting and the firing of Comey, and that Dems have asked for a subpoena.

GG feminino: mulheres que derrubaram preconceitos e estereótipos nos games   No Dia da Mulher, SporTV.com homenageia quatro mulheres de perfis, idades e funções diferentes no mundo gamer. Caju, Bizinha, Adriana Noronha e Branca Galdino relatam o que vivem no setor          Por Júlia Garcia, Rio de Janeiro            No último campeonato de Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) na Polônia, a premiação separou em mundos bastante distintos homens e mulheres. O valor distribuído foi de US$ 500 mil (cerca de R$ 1,6 milhão na cotação atual) no torneio masculino, enquanto no feminino apenas US$ 50 mil (cerca de 160 mil reais) foram oferecidos. Um abismo de 1000% entre os dois sexos. A equipe feminina da Keyd ficou em quarto lugar e levou cinco mil dólares. Esse cenário não é incomum em modalidades tradicionais esportivas. No futebol, por exemplo, Alex Morgan, a jogadora mais bem paga do mundo, recebe em um ano o que Neymar ganha em uma semana.     Em um cenário dominado por homens, as mulheres têm de lutar pelo reconhecimento. O League of Legends tem cerca de 100 milhões de jogadores no mundo. No Brasil, um milhão, sendo que aproximadamente 30% são mulheres. Porcentagem alta quando comparada ao Rainbow Six, que no Brasil tem o mesmo número de jogadores, mas apenas 5% do sexo feminino.     A diferença entre os valores distrubuídos aos torneios masculino e feminino. Valor em dólares       O mundo dos games é cercado por mulheres, (com nomes importantes que) todas desempenham um papel de respeito no esporte eletrônico. Cada uma em sua área, enfrentando preconceitos e impulsionando os eSports rumo à evolução profissional do cenário. Muitas ficam nos bastidores e outras sob os holofotes. E, neste Dia Internacional da Mulher, vamos destacar algumas que têm importante papel em alavancar eventos e carreiras.      Aos 19 anos, Bruna ""Bizinha"" é pro player de Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) pela Keyd, mas há mais de 15 anos tem ligação com o CS. A família fundou uma lan house em Itaguaí, interior no Rio de Janeiro, em 2007, época em que o CS 1.6 era febre. Mesmo com o empreendiemento, o contato com o game veio mais cedo, aos quatro anos, por influência do único irmão. No começo, eram jogos contra os bots (""robôs"" do computador) e, na pré-adolescência, resolveu jogar online e participar de times femininos. Isso, aos 12 anos. Deu uma breve pausa por dois anos quando entrou para a faculdade de Direito.      A volta foi triunfal. Em fevereiro, Bizinha participou do melhor desempenho de um time brasileiro no cenário internacional de CS:GO. Ao lado das companheiras da Keyd, ficou em quarto lugar no primeiro torneio fora do país que um time brasileiro feminino se classificou.      Bizinha afirma que já sofreu assédio e preconceito nos eSports, mas que não se deixa abalar com as agressões.     - O maior desafio é você continuar confiando em você mesma. Tendo perseverança de que, um dia, as coisas irão mudar, que a oportunidade finalmente vai surgir e você poderá ser recompensada por todas as vezes que achou que seria impossível - contou a jogadora.     Ela reconhece que graças aos homens, especificamente os da SK Gaming, o cenário mudou e passou a não ser mais visto como ""piada"". Entretanto, a pro player acredita que torneios separados ainda são necessários.     - Somos minoria no competitivo. Sendo assim, os campeonatos femininos existem para estimular mais meninas a começarem a jogar também. A premiação vem aumentando e esse número tende a crescer. Na medida em que tenhamos mais torneios, as empresas poderão enxergar com mais igualdade a premiação para o feminino.      Adriana Noronha, de 45 anos, trabalha com esporte há mais de 25 anos. Só há quatro entrou para os eSports sendo o braço direito e empresária do filho Felipe ""Yoda"", um dos maiores streamers do mundo e ex-jogador do League of Legends. Adriana começou a trabalhar aos 14 anos e desde então, atrelado ao emprego, cuida da família.      Quando entrou no mundo do eSports foi para assessorar e gerenciar a carreira do filho de 22 anos. E em seguida abandonou a vida no esporte. Porém, engana-se quem acha que a vida profissional de Adriana se resume apenas ao filho. Atualmente, a empresária gerencia uma empresa que cuida de outros 15 influenciadores dos games.     - Quando engravidei do Felipe eu tinha 24 anos. E não me atrapalhou. Dava 160 aulas de ginástica por mês na academia que trabalhava - relatou Adriana, que ainda tem outra filha.               Adriana Noronha (à direit) ainda faz palestras sobre executivas no universo gamer (Foto: Arquivo pessoal)        Adriana não acredita que exista o ""sexo frágil"" e ainda sonha com um cenário sem preconceito.     - O universo gamer é muito novo. Acredito que as mulheres ainda enfrentam muitas dificuldades com relação ao preconceito e ao respeito. No cenário ideal as mulheres não seriam subestimadas. Piadas e cantadas ainda demonstram um universo muito machista - contou Adriana.      Quem acompanha o League of Legends certamente conhece o maior astro nacional do jogo: Felipe ""brTT"", atualmente jogador do Flamengo. Há quase cinco anos, ao lado deste homem está Giuliana ""Caju"" Capitani, de 23 anos. Hoje famosa entre os fãs do LoL, noiva do ciberatleta durante muito tempo enfrentou o rótulo de ser ""mulher do brTT"".      - Tinha atenção por causa de um homem, no caso meu noivo, então para o público isso era vergonhoso - relatou a estudante de publicidade.     No entanto, brTT sempre reconheceu o papel de Caju em sua carreira. No Prêmio CBLoL 2017, ao receber o título de melhor atirador, o jogador se emocionou ao homenagear a noiva.     - Quero agradecer primeiro a minha mulher. Se não fosse por ela, com certeza não estaria segurando esse troféu. Nem jogando eu estaria. Obrigado por sempre me apoiar, estar junto de mim. Ela sempre me ajudou a superar meus problemas e a me levantar - disse brTT.           BrTT vence o prêmio de melhor atirador do ano       Caju trabalha impulsionando as redes sociais do jogador e filtrando as propostas de patrocínio. Carinhosamente apelidada de ""mãe"" pelos 210 mil seguidores, Caju reconhece que o mercado ainda está distante de ser o ideal.     - A mulher no LoL e no CS sempre vai ter a dúvida do público. Nunca vão confiar 100% no trabalho delas, nunca vão acreditar que realmente são capazes. O pé com elas tá sempre ali atrás. A maioria acredita que é sorte ou diminuem o mérito delas por ser um campeonato só para mulheres, dizendo ""assim é mais fácil"". Eu acredito que, quando uma mulher parar de ser uma novidade, parar de surpreender só por ser uma mulher, aí estaremos no momento perfeito - analisou.      A estudante foi conquistando espaço e respeito aos poucos, mas durante muito tempo recebeu mensagens negativas, assim como várias mulheres do meio dos jogos eletrônicos.     - O cenário gamer quatro anos atrás rejeitava com pedras as mulheres que buscavam um espaço. Lembro que, se aparecia uma streamer o chat dela lotava de ódio, e isso assustava. Eu mesma, como a primeira garota que teve mais visibilidade no LoL brasileiro, sofri absurdos com aquilo - contou Caju.      Sempre caminhando ao lado do astro, Caju frequentemente tem o nome ligado ao jogador do Flamengo. Ela aponta até um ""falso respeito"".     - Comigo aconteceu muito o falso respeito. Respeitavam o meu noivo e acabavam me tratando super bem por ser a namorada dele, mas o respeito era por ele - conta.     Em 2018, Giuliana pretende se desatrelar seu nome ao brTT e se firmar como personalidade pública.      Em 2017, quem circulou pelos eventos como Encontro das Estrelas (com a equipe da SK Gaming), Comic Con e CBLoL, encontrou Branca Galdino, de 47 anos. Ora como assessora de imprensa, ora como produtora de eventos, Branca sempre se desdobrou para atender aos clientes. Começou em 2012 escrevendo matérias para um site especializado em games.                Branca Galdino e a equipe da Keyd em 2017 (Foto: Arquivo pessoal)        Aos poucos foi conhecendo ínumeros atletas e organizações e logo foi convidada a assessorar grandes nomes como João ""Felps"", Keyd e a Games Academy, do astro Gabriel ""Fallen"". Mesmo com o currículo, Branca durante muito tempo disse ser invisível ao mundo gamer, mas, que aos poucos, quebrou essa ""transparência"".     - Existe o preconceito por ser mulher, por não ser novinha, por não ser gamer ou seguir os esteriótipos do cenário. Se você não consegue andar nesse perfil, você tem dificuldade para conseguir a atenção e o respeito que merece - analisou Branca.     Na visão da assessora, a mudança no cenário veio quando empresas incluíram nos contratos a obrigação de incluir mulheres nas equipes.     - Não fico ""ofendida"" em ter um Dia da Mulher, serve como lembrança. Precisamos ter um reconhecimento, um carinho diferenciado, e até nos lembrar que precisamos nos amar mais, ser feminina, lutar pelos nossos ideais bem naquele estilo: ""há que endurecer-se, mas sem jamais perder a ternura"" - concluiu Branca.      Seja ela uma empresária, mãe, assessora, estudante ou pro player, essas mulheres representam apenas uma pequena fração do universo feminino nos games. O respeito, acima de tudo, precisa existir com cada pessoa. Quando você faz o seu papel, o jogo muda.

509,1,,"Os problemas emocionais não são uma escolha, e ninguém deseja atravessar uma depressão nem passar por momentos de ansiedade. Eles simplesmente podem surgir, após um período de acúmulo de situações e circunstâncias complicadas em nossas vidas.

Existe uma falsa crença de que a ansiedade e a depressão são sinais de fraqueza e de incapacidade diante da vida. Mas não, uma pessoa com ansiedade, depressão ou sintomas mistos NÃO está louca e nem tem uma personalidade fraca ou inferior aos outros.

É triste e esgotador lutar contra isso, mas é uma realidade social que não podemos ignorar. Assim, apesar dos avanços da ciência, o inconsciente moderno que envolve nossa sociedade ainda pensa que os problemas emocionais e psicológicos são sinônimos de fragilidade e vulnerabilidade.

Por isso, dado que a depressão e a ansiedade não são contempladas como feridas que precisam de atenção, é comum ouvir discursos circulares com argumentos do tipo “relaxe”, “não é para tanto”, “comece a se mexer, a vida não é isso”, “você não tem razões para chorar”, “comece a amadurecer”, etc.

São comuns, não é verdade? De fato, é provável que em algum momento tenhamos sido vítimas ou até proferido este tipo de discurso. Por isso é fundamental realizar um exercício de conscientização e dar à dor emocional a importância que ela tem e merece.

Assim, da mesma forma que não iríamos ignorar a dor causada por fortes pontadas no estômago ou uma enxaqueca terrível, não deveríamos ignorar a dor emocional.

Não podemos esperar que estas feridas emocionais se curem sozinhas, devemos trabalhar para extrair delas o significado presente em seus sintomas.

Ou seja, devemos consultar um psicólogo que nos ajude e nos proporcionar estratégias para fazer frente a esta grande dor emocional causada pela ansiedade e pela depressão.

Seguindo com nosso exemplo, assim como deixamos de consumir a lactose quando descobrimos que somos intolerantes a ela, devemos “deixar de consumir”aqueles pensamentos e circunstâncias que infeccionam nossa ferida emocional.

Não valem curativos ou vendas: devemos limpá-las e curá-las verdadeiramente.

Por isso, neste artigo pretendemos normalizar aquelas sensações das pessoas que possuem problemas emocionais deste tipo. Vejamos mais sobre eles para podermos compreender e nos conscientizar…

As sensações que nos invadem com a ansiedade são muito similares às que surgem em um passeio de montanha russa em que começamos a nos sentir mal.

Coloquemo-nos nesta situação. Fomos passar o dia em um parque de diversões no qual encontramos uma montanha russa incrível e decidimos andar nela. Para fazer isso, temos que esperar em uma longa fila até que chegue a nossa vez.

O dia é quente e o sol está batendo forte em nossa cabeça, o que nos causa uma grande dor e mal-estar físico. Sentimo-nos cansados e não temos vontade de subir no vagão, mas fazemos isso, porque afinal estamos ali para aproveitar.

Uma vez sentados, nosso coração começa a bater forte, tudo dá voltas ao nosso redor, os vagões giram 360 graus várias vezes, nos submergimos em túneis escuros e tudo parece nos atacar.

Nossa respiração se acelera e nosso coração não pode parar. Sentimos que de um momento ao outro vai acontecer alguma coisa conosco. Nossas sensações estão bagunçadas, algo nos aprisiona no peito, ficamos imóveis e sem capacidade de reação.

Não podemos evitar pensar em coisas negativas. Gritamos, choramos e nos queixamos, mas ninguém nos ouve, nem sequer nós mesmos. Pedimos desesperadamente que tudo aquilo pare, e sentimos que estamos morrendo na tentativa.

No entanto, não conseguimos fazer com que nosso vagão freie, pois ele só parará quando acabarem os minutos programados para a viagem.

Neste sentido, um ataque de ansiedade é igual a uma viagem que nos faz mal em uma montanha russa. Em um dado momento tudo vai acabar, mas não sabemos quando nem como, por isso manter o controle diante desta incerteza é algo tão difícil de fazer.

Quem sofre de depressão sente que o mundo está envolto em névoa. Pouco a pouco vai perdendo a ilusão por tudo que o rodeia, não há nada que anime ou motive, é difícil estudar ou ir ao trabalho, e a pessoa se sente imensamente triste ou irritável.

A depressão é a gota que faz transbordar o copo, um copo que está cheio de situações e circunstâncias complicadas que nos fizeram mal e mexeram conosco negativamente.

Por isso é importante que, quando nos dermos conta de que algo vai mal, consultemos um profissional que nos ajude e dê coerência emocional ao que está acontecendo conosco.

Ter problemas emocionais não é uma escolha. Uma pessoa com depressão não diz ‘Quero me sentir mal e me coloco em um poço de tristeza para ver se me afogo com ela’. Isso não funciona assim. Na verdade, isso pode acontecer com qualquer um de nós.

Ninguém está livre das garras da depressão e da ansiedade

A depressão e a ansiedade não são sinais de fraqueza, mas sim de força. Estes problemas emocionais não aparecem da noite para o dia, mas surgem pouco a pouco por causa das dificuldades e do esgotamento emocional.

Elas também não são consequência de uma escolha pessoal. Não podemos dizer se queremos ou não queremos que nos acompanhem. Ambos os problemas emocionais são derivados da luta contra as dificuldades da vida que nos acompanham e, portanto, por termos tentados permanecer fortes por tempo demais.

Não podemos nos esquecer disso, pois ninguém está livre de se relacionar com a ansiedade e a depressão em algum momento da sua vida, seja de maneira direta ou indireta.

Prestemos atenção, compreendamos estes problemas e, sobretudo, não julguemos nem a nós nem aos outros…

511,1,,"O ano passado foi o primeiro desde 2012 sem ao menos uma animação entre as cinco maiores arrecadações nos cinemas dos Estados Unidos*. Além das fronteiras do país, porém, alguns dos lançamentos mais marcantes saíram justamente desse gênero. Continuações como as de “Paddington” e “Tadeo Jones” chegaram em sexto e terceiro lugar nas bilheterias de mercados importantes na Europa (Reino Unido e Espanha, respectivamente), enquanto “Your Name” alcançou um público ainda maior mundo afora depois de se tornar o filme mais visto na história do Japão na temporada anterior.

O caso de “Viva: A Vida É Uma Festa” parece ser parte de um fenômeno semelhante, mesmo que com outras proporções. Em seu país de origem, sede dos estúdios Disney/Pixar, o longa não passou da 14ª posição no ranking de público considerando somente as estreias de 2017. Foi no México, vizinho ao sul, que a produção encontrou a recepção aguardada e chegou ao topo do pódio de todos os tempos logo após completar um mês em cartaz.

Há muitas formas de compreender o sucesso desses títulos individualmente.

512,1,,"“Corra!”: o terror de uma sociedade racista

No primeiro longa de Jordan Peele, não há monstro mais assustador do que o homem branco

Quem chega desavisado a uma sessão de “Corra!” tem motivos de sobra para se surpreender. Logo que os protagonistas surgem em tela, o rapaz pergunta à namorada se os sogros, que o casal se prepara para visitar pela primeira vez, sabem que ele é negro. Ela, até com certa tranquilidade, assegura que sua família não é racista — o pai diz que votaria em Obama para um eventual terceiro mandato, veja só. Como em uma versão de “Adivinhe Quem Vem Para Jantar” atualizada para os Estados Unidos do século 21, esse trecho coloca a tensão social no centro da narrativa.

A maneira de tratar a temática, no entanto, leva o filme para outros caminhos. O desconforto que Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) deixa transparecer ali, entre um olhar desconfiado e um suspiro de compreensão esforçado, ganha corpo mais adiante seguindo várias convenções do terror. Para Jordan Peele, roteirista e diretor, o preconceito em suas mais diversas manifestações é encarado como um monstro, um “demônio social” capaz de assustar mais do que qualquer criatura inventada.

Situações como a retratada na sequência de abertura — um negro perdido à noite numa vizinhança branca — carregam o tom hostil e o caráter excludente da realidade, mas ganham contornos diferentes quando vistos pela lente do gênero, através da qual tudo é possível.

Os diálogos ajudam a expôr a gravidade do problema, em especial quando envolvem Rod (Lil Rel Howery), amigo do personagem principal e voz do espectador em cena. Seu bom humor desarma a audiência, distraindo o foco para a comédia imediatamente antes de o longa promover um susto. A aparição do veado na pista antes do atropelamento, por exemplo, tem maior impacto porque, segundos antes, todos no carro riam ao telefone, levando junto o público.

Somente essa cena traz consigo uma dúzia de detalhes relevantes para o desenrolar da história. A brincadeira de Rose (Alisson Williams) sobre os ciúmes do namorado, por exemplo, ganha outro sentido em retrospectiva, depois que eles voltam a se falar pelo celular. O fato de Chris abandonar o bicho ferido pelo caminho também muda em grau de importância posteriormente, quando descobrimos mais sobre seus traumas e arrependimentos.

Bastante inventiva, a direção emprega recursos inteligentes para costurar esses pequenos momentos de choque em uma linha coerente. Determinadas imagens são inseridas ao longo da trama, apresentadas num contexto e depois interpretadas de outra forma, o que cria conexões de identificação fácil. Na cena em que se livra do sogro (Bradley Whitford), o protagonista usa como arma os chifres de um animal da mesma espécie daquele morto no acidente; na conversa com a garota antes da viagem, ele diz que não quer ser perseguido por alguém com uma espingarda — justamente o que acontece quando o terror toma conta.

Essas rimas visuais funcionam bem porque a atmosfera ao redor delas é tão intimidadora. No percurso até o desfecho explosivo, o longa usa a habilidade da mãe (Catherine Keener) em técnicas de hipnose para destruir as defesas de Chris (e do espectador, que se coloca no lugar dele) e, assim, abrir espaço para que seus medos ganhem vida, expressados de maneiras cada vez mais radicais. Nesse sentido, sons específicos induzem sensações específicas (vale tanto para a trilha sonora quanto para a colher que toca a xícara num movimento ritmado e apreensivo), e todo gesto ou troca de palavras parece dizer algo além do que realmente vemos ou ouvimos.

Em algumas ocasiões, no entanto, Peele se rende a truques mais simples do gênero que, embora consigam cumprir suas funções na trama, soam gratuitos pela maneira como são armados. O trecho em que Walter (Marcus Henderson) corre em direção à câmera, por exemplo, parece deslocado de seu entorno. Problema semelhante afeta o personagem do cunhado (Caleb Landry Jones), que às vezes surge exageradamente acima do tom e foge da aparência de normalidade da família — na comparação com outros filmes do gênero, seu efeito em cena seria como “mostrar o monstro cedo demais”.

A direção não chega a trair seus princípios nesses momentos, mas definitivamente se destaca mais quando confia no próprio discurso sem a obrigação de deixar essas provocações explícitas. Isso à parte, o filme jamais perde seu norte e mantém o compromisso com o terror e suas bases até o último segundo: a virada final pega o espectador imerso na urgência dos acontecimentos extraordinários da trama e subverte suas expectativas quando traz o foco outra vez para a realidade, deixando no ar o temor da violência policial.

A virada final pega o espectador imerso na urgência dos acontecimentos extraordinários da trama e subverte suas expectativas

Tamanha habilidade para relacionar o terror real (o comentário racista que marginaliza, a objetificação disfarçada de elogio) e o terror de cinema (o transplante de cérebros, os flashes que resgatam a consciência) não parece ser sorte de principiante. Estreante no comando de longas e no próprio gênero em qualquer formato, Peele tem a seu favor experiência na televisão. Em “Key & Peele”, seu programa de esquetes de humor exibido entre 2012 e 2015, o diretor-roteirista já colocava à prova várias das técnicas e temáticas presentes em “Corra!”.

Formato e gênero mudam, mas o interesse em contextos que permitem discussões sobre problemas reais permanece o mesmo. A comédia passa ao segundo plano, enquanto o suspense e o horror, que apareciam frequentemente em segmentos da série, se tornam centrais. Se antes Peele conseguia fazer rir quando colocava personagens negros em espaços predominantemente ocupados por brancos, agora ele revela a face mais aterrorizante dessa realidade — em um dos filmes mais instigantes já feitos sobre ela.

516,2,,"A self-published “study” claims that eating too many fatty foods can cause homosexuality or make you transgender.

Author Rita Strakosha, who says she has “an M. P.S. degree in Clinical Psychology from Albanian University”, sent the 56-page document to PinkNews after self-publishing it as an e-book on Amazon.

In the document, which she has also put up for free on her website, attempts to link homosexuality to an unhealthy diet.

It claims: “Homosexuals… [often eat] large amounts of high glycemic index foods and fat, or eating an imbalanced diet, leaning toward carbohydrates. Some studies show an increased rate of obesity among homosexuals.

“Gay men, lesbian and bisexual women report a higher odds of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption than straight men and women.

“Access to a high calorie diet and alcoholic drinks was limited to the social elite circles in the past. Homosexuality as well appears to have been more frequent among that group.”

The paper ties homosexuality to fats, sugars and alcohol, proceeding to claim that cutting them out of your diet can “prevent the return of homosexual attractions”.

Stars You Didn't Know Were Gay Or Bisexual

The Stars You Didn’t Know Have An LGBT Sibling

The Straight Stars Who Went Gay For Pay

It argues that following a healthy diet with no sugar and sleeping adequately will ‘cure’ homosexuality in an individual and prevent its return.

It directs people to avoid “steer clear of… heavy or rich foods, fatty or fried meals, spicy dishes, citrus fruits and carbonated drinks”, if they want to stay heterosexual. So chicken nuggets are off the menu.

Meanwhile, apparently “keeping a healthy diet with no sugar, low in high glycemic-index foods, in fat” will be enough to prevent those gay urges.

If you follow those instructions, the author says the “sexual partner preference of the person [may move] toward the heterosexual end in the Kinsey scale”.

The study quotes an ancient Chinese spiritualist, who directs: “In spring man may permit himself to ejaculate once every three days, but in summer and autumn he should limit his ejaculations to twice a month.

“During the cold of winter, a man should preserve his semen and avoid ejaculation altogether. One ejaculation in winter is one hundred times more harmful than an ejaculation in the spring.”

PinkNews contacted the author for comment, but perhaps understandably she has not yet responded.

Another ‘study’ recently claimed that homosexual behaviour in women developed only because men get ‘turned on’ by it.

518,1,,"Sverigedemokraterna sopar banan med de andra partierna i sociala medier, visar Aftonbladets genomgång.

– SD har prioriterat sociala medier och nu får de betalt, säger André Assarsson, expert på digital marknadsföring.

KD, L och MP är sämst enligt statistiken – och alla riskerar samtidigt att åka ur riksdagen.

Sverigedemokraterna är överlägsna när det gäller att engagerapå Facebook, den sociala medie-kanal som når överlägset flest svenskar. Aftonbladets genomgång visar att partiet utklassar konkurrensen, vecka efter vecka.

– Det är inte förvånande. Andra partier har haft bra relationer till etablerade medier och prioriterat dem. SD har byggt upp en stark infrastruktur på nätet. Ger du kärlek till en kanal så får du kärlek tillbaka, säger André Assarsson, moderat-märkt konsult på pr-byrån Miltton Labs.

Själv säger Joakim Wallerstein, kommunikationschef på SD:

– Vi driver frågor som människor bryr sig om. Du jobbar själv för en tidning som inte låter oss annonsera och som delägs av ett parti. Vi har inte de kanalerna, vi satsar på sociala medier.

Populistiska partier och rörelser lyckas bäst på Facebook i länder över hela Europa. Framgångarna för Donald Trump, det tyska partiet AfD och brexit-rörelsen har till stor del tillskrivits förmågan att mobilisera väljare på sociala medier. AfD fick dessutom fick draghjälp från den amerikansk byrån Harris Media med att identifiera målgrupper, mejsla fram budskap och mobilisera väljare. Enligt Washington Posts granskning utklassade AfD konkurrensen på Facebook – och fick hela 12,6 procent av rösterna i valet.

– Sverigedemokraterna har ett tydligt fokus på att driva engagemang genom att använda rädsla och misstro som främsta redskap. Det har tyvärr alltid varit effektivt för den typen av rörelser. Vi vill tilltala väljare med en hoppfull och optimistisk framtidsbild och vi vill att de ska engageras av positiva känslor, säger Henrik Karlsson, kommunikationschef för MP.

Sociala medier har tidigare varit ett gratisalternativ för att nå ut med budskap för de som inte har råd eller tillgång till etablerade medier eller traditionella reklamkanaler. Men den senaste tiden har Facebook skruvat om sina algoritmer, alltså det som styr vad du ser i ditt flöde, och gjort det allt svårare för företag, organisationer och partier att synas.

Numera har man i princip två alternativ för att nå ut med sina inlägg. Det första är att köpa annonser och exponering. Samtliga partier Aftonbladet talat med säger också att de kommer öka sina reklaminvesteringar i sociala medier inför valet.

– Vår totala valbudget är på drygt 70 miljoner kronor, varav ungefär hälften läggs på reklam. Vår annonsering fördelas på många olika medieslag, men det blir mer socialt än förra valet, säger Centerpartiets kommunikationschef Ola Spännar.

Statistik som Socialbakers tagit fram för Aftonbladets räkning visar att alla partier i varierande grad köper annonsering för inlägg från sin Facebook-sida. I vilken omfattning de använder så kallade ”dark ads”, alltså målgruppsanpassade annonser, vet ingen.

Kristdemokraterna verkar i alla fall enligt samma statistik sponsra flest inlägg. De får också störst utväxling för sina annonser, i form av interaktioner.

Det andra sättet att nå ut är att styra om mot mer så kallat ”engagerande innehåll”, som folk delar och kommenterar, vilket automatiskt ger större spridning. Men detta kan leda till ett högre tonläge i debatten, varnar bedömare.

– Ilska flyger mycket bättre än kärlek. Så fort vi är emot någonting och blir arga så får det mer engagemang, säger Judith Wolst, expert på sociala medier.

– Vi ser redan nu en hårdare ton i sociala medier från partier och politiskt engagerade människor. Men vi ska också komma ihåg att det finns många goda krafter på sociala medier och det är de vi vill nå.

André Assarsson på Miltton Labs varnar de mer etablerade partier för att skruva upp tonläget allt för mycket i jakten på delningar.

– Tar man genvägen genom en mer attackmässig mobilisering kommer man kanske vinna på kort sikt, men tappa målgruppen på lång sikt. SD är lika aggressiva i tv och debatter som på sociala medier, det kan inte andra partier vara.

SD:s försprång bör oroa andra partier, säger han.

– Det är jättesvårt att nå väljare i dag, men med sociala medier kan man nå dem från morgon till kväll och ända in i vallokalen. Dessutom får du trovärdighet, om Vänsterpartiet säger att de är bra så tror ingen på dem, men när din granne eller farmor delar deras sida på Facebook litar du på det.

524,2,,"NEW YORK, NY—Donald J. Trump has told Fox and Friends that he believes the U. S. “should never have allowed” Canada to gain independence.

The President freely admits to being “a little rusty” on Canadian history, but feels confident that the United States owned Canada “at some point”, and claims giving it back was a “major mistake”.

BREAKING: Trump Changes From Orange To Green In Honour Of St. Paddy’s Day

The former reality tv star was responding to a question about Puerto Rico possibly becoming the 51st state of the US, when he made the statement. “It used to be 51 you know, when we had Canada,” Trump said, pointing to an American flag, “Or 52 if you count Mexico which I never will, no matter how much they beg.”

The interviewer Brian Kilmeade, seemed unmoved by Trump’s remark and asked him to explain his understanding of Canadian/American history, as the Fox host began scribbling notes:

As the host nodded along, Trump explained that America got a “terrible deal” with Canada who “stole” the land over a thousand years ago “or something like that”.

“Well now your elected, what are you going to do about it?” Kilmeade asked. “Forcefully take Canada and claim it as part of America?”

“I think that’s gotta be an option,” Trump responded. “You know, they’ve got a lot of oil up there, a lot.”

“I’m not sure there is any evidence to support this theory, Donald,” Kilmeade intervened. “I mean wasn’t Canada founded by Britain and France who invaded–” “No, are you kidding me?” Trump interrupted. “You think that either of those guys know the first thing about war? No Canada has belonged to America since Jesus’ time, and that’s a fact.”

Shortly after the controversial interview, Trump reiterated his stance towards Canada with a tweet that was deleted 20 minutes later, not before being retweeted over 6,000 times.

Um estudo realizado em 2015 descobriu que indivíduos que têm o hábito de falar palavrão apresentam um Q. I. maior. Conseguir distribuir xingamentos pelo maior número de vezes em um intervalo de um minuto estava ligado a uma pontuação mais elevada em um teste de Quociente de Inteligência.

Isso porque, de acordo com a pesquisa, um vasto vocabulário de palavrões seria sinal de força retórica, ou seja, boa capacidade de argumentação e formulação de ideias. O mesmo levantamento mostrou que quem é bagunceiro e dorme tarde também tinha melhores avaliações nos testes.

De acordo com uma pesquisa feita com 276 participantes, pessoas que falam palavrão são mais honestas e íntegras do que aquelas que não costumam usar palavras chulas no cotidiano.

O levantamento observou que as pessoas tendem a falar palavrões mais como uma forma de se expressar do que uma maneira de prejudicar o próximo e que a honestidade foi associada a níveis mais altos de xingamentos nos experimentos realizados com os voluntários.

Por fim, é possível dizer com base em um outro trabalho científico, que falar palavrão faz com que uma pessoa seja mais feliz no geral. Isso porque o hábito tem efeito direto no alívio de dores, favorece a expressão de sentimentos, promove conexões sociais e melhora da saúde física e mental.

Segundo o estudo, xingar melhora a circulação sanguínea, eleva a liberação de endorfinas e promove sensação de calma, controle e bem-estar.

531,1,,"Nunca fomos tão fortes. No último ano, mulheres denunciaram publicamente homens poderosos em casos de assédios. Organizaram manifestações em diferentes países contra o feminicídio e pela manutenção e ampliação de direitos. Criaram redes de apoio para ajudar vítimas de violência doméstica, de agressões e de estupros. Desenvolveram grupos de debate e de apoio mútuo nas redes sociais. Discutiram e condenaram o machismo, o racismo e a homofobia e trouxeram força para a nova onda de um movimento que tem mudado mentalidades, comportamentos e relações. Diante de tamanha mobilização, “feminismo” foi escolhida a palavra de 2017 pelo dicionário americano Merriam-Webster e a busca pelo termo no Google cresceu 200% desde 2016. “Estamos em um momento em que o feminismo se tornou a grande força de enfrentamento não só do machismo, mas que leva adiante a luta anti-racista e pelos direitos das mais diversas minorias políticas”, afirma a filósofa Marcia Tiburi, autora do recém-lançado “Feminismo em Comum” (Rosa dos Tempos).

Entre os marcos do feminismo atual estão as redes de solidariedade desenvolvidas por mulheres. A maioria de apoio para vítimas de violência. “São alternativas criadas já que as instituições tradicionais não são responsáveis o suficiente”, afirma Tiburi. As conexões se dão, em grande parte, pelas redes sociais. O Fórum Nacional de Políticas Públicas para Mulheres é um dos grupos de referência, começou como uma página no Facebook e depois migrou para o Whatsapp e hoje inclui pessoas de todo o País. “A ideia inicial era trocar informações sobre cursos e artigos e reunir contatos”, afirma Ana Victoriano, dona da iniciativa. “Mas hoje se tornou uma comunidade de ajuda a vítimas de agressões. Não imaginei que tomaria essa proporção.” Os pedidos de ajuda chegam diariamente e, por meio da rede, os contatos são feitos para que as mulheres possam receber orientação adequada. Depois de passar meses apanhando do marido, a advogada Maíra Moura Soares Neves, 41 anos, procurou Ana em outubro de 2017 e conseguiu deixar o casamento em que era agredida constantemente e do qual se via refém. “Em qualquer conversa, ouvia gritos de vagabunda ou recebia tapas”, diz. Moradora da cidade de Barra do Bugres, a 180km de Cuiabá (MT), era casada com um delegado e não tinha como denunciá-lo em uma delegacia. “Com certeza iam engavetar meu caso.” Maíra então usou o Facebook para pedir ajuda a Ana, que acionou conhecidas em São Paulo. Elas falaram com juristas no Mato Grosso que indicaram uma promotora em uma cidade próxima a dela. “Criaram uma corrente de ajuda”, diz. Em pouco tempo, uma denúncia foi feita contra o ex-marido de Maíra e ela se separou. A mesma promotora foi quem a ajudou a retirar seus pertences da antiga casa. Ao contar sua história, Maíra chora, respira fundo e conclui: “Eu estava de mãos atadas, mas essa rede de mulheres me salvou.”

Duas campanhas recentes que surgiram nos Estados Unidos dão o tom da amplificação das transformações: “Me Too” (“eu também”, em português), em que mulheres expuseram abusadores contando suas histórias; e Time’s Up (algo como “esse tempo acabou”, em tradução livre), que inclui a criação de um fundo para ajudar vítimas de assédio sexual na indústria do entretenimento em Hollywood. Além dessas iniciativas, o fim das “grid girls”, garotas que frequentavam os locais de provas da Fórmula 1 com roupas minúsculas, também é um indício da mudança de postura em relação às mulheres. Outro exemplo é o latino-americano Ni Una Menos, que organiza passeatas anuais contra o feminicídio. O movimento chegou também ao Oriente Médio. No Irã, em janeiro e fevereiro deste ano, mulheres protestaram contra a obrigatoriedade do uso do véu, em vigor desde 1979. Cerca de 30 foram presas em uma manifestação recente. Na Arábia Saudita, o governo mudou uma lei que exigia o consentimento de um homem para que uma mulher abrisse uma empresa. O feminismo tem se espalhando por vários lugares do mundo e há causas similares. Mas é preciso pensar nas diversas realidades enfrentadas pelas mulheres, inclusive no Brasil.

O feminismo brasileiro tem características específicas como a necessidade de pensar as diferentes perspectivas envolvendo gênero e, principalmente, raça, classe e sexualidade. É um dos debates mais atuais dentro do movimento. “Ser branca em São Paulo é diferente de ser negra e nordestina”, diz Mafoane Odara, coordenadora de projetos do Instituto Avon. Diretora executiva da Anistia Internacional e fundadora da ONG Criola, Jurema Werneck aponta que o feminismo clássico trata da mulher branca de classe média, mas há outras questões que precisam ser mais debatidas. “O movimento ainda precisa ver como lidar com a maioria das mulheres, e isso inclui negras, trans, entre outros grupos”, afirma. Ela complementa: “Não digo que as pautas não ressoem, nem estou negligenciando reivindicações, mas é preciso retornar aos princípios do próprio feminismo de igualdade e justiça e ter olhar mais amplo.” Integrante da Marcha das Mulheres Negras de São Paulo, Juliana Gonçalves afirma que hoje o correto é falar sobre feminismos, no plural, e sobre como os grupos estão se articulando. “As sufragistas e a queima dos sutiãs são sempre lembradas, mas a resistência começou bem antes”, diz. “Enquanto as mulheres brancas estavam batalhando para entrar no mercado de trabalho, minhas ancestrais já trabalhavam há muito tempo.” Gonçalves ressalta que respeitar diferenças não pode ser motriz de desigualdade ou separação. Pelo contrário, é o que dá mais força. “Mas é preciso escuta. Quem tem uma bagagem diferente não pode ser tratada como uma desigual, pois a intolerância se traduz em números que matam e ferem.”

No caso de mulheres negras, que representam um quarto da população brasileira, a sobreposição entre desigualdade de gênero e de raça resulta em números alarmantes. O Mapa da Violência 2015 mostra que a taxa de homicídios entre negras aumentou 54,2% entre 2003 e 2013. No mesmo período, a taxa entre brancas caiu em 9,8% (confira no quadro ao lado). Além disso, é o perfil social com os maiores índices de desemprego: 17,4% contra 11,6% da média feminina com ensino médio. Resistência do mercado de trabalho e violência constante são realidades também para transexuais e travestis, em um País com as mais altas taxas de assassinatos desse grupo no mundo. Em 2016, aconteceu uma morte a cada dois dias. Diante desses dados e com a popularização do feminismo, discute-se atualmente a necessidade de olhar para as diferentes questões e se unir para combatê-los. “Essas outras vertentes surgem como forma de forçar o feminismo mais hegemônico a repensar suas práticas e perspectivas, se não a luta só serve para garantir igualdade a um segmento muito específico de mulheres”, afirma a escritora e militante feminista trans Amara Moira.

Foi ao perceber a dificuldade de mulheres negras no mercado de trabalho que a empresária e coach Ana Bernardes teve a ideia de se dedicar a ajudá-las. Criou o grupo Afro Empoderadas e Empreendedoras, hoje com mais de 2 mil pessoas, e presta consultoria empresarial voluntária, em eventos e acompanhamento individual — como faz com a dentista Kátia Cristina da Silva Neves, que gere seu próprio consultório. “Percebi que somos nós por nós”, diz Bernardes. Para a promotora de Justiça Fabiana Dal’Mas Rocha Paes, especialista em disparidades de gênero, a luta pela igualdade de oportunidades é justificada pelo efeito positivo também no desenvolvimento econômico. “Contemplar a parcela feminina da população, mais de 50%, fará com que o País seja mais desenvolvido”, afirma. “Por isso, podemos dizer que ser feminista e exigir mais espaços e oportunidades para as mulheres não tem a ver com ideologia ou tendência política para a esquerda ou direita, é uma questão, inclusive, econômica”, diz. Paes ressalta que, no último relatório do Fórum Econômico Mundial sobre disparidades de gênero, o Brasil caiu da posição 79 para a 90. “Essa queda tem relação com a falta de mulheres em cargos de poder”. E isso inclui o ambiente político. “Com mais mulheres no Congresso, haveria mais medidas protetivas”, afirma. Na Câmara dos Deputados, elas ocupam 10,7% das cadeiras e, no Senado, 14,8%.

O feminismo tem fomentado também mudanças no cotidiano dos brasileiros. A exemplo da discussão sobre a diferença entre assédio e paquera, que ficou mais intensa no início de 2018, quando a apresentadora americana Oprah Winfrey fez um discurso no Globo de Ouro falando sobre as situações vividas por mulheres na indústria do audiovisual em Hollywood. Na sequência, 100 francesas assinaram uma carta falando sobre o direito do homem de importunar uma mulher. Quais os limites da interação durante um flerte? O que é considerado ofensivo? Perguntas que muitas pessoas se fizeram podem ter sido respondidas durante o Carnaval deste ano, época em que os casos de violência sexual chegam a aumentar em 90%. Durante a folia, em diferentes cidades, foram distribuídos adesivos e cartazes com a frase “não é não”. Vídeos se propagaram pelas redes sociais com dizeres como “depois do não, tudo é assédio” e “meu corpo não é folia”, marcas de cerveja investiram em publicidade se posicionando contra abusos, cantores em blocos e trios elétricos lembraram a todo momento que violência contra a mulher é crime. E mais uma vez mulheres se organizaram com a campanha “Aconteceu no Carnaval”, site que recebe relatos dos abusos sofridos.

“Exigir mais espaços e oportunidades para as mulheres não tem a ver com ideologia” Fabiana Dal’Mas Rocha Paes, promotora de Justiça

No ambiente de trabalho, assédios também não são mais vistos com naturalidade. Nas empresas e instituições, mulheres têm se organizado para discutir situações e apontar nomes, inclusive expondo situações nas redes sociais. Um caso emblemático no Brasil envolve o ministério que é sinônimo da diplomacia: o Itamaraty, que registra casos recorrentes de embaixadores assediando sexualmente as funcionárias sem receber punição. “O fato de não haver mulheres na alta cúpula explica como um assediador pode ocupar o mesmo cargo até hoje, pois há apoio de chefes”, afirma uma integrante do Grupo de Mulheres Diplomatas, que falou à ISTOÉ sob anonimato. Para mudar esse cenário, é preciso que haja também envolvimento dos homens.

“Eles precisam entender a necessidade de abrir um espaço que é nosso mas que não estamos ocupando”, afirma a promotora Gabriela Manssur, autora do projeto Tempo de Despertar, curso voltado para explicar a agressores de mulheres a gravidade do crime e evitar que voltem a cometê-lo.

Manifestações, campanhas, protestos, grupos, apoios. As redes de mulheres crescem e mostram o caminho que o feminismo brasileiro deve seguir nos próximos anos. A advogada Najara Barreto, 37 anos, é um exemplo de como uma ajuda pontual pode se expandir para o coletivo. Espancada pelo marido, não via a possibilidade de se separar por não trabalhar e ter que cuidar dos filhos. Com a ajuda do projeto Justiça de Saia, da promotora Gabriela Manssur, que auxilia vítimas de violência doméstica, conseguiu um emprego, se separou e hoje trabalha na equipe de Manssur. “Passo meu celular pra quem quiser, converso com as mulheres pelo Whatsapp, dou apoio total. Depois do que passei e por ter conseguido me reerguer, quero fazer com que outras vítimas sejam salvas também”, diz. A projeção que o movimento feminista e de solidariedade tem ganhado pode acarretar, segundo Tiburi, em um avanço reacionário. “O feminismo vai ser combatido porque é inovador e transformador, porque garante liberdades individuais e é ultrademocrático. A lógica da história é essa”, diz. “O sistema social atual cria o medo: de denunciar em uma delegacia, de procurar ajuda, de se manifestar”, afirma Tiburi, que conclui: “Mas as mulheres perceberam que perderam espaço, que são violentadas, fisicamente e em sua dignidade, no seu corpo e no seu trabalho. E agora não há nada a perder com essa luta, que só vai crescer.”

demitiu Fernando Segovia do                   comando da Polícia Federal

(PF) na tarde desta terça-feira (27). O ex-diretor-geral será substituído por Rogério Galloro                  .

A demissão de                   Segovia

acontece depois de ele se envolver em polêmicas com a entrevista concedida à agência de notícias Reuters, em que comentou que o inquérito que investiga o presidente Michel Temer (MDB) poderia ser arquivado, e ainda sugeriu que o delegado responsável pelo caso corria o risco de ser punido. Desde então, o delegado enfrentou pressão para deixar o posto na PF.

Depois da fala polêmica, o                   então diretor-geral da Polícia Federal chegou a ser intimado pelo ministro do STF Luís Roberto Barroso para prestar esclarecimentos sobre o caso.

Barroso é relator no inquérito que investiga o presidente por suposto crime envolvendo a edição do                   Decreto dos Portos

, e considerou a declaração do delegado ""imprópria"". Em sua defesa, Segovia disse ter sido ""mal interpretado"", pontuando que ""e que o inquérito é conduzido por uma equipe de investigadores que atua ""com toda autonomia e isenção"".

Ontem,                   a procuradora-geral da República Raquel Dodge pediu para o Supremo que impedisse Segovia de comentar o inquérito

contra Temer. No pedido, a PGR requereu que o delegado se abstivesse de “qualquer ato de ingerência sobre a persecução penal em curso”, incluindo falar publicamente sobre as investigações, ainda sugerindo que ele fosse afastado do cargo caso respeitasse a determinação.

Quem assume o cargo a partir de hoje é                   Rogério Galloro

, que estava no comando da Secretaria Nacional de Justiça desde o fim do ano passado, nomeado pelo ministro da Justiça Torquato Jardim. Inclusive, quando da posse de Segovia na Polícia Federal, o nome mais cotado pelo ministro era justamente o de Galloro.

Em entrevista publicada pela agência Reuters no dia 9 de fevereiro, o diretor-geral da PF criticou a qualidade das provas colhidas no âmbito das investigações sobre suposta vantagem indevida oferecida pela empresa Rodrimar, que opera o porto de Santos, ao presidente Michel Temer.

Leia também: Agência corrige asserção de Segovia sobre arquivamento de inquérito contra Temer

""Os indícios são muito frágeis, na realidade, de que haja ou que houve algum tipo de influência realmente, porque em tese o decreto não foi feito para beneficiar aquela empresa”, disse. ""Se houve corrupção ou ato de corrupção, não se tem notícia do benefício. O benefício não existiu. Não se fala e não se tem notícia ainda de dinheiro de corrupção, qual foi a ordem monetária, se é que houve, até agora não apareceu absolutamente nada que desse base de ter uma corrupção”, completou o delegado.

Fernando Segovia também afirmou que ainda há diligências a serem cumpridas no âmbito da investigação e disse acreditar que em até três meses a apuração será concluída. ""Tudo que for indício que possa reportar uma possibilidade que ache uma prova que sustente esse tipo de acusação a gente vai ter que checar. É muito mais uma checagem de tudo que a gente tem para que no final não dê um veredicto ‘olha checamos tudo e não tem nada’. ‘Ah, mas vocês checaram tudo mesmo?'. Sim, foi tudo verificado"", declarou o diretor-geral da PF, indicando a tendência de pedir o arquivamento do inquérito.

535,1,,"Acredito que, de todos os enfrentamentos por que uma pessoa passa, nesse período, a depressão vem a ser o mais difícil deles, por conta da incompreensão.

Nesses momentos, tenho a sensação de que surgem pessoas com aquela necessidade incrível de rotular quem está passando por um momento de luta, no caso, a depressão. Quando eu passei por essa fase, escutei o discurso cansado de que eu precisava ocupar a minha cabeça; também ouvi o tal “isso aí é falta de fé” e que, de certa forma, eu não estava confiando em Deus. Outras vezes, ouvia que eu não estava me ajudando e que “ah, você precisa se levantar dessa cama”, como se isso fosse tão simples.

Quantas e quantas vezes escutei falas que mais me afundaram do que propriamente me ajudaram. Eu já estava me amando de menos e todas essas frases, em tom de “ajuda”, na verdade faziam com que eu me achasse ainda mais o problema, afinal, tudo era tão simples aos olhos dos outros, mas tão doloroso e complicado aos meus olhos. Então, eu chegava à conclusão de que o problema estava comigo.

Cansei-me de tanto escutar a frase: “Existem pessoas em condições tão piores que a sua e você aí, com problemas pequenos e se entregando por tão pouco.” Claro, isso certamente me ajudou bastante (ironia). A verdade é que ninguém entendia o quanto era difícil sair do meu quarto, o quanto eu queria dormir para aliviar aquela dor e ver o tempo passar depressa. Aliás, eu sentia que o tempo não passava e a angústia fazia cada vez mais morada em mim.

E, embora isso tudo tenha acontecido um bom tempo atrás, é triste ver que esses discursos permeiam ainda os dias de hoje. Até quando as pessoas vão acreditar que ir ao psicólogo é coisa de louco? Sabe, eu tenho visto muita gente deixando de procurar ajuda por vergonha, por achar que quem precisa de um psicólogo é realmente louco – ideia totalmente errônea. Mas, que atire a primeira pedra quem não tem nada a melhorar, quem não tem angústias, conflitos e quem não precisa de mudança. Todos nós precisamos, o erro está em procurar ajuda apenas quando adoecemos.

Então, eu percebo que se fala tanto em depressão, mas pouco em empatia. Damos muita atenção às doenças do corpo, mas nos esquecemos da alma e da mente, como se não ter disposição para ir ao trabalho por conta da depressão fosse de fato encarado como preguiça. Não se leva em conta as noites sem dormir por conta da insônia, ou o excesso de sono causado pelos remédios, ou até mesmo a falta de energia.

De uma vez por todas, que fique bem claro que depressão não é frescura, depressão não é preguiça, não é desculpa, não é falta de fé e não tem nada a ver com religiosidade. Depressão é luta.

Por isso, eu partilho da ideia de que o mal do século não é a depressão, mas a falta de empatia. É a incompreensão de pessoas que soltam suas falas que mais doem do que curam, que mais machucam do que saram, que mais pesam do que aliviam, que mais empurram para o buraco do que ajudam alguém a sair dele. Afinal, incompreensão também mata.

540,1,,"É preciso considerar que, de fato, há discriminação e preconceito na sociedade contra grupos ou pessoas com características ou estilo de vida especiais. Todavia, os movimentos sociais e partidos políticos extremistas se aproveitam desta pauta legítima de justiça social para propósitos obscuros. Eles não desejam apaziguar os conflitos na sociedade, pelo contrário. Sua lógica para conquista do poder é criar mais antagonismos e conflitos sociais. A lógica perversa é sempre aguçar a divisão na sociedade em dois grupos opostos: opressor e oprimido. Na pedagogia, desenvolvem teorias para 'libertação' dos alunos da 'repressão' dos professores. No âmbito social, estimulam o antagonismo de negros contra brancos, mulheres contra homens, filhos contra pais, empregados contra patrões, pessoas humildes contra a 'elite'. A desobediência e o descumprimento da lei é estimulado como 'luta política'. Nesta leitura marxista, os direitos humanos são transformados em direito da minoria contra a maioria.

Devemos combater organizações ideológicas que usam o combate à discriminação e preconceito como pretexto para a conquista do poder político. Alegam agir em defesa de pessoas em situação de fragilidade social, mas na verdade são ideólogos marxistas, anarquistas e pedófilos que pretendem impor seus valores e programas sem discussão democrática.

Quando sofrem oposição em suas propostas radicais de revolução cultural, se valem do pretexto de defesa dos direitos humanos de minorias, para acusar seus opositores de homofobia, racismo, machismo, e por aí vai. Em nome dos direitos humanos tudo podem! Por esta razão, inclusive, é que ao mesmo tempo em que são capazes de propor a 'mudança de sexo' para crianças, pretendem criminalizar as opiniões contrárias ao seu estilo de vida ou valores(4).

Quando os pedófilos defendem abertamente sua pretensão de manter relação sexual com crianças, podemos combater esta perversidade de forma democrática. Mas, quando a defesa da pedofilia é travestida em argumentos científicos, por juristas, psicólogos ou pedagogos, nos deparamos com uma manipulação. Porque agora, os pedófilos se escondem atrás dos direitos humanos, da pedagogia ou da psicologia, tornando suscetível de debate os mais sórdidos propósitos contra crianças e adolescentes. É sintomático que no julgamento do Supremo Tribunal Federal sobre a 'marcha da maconha', o relator da causa sugerisse que até mesmo pedófilos poderiam manifestar em praça pública seu desejo de fazer sexo com crianças!!(5)

O ciclo é completado na década de 90 pelas doutrinas do gênero – que propõe a ruptura entre o sexo biológico da criança e seu comportamento sexual – e a do gênero neutro – que propõe que até os 10 anos de idade a criança não tem 'sexo definido', e portanto, pode ser orientada livremente a comportar-se como homem ou mulher, independente do sexo biológico. A ""ideologia do gênero"", representa profunda violação à dignidade infantojuvenil. O primeiro passo é implantar nas mentes de adultos e crianças o falso entendimento de que a identidade sexual é construída por cada pessoa, desde a infância. O objetivo é realizar uma ruptura entre o sexo biológico e o comportamento ou opção sexual. Para alcançar este objetivo, propõe ensinar as crianças a romper os padrões culturais e sociais que fortalecem sua identidade biológica de sexo. Meninos poderiam ser chamados por nomes femininos ou se vestir como meninas, incentivando a troca de papéis sociais entre meninos e meninas. Para a perversa ideologia do gênero uma criança-travesti é uma 'conquista' da civilização moderna. E aqui encontramos o elo central de união entre o movimento pedófilo e o movimento gay: ambos propõem a autonomia de vontade (sexual) a crianças.

Esta estratégia está em plena implementação no Brasil, como vimos, especialmente em escolas de ensino básico. Projeto de lei no Congresso Nacional para autorizar a 'mudança de sexo' em crianças ou livros didáticos do MEC apresentando temas da sexualidade adulta para crianças, inclusive o direito ao prazer sexual, são apenas a ponta do iceberg desta estratégia política de erotização da infância. Fica muito evidente, assim, que estamos diante de um movimento político ideológico que utiliza os direitos humanos, especialmente a defesa de minorias e discriminados, como instrumento de ação política revolucionária. As minorias e discriminados são 'massa de manobra', um pretexto maquiavelicamente utilizado, para destruir valores e a cultura da maioria, especialmente a família monogâmica tradicional. (Engels, Heidegger e Marcuse)

A liberação do consumo de drogas também integra este arcabouço de ações fragmentadas que têm como alvo a infância e adolescência. As pesquisas revelam que os danos biológicos causados pelo consumo de drogas na infância ou adolescência são muito maiores, e que o principal resultado comportamental do consumo de drogas na adolescência é a desobediência (especialmente na família e escola) e a precoce iniciação sexual, inclusive por violência sexual.13

É claro que nenhum partido marxista pretende estatizar os meios de produção, embora se encontre tal impropério em seus estatutos. O alvo, agora, é abater a 'sociedade burguesa' em seu elo mais fraco: a família e as crianças. A ideia é destruir nossa cultura e valores morais. A legalização do consumo da maconha, da prostituição ou do 'direito' da criança ao prazer sexual (pedofilia) são exemplos de batalhas silenciosas desta trágica 'revolução', que não virá mais pelas armas, mas por meio de decisões do Supremo Tribunal Federal e de órgãos administrativos.

Estes estudiosos comunistas davam ênfase especial à influência da cultura e da psicologia como instrumento para a destruição da sociedade capitalista. Por esta razão, seu pensamento ficou conhecido como 'marxismo cultural'.

4 Em sua redação original, o projeto de lei nº 122/2006, da Câmara dos Deputados, determinava a prisão de até 3 anos para quem ""constrangesse política ou filosoficamente' um homossexual. Em outras palavras, pretende-se

criminalizar a conduta de discordar ou desagradar homossexual, por divergência de opinião política ou filosófica.

8 A lei da palmada é um exemplo claro desta estratégia ideológica de antagonizar filhos contra pais, e enfraquecer o poder familiar. Sua justificativa é justa – proteger crianças de castigos físicos – , mas na verdade, o objetivo é antagonizar filhos contra pais. Imaginem uma criança desagradada por restrições corretas impostas pelos pais, recebendo a informação de que pode obter benefícios denunciando-os a autoridades!

9 Esta absurda exposição midiática de abusos praticados por familiares, está levando até mesmo a propostas de suspeição de todas as famílias. Na Escócia, projeto de lei em análise no parlamento, prevê a designação de uma tutor legal para cada criança nascida, para representá-la contra seus pais, em caso de 'conflitos de interesse'. O nome do projeto é 'Named Person Bill'.

¹° Marcuse entende que a causa do surgimento da razão dominadora (logos grego) foi a família monogâmica tradicional. Ele propõe substituí-la por uma nova razão, que surgiria a partir da liberação sexual completa de crianças e adolescentes de qualquer tabu ou restrição a práticas sexuais. Assim, o incesto, a homossexualidade, a pedofilia e até a necrofilia seriam instrumentos para 'libertar' crianças e adolescentes da razão dominadora grega !!!

¹¹A Prefeitura de Recife-PE adotou livro didático infantil em que havia orientação expressa a práticas sexuais aos alunos, inclusive desenho de uma criança se masturbando. No município de Fernandópolis-SP foram apreendidos livros didáticos com o mesmo conteúdo erotizador da infância.

544,2,,"A new bill will allow U. S. drivers in Tennessee to hit protestors standing in their way and remain immune from prosecution – even if the protestors suffer injuries.

The Tennessee bill aims to address protesters who block traffic and cause a nuisance to drivers.

Senator Bill Ketron (R-Murfreesboro) introduced the bill and said in a statement, “We believe that citizens have the right to protest. There is a procedure for peaceful protests and the purpose of that process is to protect the safety of our citizens. Protestors have no right to be in the middle of the road or our highways for their own safety and the safety of the traveling public.”

Representative Matthew Hill (R–Jonesborough) sponsored the bill, and issued a statement saying, “We are not endorsing anyone running over a person with a car, whether it is protestors or anyone else. If someone intentionally harms a person, they are going to be charged with a crime, period. There is a clear difference, however, between peacefully protesting and lawless rioters in the middle of a public roadway who jeopardize the safety of our families. This is a public safety bill that is meant to protect everyone’s right to peacefully protest and I look forward to seeing this commonsense legislation passed into law.”

Katie Jacobs lives in Chattanooga was one of thousands who did the Women’s March on Washington.

“It’s part of being involved,” said Katie Jacobs. “It’s part of being a citizen.”

“Oh you’re protesting so it’s your fault if you get hurt,” said Jacobs. “I feel like that’s the attitude some people would take. And that’s not the direction we want to go in.”

Others share that concern. Asyja Pryor is with Concerned Citizens for Justice and attends rallies and protests in Chattanooga.

“I think that is is directly harmful for people who are trying to exercise their first amendment right,” said Asyja Pryor.

President of the Chattanooga Tea party Mark West says when he protested with his group – he never blocked traffic. For him, the bill comes down to law enforcement.

“It’s already a violation of the law to obstruct traffic and obstruct highways,” said Mark West. “When they’re doing that, we shouldn’t have citizens confront citizens. We should have law enforcement confront the violators of the law.”

The bill comes after Metro Nashville Police investigated claims of a man driving into protesters last month.

Safety is something – lawmakers and protesters – say needs to be at the forefront.

“No one wants lawless rioters in the street,” said Jacobs. “No one wants to see that kind of thing at all.”

545,1,,"Na Maré, ocupação militar custou o dobro dos gastos sociais nos últimos seis anos

Prefeitura investiu R$ 303,63 milhões na área, enquanto presença das tropas federais, em 15 meses, somou R$ 599,6 milhões

Em seis anos, os investimentos em programas sociais da Prefeitura do Rio foram pouco mais da metade dos gastos federais com a ocupação militar do complexo de favelas da Maré (zona norte), que durou 15 meses. Enquanto a atuação da Força de Pacificação – integrada por militares das Forças Armadas – custou R$ 599,6 milhões no período, o município investiu, desde 2009, R$ 303,63 milhões na área, dos quais R$ 69,98 em projetos já implantados.

O próprio Secretário Estadual de Segurança, José Mariano Beltrame, costuma dizer que a solução policial é a “ponta do iceberg” ou a “seta da flecha” e deve ser precedida por projetos sociais em áreas pobres. “O problema da violência urbana não é um problema único e exclusivo da polícia. Nunca se discute as causas da violência, e a polícia trabalha com a consequência. Se ficarmos com esse olhar estreito, míope, de que a polícia vai resolver tudo, esses problemas vão se prolongar por mais um tempo”, disse Beltrame na terça-feira passada, quando os militares deixaram a Maré.

O complexo é o 19º bairro com menor Índice de Desenvolvimento Social (IDS) entre os 160 do Rio, segundo o Censo de 2010 realizado pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE).

A Maré é um dos territórios incluídos no programa Rio Mais Social, parceria da prefeitura com a ONU-Habitat, dedicado a comunidades com Unidades de Polícia Pacificadora (UPPs). A previsão é que o conjunto de favelas receba quatro delas até o fim do primeiro trimestre de 2016. Entre os gastos previstos estão três novas Clínicas da Família e ampliação e construção de unidades educacionais, orçada em R$ 21 milhões. O projeto mais arrojado é o programa Fábrica de Escolas do Amanhã, com investimentos estimados em R$ 236 milhões para a construção de um campus educacional com oito escolas.

Entidades que atuam na região reclamam que a solução que vem sendo dada para a violência na Maré prioriza ações policiais, em detrimento das sociais. Para Eduardo Alves, um dos coordenadores da ONG Observatório de Favelas, “há a hegemonia de uma ação bélica nas soluções” encontradas pelo poder público para o complexo.

“Para a gente, o território de favela é um território de potência. É na favela, nas periferias, que, com pouco investimento, se inventa muita coisa. UPP não deveria ser unidade de polícia, deveria ser unidade de políticas públicas. Você não deveria começar um processo de mudança de um território com uma ação policial, uma ação bélica, uma ação ofensiva”, disse ele.

Para o professor Miguel Borba de Sá, do Instituto de Relações Internacionais da PUC-Rio e especialista em estratégias militares, desde a década de 80 do século passado “a única solução dos diferentes governos tem sido mais militarização, mais violência, mais recursos (para a Polícia)”. “É o aumento da militarização em uma região já muito militarizada e conflagrada que vai resolver o problema?”, pergunta.

Já a Força de Pacificação, ao encerrar suas atividades no conjunto de favelas, divulgou uma nota afirmando que a ocupação conseguiu reduzir a taxa anual de homicídios na área de 21,29 mortes por 100 mil habitantes para 5,33 mortes por 100 mil. “As ações das tropas federais foram pautadas pelos princípios da proporcionalidade e uso gradual da força (…) buscando evitar danos colaterais à população local”, diz o texto.

Amikor egy fasort lecserélnek, és a helyére ugyancsak fasor kerül – akkor józanabb reakció tudomásul venni, hogy ez bizony időről időre előforduló, szükséges beavatkozás.

Felvetődhet ellenérvként, hogy laikus szemmel egész más fa minősül kivágásra érettnek, mint ahogy ezt a szakértő megítéli. A saját kertünkben többnyire nem vágjuk ki azt a fát, aminek meg van repedve a törzse, vagy hullanak a korhadt ágai. Elvan az még ott évtizedekig, mondjuk, és ez pontosan így van. Csakhogy van egy fontos különbség: a saját kertünkben – vagy egy erdőben – sokkal kisebb az esélye, hogy pont tartózkodjon valaki a sérült, ingatag fa alatt, amikor a vihar megtépi vagy kifordítja a helyéről, mint egy zsúfolt nagyváros közepén. A közterületeken szigorúbbak a megtartási kritériumok, és sokszor olyan fáknak is menniük kell, amelyek egyébként tényleg eléldegélnének még egyideig, időnként elhullajtva egy vaskosabb ágat.

Néhány évvel ezelőtt hasonló dilemma állt elő a kerület másik, jellegzetesen árnyas és zöld utcájában, a Falk Miksa utcában. Ott a közterületfelújítás során az a döntés született, hogy megtartják a megtartható fákat, a kivágandók helyére pedig újakat ültetnek – ezzel nem mindenki értett a szakértők közül egyet, de a lakossági tiltakozástól tartva az önkormányzat ezt az utat látta járhatónak.

A Semmelweis utcát az V. kerületi önkormányzat hamarosan felújítja. Hasonló változásra kell számítani, mint a közeli Városház vagy a Vitkovics Mihály utcában: rendezettebb környezet és szegélyek, porfírkő díszburkolat a járdákon, középen megmaradó aszfaltos úttest. Nem nagyon bátor beavatkozások ezek, csak kicsit civilizáltabbá teszik a környezetet. A parkolóhelyek száma lényegében azonos marad a jelenlegivel, illetve kis mértékben csökken. A felújítás első lépéseként az önkormányzat megbízta a Főkert Zrt-t a fasor rekonstrukciójával. Ezt a fasort 2014-ben a Főkert már alaposan megvizsgálta, minden egyedét szemrevételezéssel és a leggyakrabban használt Fakopp 3D akusztikus diagnosztikai módszerrel szemügyre vettek, példányonként kockázatelemzést készítettek. Ennek anyaga hozzáférhető a neten – amit a fákról tudni lehet, az ebben a tanulmányban benne van. A fasort még abban az évben legallyazták, de ez nem jelentett végleges megoldást, csak az életveszély elhárítását szolgálta.A Semmelweis utcában 30-50 éves nyugati ostorfák állnak, amelyek a szűk és sötét utcában növekedve jelentősen felnyurgultak a napfény felé, és a házak miatt idővel egyre féloldalasabbakká váltak. A fák többsége erősen sérült, a koronák torzultak, a törzsek sérültek, repedtek vagy hasadoznak, nagyon sok fa erősen megdőlt az utca közepe felé, ami azzal fenyeget, hogy idővel rádőlnek a járókelőkre és az autókra.A vizsgálat azt állapította meg, hogy az utca 27 fájából 13 azonnali kivágásra érett, 10 darab ifjítással, sebkezeléssel, visszametszéssel még legfeljebb tíz évig megtartható, négy pedig jó állapotú. Vagyis a fasor felét mindenképpen cserélni kellene, és a maradék nagy részét körülbelül hat-hét év múlva kellene kivágni, van viszont négy olyan – fiatalabb – példány, ami még sokáig élhetne.

Ez teljesen érthető, két okból is: ez egy nagyon karakteres, szép fasor. A Kossuth Lajos utca felől benézve a házak között összeboruló, zöld alagutat alkotó fák sajátos hangulatot adnak az utcának, és Budapest belső részein ehhez hasonló látvány – és nyáron hűvösség, árnyék – nagyon kevés helyen akad. A másik ok, hogy valóban túl sok olyan beruházás történt az elmúlt években a városban, aminek a fák látták a kárát. A legpusztítóbbak ezek közül azok, ahol a fákat kifejezetten azért irtották ki, hogy egy épületnek vagy más lebetonozott felületnek csináljanak helyet, mint a Duna Aréna esetében. Erre nem nagyon van mentség.

Vagyis a fasor felét mindenképpen cserélni kellene, és a maradék nagy részét körülbelül hat-hét év múlva kellene kivágni, van viszont négy olyan – fiatalabb – példány, ami még sokáig élhetne.

Ez teljesen érthető, két okból is: ez egy nagyon karakteres, szép fasor. A Kossuth Lajos utca felől benézve a házak között összeboruló, zöld alagutat alkotó fák sajátos hangulatot adnak az utcának, és Budapest belső részein ehhez hasonló látvány – és nyáron hűvösség, árnyék – nagyon kevés helyen akad. A másik ok, hogy valóban túl sok olyan beruházás történt az elmúlt években a városban, aminek a fák látták a kárát. A legpusztítóbbak ezek közül azok, ahol a fákat kifejezetten azért irtották ki, hogy egy épületnek vagy más lebetonozott felületnek csináljanak helyet, mint a Duna Aréna esetében. Erre nem nagyon van mentség.

Fideszes médiaember: „Ki kell énekelnünk a németek kezéből az RTL Klubot”

Hiába a sok tízmilliárdos tőkeinjekció, az új kormányzati média csak ott hatékony, ahol nincsenek versenytársai.

Győzött a józan ész: nem lesz otromba teniszstadion a Margitszigeten!

Tegnap azt írtuk, jóvátehetetlen bűn, ami a Margitszigeten készül. Mára fordult a kocka.

Ha agyonütnek, akkor sem gondoltam volna, hogy a keresztény Európa értékei között fel kell sorolni, hogy nem eszünk rovart.

Ebből még baj lesz: nem mindenhol győztünk a politikai korrektség felett

Mint Asterix gall faluja, késői káeurópai kiadásban, úgy fogunk élni? És ki beszél ma nálunk a cigányság integrációjáról?

A monstrum 26 méter magas lesz, és kiemelt beruházásként valósul meg. Szegény Margitsziget.

Belvárosi fakivágás: nem kell riadót fújni, itt a magyarázat!

Szomorú, hogy a belváros egyik legszebb utcai fasorát ki kell vágni, de az újratelepítésnek eljött az ideje. Az igazi kérdés az, mennyi hely jut az utcákban a fáknak és mennyi az autóknak.

Két nappal ezelőtt még nem volt ott a beléptető kapu. Viszont a bólya az duplán egybe csúsztatva és nem a rendes műanyag féle, szóval beszorul a lökhárító alá úgy, hogy valami olyan hangja volt az autómnak mint egy zetor szóval közvetlenül azután, hogy megszereztem a parkoló jegyem, félre álltam elakadás jelzővel mert el se tudtam képzelni mifaxvan. Ekkor észleltem a kiszedhetetlen bólyát az autóm alatt, mintegy 10 percig előre hátra, hátha ki tudom onnan rugdalni úgy, hogy nem szakad le a kocsim eleje. Végül leintettem egy bácsit és valami baszott nagy szerencsém volt, ugyanis szerintem pont egy autószerelőt sikerült elcsípnem, aki előkapta az emelőt és segített nekem kibányászni azt a szart az autóm alól. Ezúton is hihetetlen hálás vagyok neki, annyira le voltam fagyva, hogy azt is elfelejtettem megkérdezni jövök e neki valamivel. Szóval a bólya para ezzel megoldódott, lepakoltam, bementünk és szépen meg is kérdeztem a vevőszolgálaton, hogy mi a faszom az a kapu lent, tekintve, hogy a világ legótvarabb tescojáról beszélünk és tudtommal még az aréna plázába se fizetős a tesco és a parkoló, közölte a nénike, hogy tesztelik a kapukat. Ekkor már már agyvérzés szélén voltam és gondoltam közlöm, hogy esetleg tesztelés végett helyeztek ki bólyákat a pakoló közvetlen lejáratába úgy, hogy sötétbe észre se veszed miközbe kanyarodsz le vagy csak szimpla szopatásból, de nem szeretek veszekedni főleg nem mikor ott a gyerkőc, szóval végül elengedtem a témát.

* The 29-year old actor-poet, shamed the “Umagang Kay Ganda” host.

In February 19 episode of Kapamilya morning show, “Umagang Kay Ganda,” news anchor Anthony Taberna made a controversial victim-blaming statement towards a gang-rape victim.

Famous spoken word poet Juan Miguel Severo expressed his dismay over the issue on Twitter.

“So in today’s episode of @ukgdos, Anthony Taberna decided to victim-blame a woman who was gang raped.

Oh, this man. I don’t think I’m alone in thinking na hindi nakagaganda ng umaga – at ng buhay! – ang mga ganitong tao sa TV. To quote Ang Larawan, “Paalam, Candida!” he wrote.

On his other tweet, Juan Miguel urged everyone to remove the boys-will-be-boys mindset on talking about rape issue.

“We deserve better than statements that normalize the boys-will-be-boys mindset. Rape doesn’t happen because victims put themselves in vulnerable situations, rape happens because rapists rape,” he continued.

Indeed, great power comes greater responsibility. As news personality, Anthony should be more careful about what he says on national TV as it might affect the mentality of her viewers.

The “boys-will-be-boys” mentality has to go!

572,4,,"O aprofundamento da crise econômica e a ausência de direção política local impôs uma medida ao governo federal que não terá efetividade, agravará a crise do Rio no médio prazo. O objetivo dessa medida não é resolver o problema, mas ganhar tempo. Não existem soluções de curto prazo para um estado conflagrado no nível em que se encontra o Rio de Janeiro. Diante da importância do estado na política nacional e da impossibilidade de manutenção de um governo central que perca completamente o controle do estado sede do grupo globo para a barbárie, Temer cartou alto: apresentou a proposta de intervenção militar na segurança pública do Rio.

A crise econômica nacional, a corrupção no governo do estado e na Petrobrás feriram profundamente a economia do Rio de Janeiro que apresenta índices de desemprego bastante superiores em relação ao resto do Brasil. Nos últimos três anos mais de meio milhão de postos de trabalho foram extintos, somente em 2017 foram 90 mil, um recorde nacional. O segundo estado foi Alagoas com o fechamento de 8,2 mil postos de trabalho. É possível sentir nas ruas a situação de colapso social e econômico com 14 mil moradores de rua, segundo dados oficiais, só na capital, três vezes mais que no ano de 2013.

A falência do projeto do PMDB e o aprofundamento da carestia, empurrou o estado para a pior crise de sua história. A vertiginosa decadência econômica, fruto de um pacto entre a lumpen-burguesia fluminense, de figuras como Eike Batista e Cavendish, com os governos do PMDB deixou o Rio na situação mais grave entre os estados da federação.

A insatisfação popular manifestada no carnaval nos desfiles da Tuiuti, Beija-Flor e Mangueira, associada ao sentimento de total caos social e criminalidade, seguramente acendeu a luz vermelha no Palácio do Planalto. A necessidade de imposição de uma “agenda positiva” e a pressão de setores da burguesia nacional — representados pela bancada da bala — juntamente com a rede Globo, devem ter contado pra decisão de intervenção militar na segurança pública do Rio de Janeiro.

Com tamanha crise econômica, é seguro afirmar que o varejo do trafico de drogas refluiu, impondo às diversas facções diversificação de suas atividades. O Rio de Janeiro é recordista em roubos de carga, em assassinatos de policiais e a violência é percebida com bastante intensidade nas ruas. Com a atuação de milícias e diversas facções atuando no tráfico de drogas, uma pactuação como já ocorreu nos moldes de São Paulo entre PCC e o governo do estado é algo absolutamente descartado. Além disso, o tráfico e a milícia são elementos de contenção na organização do povo pobre das favelas, a militarização generalizada da segurança pública do Rio de Janeiro será mais um elemento.

A intervenção militar na segurança do Rio de Janeiro não é novidade nas favelas cariocas. A favela da Maré já ficou ocupada por mais de um ano entre 2014 e 2015, operação que custou aos cofres públicos mais de 600 milhões de reais. A efetividade dessa medida foi zero, e com o tempo os militares passaram a cometer as mesmas violações de direitos praticadas por forças policiais. O tráfico nunca parou de operar no período da ocupação.

A crise profunda do Rio de Janeiro, e a potencial militarização da segurança pública do estado, ao mesmo tempo em que abre um momento distinto no processo de luta política, impõe ao PSOL carioca a luta pelo poder no segundo estado da federação. O colapso dos políticos da ordem impõe como tarefa ainda mais urgente a luta pelo poder não só institucional, mas em organização e associação íntima com o povo do Rio de Janeiro, muito mais profunda do que foi ate agora. Disputando com a direita, que com a militarização da segurança pública do estado pode ganhar mais força no curto prazo, e com o PMDB, a máfia que no Rio colapsou mas que nacionalmente segue sustentando o governo Pezão. É necessário lutar pela construção de canal democrático junto ao povo, associações de moradores, bairros, juventude, trabalhadores e servidores do estado elaborando um programa para dar resposta à crise. Para isso o PSOL-RJ deve assumir a palavra de ordem de antecipação das eleições para governo do estado pelas condições especialmente graves do Rio de Janeiro. Não é possível admitir que a máfia que causou toda essa crise siga no governo. É inviável ter segurança pública enquanto parte da pior organização criminosa do estado, o PMDB, estiver no aparelho estatal.

574,1,,"O OpenDNS, serviço de DNS gratuito da Cisco, ganhou uma novidade importante para usuários brasileiros: a empresa inaugurou servidores no país, reduzindo significativamente a latência na resolução de domínios.

Trata-se do primeiro servidor do OpenDNS na América do Sul, mais precisamente no datacenter da Equinix em Santana de Parnaíba (SP), conforme apurou o Tecnoblog. Até então, os usuários no Brasil eram direcionados para servidores em Miami, geograficamente mais próximo do país.

Nos nossos testes, o ping diminuiu bastante: até Miami, a latência em uma conexão da Vivo em São Paulo (SP) girava em torno de 130 a 140 milissegundos; com os servidores nacionais, o tempo caiu para 3 ms. Na prática, isso significa que os acessos a páginas da web poderão ficar sensivelmente mais rápidos.

O DNS tem a função de traduzir um endereço (tecnoblog.net) para um IP (104.25.134.33). Se o serviço for instável, o acesso a um site qualquer poderá ficar mais lento. Se o servidor de DNS estiver fora do ar, como aconteceu recentemente com o Google Public DNS, você terá dificuldade para acessar a web, mesmo quando sua conexão estiver normal.

Os servidores do OpenDNS continuam os mesmos: 208.67.222.222 e 208.67.220.220. Saiba como mudar o DNS no Windows e macOS e descubra qual é o mais apropriado para você.

Protests in Benghazi eventually led to the toppling of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

While many people say it has led to much change, ongoing political division is still taking its toll on the lives of many Libyans.

595,1,,"BOA VISTA - Uma fila com 300 imigrantes venezuelanos se forma na lateral da praça Simón Bolivar, na região central de Boa Vista, capital de Roraima, em busca de um frasco de canja de galinha. São 22h30 horas de quinta-feira, dia 15. A comida acaba. Quem conseguiu uma porção da refeição de menos de 300 gramas, distribuída por uma ONG chamada SOS Venezuela, divide a comida com os demais conterrâneos que estão no final da fila. Uma oração de agradecimento ao povo brasileiro, puxada por um pastor refugiado, serve como sinal de que chegou a hora de ir dormir.

Segundo dados da prefeitura de Boa Vista, a cada dia 1,2 mil venezuelanos entram em Roraima. Somados, os quatro alojamentos providenciados pelo governo local não têm capacidade para abrir esta quantidade de gente. E já estão superlotados. Sem abrigo, a única solução para os refugiados é dormir nas praças ou em moradias improvisadas às margens das rodovias. É mínima a parcela dos refugiados que consegue vaga em alojamento. “Esse número foge completamente à nossa capacidade de atendimento”, admite, em nota, a prefeitura da capital de Roraima.

Na Praça Simón Bolívar, é extremamente precária a situação de moradia dos cerca de 500 venezuelanos que passaram a viver ali. Poucos contam com barracas para se proteger da chuva, do sol e do sereno noturno. O refugiado Javier Ronce, de 47 anos, reclama do descaso do governo brasileiro com os imigrantes que vivem nas ruas de Boa Vista. Formado em turismo pela Universidade Central da Venezuela, domina três línguas diferentes e tem no currículo trabalhos prestados para grandes empresas do país vizinho.

— A mesma fome que estávamos passando na Venezuela estamos passando agora aqui no Brasil. Por que o governo brasileiro não fecha a fronteira logo? — questiona Ronce.

O venezuelano, assim como as demais lideranças do acampamento, alegam que não recebem qualquer apoio do governo brasileiro ou do estado de Roraima para alimentar suas famílias ou obter meios para conseguir vagas em abrigos.

— A única ajuda que recebemos aqui é das igrejas. Se o Brasil faz questão de dizer que está recebendo os refugiados venezuelanos, que dê condições mínimas para a gente sobreviver. E não deixe nossas crianças passando fome dormindo na praça — desabafa.

Uma das coordenadoras da SOS Venezuela, Kamila Dantas, de 29 anos, afirma que, com a ajuda de doações de igrejas da capital de Roraima, seu grupo consegue servir até 500 refeições por dia, às terças e quintas-feiras.

— Nos demais dias da semana ou as pessoas ficam com fome ou contam com outros grupos que vêm prestar ajuda — diz Kamila.

Percorrendo as ruas de Boa Vista, não se anda mais de 10 minutos sem encontrar um grupo acampado em frente a prédios públicos ou perto de sinais de trânsito, onde muitos conseguem arrecadar alguns trocados para a subsistência. As necessidades fisiológicas são feitas em terrenos baldios.

O maior alojamento de venezuelanos, montado no ginásio de esportes Tancredo Neves, conta hoje com 700 pessoas. Das três alas do alojamento, apenas uma (onde se amontoam cerca de 300 pessoas) é coberta. Os demais 400 imigrantes dormem em pequenas barracas, em terrenos que ladeiam o ginásio de esportes.

As alas 2 e 3 não têm acesso à água potável. Os banheiros estão inutilizáveis há mais de uma semana, e as necessidades fisiológicas são feitas a céu aberto, onde brincam as cerca de 60 crianças que vivem no alojamento.

— Quando fala para um refugiado que surgiu uma vaga no alojamento do Tancredo, as pessoas ficam com medo. Aqui é um terror, um pesadelo — afirma um voluntário da Defesa Civil, que pediu para não ser identificado.

O capitão do Corpo de Bombeiros venezuelano, Cesar Medrano Mendez, classifica o acampamento como uma “bomba relógio”. Não é para menos. Apesar de equipes de cinco policiais militares, armados com escopetas, fazerem durante 24 horas por dia o patrulhamento do local, as brigas por comida e disputas de todas as ordens —inclusive por melhor espaço para seu barraco — são frequentes. Uma delas aconteceu na frente da equipe de reportagem. A polícia interveio, e os ânimos se serenaram.

598,1,,"DOHA: The inspectors of the General Authority of Customs seized about 28kg of hashish and marijuana drugs in collaboration with Jinah Al Athar section of the Ministry of Interior at Hamad International Airport (HIA).

The seizure includes 22.7kg of hashish and 5kg of marijuana, said a release. Six employees from Customs Department of HIA involved in the seizure were awarded by Ahmad bin Abdullah Al Jamal, Director of the General Authority of Customs, for their efforts in foiling the attempt of smuggling this large quantity of drugs.

“The Authority has been warning to those attempting to harm the country by carrying such substances as customs officials are keeping an eye on such activities,” said Al Jamal.

He said that the Authority is running special training programme to boost the capability of inspectors in disclosing suspected items and catching the materials that are banned in the country.

The seizure was made from three passengers coming from an Asian country on a direct flight to Qatar. The drug traffickers had placed drugs in four packets weighing 8kg, 6.5kg, 4.7kg and 3.5kg. All packets were hidden in the bags.

A customs official conducted inspection of a suspected passenger in coordination with rapid mobile customs section to follow up remaining passengers, seized their bags after inspection and took out the banned materials.

Jinah Al Athar section of the Ministry of Interior seized a bag in cooperation with customs. The bag was containing part of seized consignments of Hashish.

Marijuana consignment was seized by a lady custom official from a suspected passenger who had hidden 5kg drugs in two bags. The drugs were seized and the case was registered in coordination with authorities concerned to complete further legal process.

Ahmad bin Abdullah Al Jamal, Director of the General Authority, appreciated the customs officials for their alertness in catching all consignments that were placed in several bags in same flights. Al Jamal thanked especially to lady customs officials for their excellent job in catching the banned substances attempted by the traffickers to carry to the country.

600,1,,"How is it that White Night's attendance figures have continued to grow and yet the crowds seem to be more manageable?

It's because Melbourne is White Nighting smarter. Over the years organisers have worked to manage the flow of punters away from those bottlenecks at Flinders and Swanston streets, with key attractions strategically spread across the city and surrounding precincts.

""Last year we had a lot of messaging about having people start their journeys north and south in the parklands,"" says artistic director David Atkins.

This year's key message? ""More of the same.""

Emphasising the attractions at Carlton Gardens worked so well last year that visitation to the precinct almost doubled. For White Night 2018 this Saturday, they've upped the ante again, adding more artworks at Carlton as well as at the Alexandra and Queen Victoria Gardens across the Yarra. ""This year they'll be bigger and better again,"" says Atkins.

The parks are also the most family friendly sections, he says, with the ""post-midnight"" crowd likely to congregate around the street-party vibe of the CBD where Verandah Virtuosos – musicians using balconies as their stages – and Queens on Collins – a drag extravaganza running in conjunction with Priscilla Queen of the Desert: The Musical – will be in full swing.

""For families and all the people who want to come in the beginning of the night, my advice to them is start in the gardens,"" says Atkins.

Another clever curatorial trick has been to include, amid all the spectacle, some works designed for quieter contemplation.

""We want people to experience this fantastic mixture of being uplifted and entertained but also provoking thought,"" says Atkins.

Underlining this year's theme, questions beginning with ""What if ...?"" will pop up at various locations on the hour, including at Flinders Street Station, inviting passers by to let their imaginations run wild.

At Hamer Hall, the Buddhist Tara Institute will guide visitors through a three-minute meditation every hour next to a giant painting of Tara the Liberator; plus you can get crafty making paper flowers until midnight.

At NGV International, candles will float vigil-like in the fountain (and also along paths at nearby Queen Victoria Gardens); asylum seekers telling stories of detention will be projected on the gallery facade (They Cannot Take the Sky).

One new attraction this year is the use of eye-popping 3D projection technology.

Hungarian-based Limelight Projection Mapping has mapped the entire southern facade of the Royal Exhibition Building in Carlton Gardens. Instead of projecting flat onto the building as if it were a cinema screen, there will be a dozen or so projectors lighting up every dark nook and cranny of the facade, from various angles.

""One of the easiest ways to explain the difference is that it's like watching a movie in 2D and then watching it in 3D – except you don't need the glasses,"" says Atkins.

Don't miss these stand-out artworks across the city.

What If...: Responding directly to this year's theme, this is your chance to see 3D projections in action on a grand scale at the Royal Exhibition Building.

The Serpent Mother: Everyone loves a bit of pyrotechnics at White Night. Watch this giant sculpture spurt fire at Melbourne Museum Plaza.

The Secret Life of Books: The always-popular State Library reading room transforms into an imagining of what those tomes get up to when nobody's watching.

Wish Tree: Described as a ""lo-fi"" snapchat, use your phone to write a wish or message on the leaves of this tree in the QV courtyard. It won't last forever!

Snow Lane: Think the Prince-inspired Purple Rain installation from White Nights past - but replace the rain with snow, snow, snow in Little Bourke Street.

Queens on Collins: Catch drag performances on multiple stages along Collins Street. At 10:25pm, 10:45pm and 11:05pm the cast of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert: The Musical will make special appearances at the steps of the Regent Theatre.

Liquid Sky: A shimmering, moving sculpture hovering in the air. We say it's a must-see but it will actually stay in Federation Square for two weeks after White Night.

Ava V2: In the astronomically themed Alexandra Gardens a semi-transparent, half-submerged sphere is brought to life with mind-bending 360-degree projections.

Shop at Myer, David Jones and Emporium until 9pm. If you're looking for a midnight snack, there will be food trucks at Carlton Gardens, Russell Street, Bourke Street, Collins Street, Birrarung Marr and Alexandra Gardens. A number of CBD restaurants and bars will also be open extra late.

You've checked the weather forecast and charged your phone. Now what?

For families: Take a picnic to Carlton, Alexandra or Queen Victoria Gardens, spread out on the grass and watch the attractions light up as the sun sets.

For the crowd-shy: Set an alarm and head into town in the wee hours when the crowds have dissipated. If you head into town on Friday at nightfall you might catch test runs of some of the exhibits at Carlton Gardens.

For serious art-lovers: Those intent on seeing as much of the limited-time-only attractions as they can should come armed with a map, a plan, a sense of purpose and the most sensible shoes they own.

White Night runs from 7pm to 7am on Saturday.

Então, você vai ser pai. Você sabe que precisa comprar uma casa maior. Tem que ter mais espaço pra criança. Tem que ter mais um quarto no apartamento. Tem que ter um berço novo, não pode ser aquele que a vizinha se dispôs a emprestar. Então você sabe que tem que trocar de carro, com seis airbags, no mínimo, ar-condicionado de fábrica. O que o humorista Marcos Piangers descobriu ao ser pai jovem é que essas preocupações não fazem diferença nenhuma. O que vale mesmo não é pagar pela melhor creche, se você é o último a buscar seus filhos. Não é comprar os melhores brinquedos, porque as crianças gostam mesmo é das brincadeiras que não custam nada. No fundo, o que importa mesmo, como os textos divertidos e emocionantes de Papai é Pop mostram, é você estar com seus filhos, não pensando em outra coisa, mas estar lá. De verdade.

618,1,,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the killing of 41 Nigerians in Zamfara State and urged Nigerians to join forces in praying for the nation.

The party made the condemnation in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan on Saturday.

Mr. Ologbondiyan urged the All Progressives Congress (APC)-controlled Federal Government to take decisive steps to end the incessant killings in various parts of the country.

He said it was heartbreaking that Nigerians were daily slaughtered by marauders.

“In the last two months, hundreds of helpless citizens have been murdered by bandits in various parts of the country.

“Hardly have tears dried over the gruesome killings in Benue, Taraba, Kaduna, Nasarawa and other states when marauders hit Zamfara, a state known for peace, killing 41 citizens in cold blood.

“Nigerians now live defenceless and in perpetual fear; our people are fast losing confidence in our institutions.

“As we speak, citizens are now sourcing their own security as APC-controlled Federal Government daily manifest crass indifference to the protection of our people,’’ Mr. Ologbondiyan alleged.

He said that the PDP stood with all citizens across the nation and share in their pains at this critical time.

The party spokesman called on all Nigerians, irrespective of their religion, ethnicity and political affiliation, as well as all people of goodwill across the world, to join forces in praying for the nation.

He also urged Nigerians to support the government and one another at what he described as critical time of the nation.

“We call on the APC-controlled Federal Government to seek help from Nigerians who can assist in our current situation.

“Our people have witnessed enough bloodletting and we must collectively find an end to the carnage.

“The PDP commiserates with the families of those killed in Zamfara and other states and pray God to grant us peace and all round protection in our country,’’ Mr. Ologbondiyan said.

619,1,,"Bigwigs in a more than 600-year-old South American population were easy to spot. Their artificially elongated, teardrop-shaped heads screamed prestige, a new study finds.

During the 300 years before the Incas’ arrival in 1450, intentional head shaping among prominent members of the Collagua ethnic community in Peru increasingly centered on a stretched-out look, says bioarchaeologist Matthew Velasco of Cornell University. Having long, narrow noggins cemented bonds among members of a power elite — a unity that may have helped pave a relatively peaceful incorporation into the Incan Empire, Velasco proposes in the February Current Anthropology.

“Increasingly uniform head shapes may have encouraged a collective identity and political unity among Collagua elites,” Velasco says. These Collagua leaders may have negotiated ways to coexist with the encroaching Inca rather than fight them, he speculates. But the fate of the Collaguas and a neighboring population, the Cavanas, remains hazy. Those populations lived during a conflict-ridden time — after the collapse of two major Andean societies around 1100 (SN: 8/1/09, p. 16) and before the expansion of the Inca Empire starting in the 15th century.

For at least the past several thousand years, human groups in various parts of the world have intentionally modified skull shapes by wrapping infants’ heads with cloth or binding the head between two pieces of wood (SN: 4/29/17, p. 18). Researchers generally assume that this practice signified membership in ethnic or kin groups, or perhaps social rank.

The Callagua people lived in Colca Valley in southeastern Peru and raised alpaca for wool. By tracking Collagua skull shapes over 300 years, Velasco found that elongated skulls became increasingly linked to high social status. By the 1300s, for instance, Collagua women with deliberately distended heads suffered much less skull damage from physical attacks than other females did, he reports. Chemical analyses of bones indicates that long-headed women ate a particularly wide variety of foods.

Until now, knowledge of head-shaping practices in ancient Peru primarily came from Spanish accounts written in the 1500s. Those documents referred to tall, thin heads among Collaguas and wide, long heads among Cavanas, implying that a single shape had always characterized each group.

“Velasco has discovered that the practice of cranial modification was much more dynamic over time and across social [groups],” says bioarchaeologist Deborah Blom of the University of Vermont in Burlington.

Velasco examined 211 skulls of mummified humans interred in either of two Collagua cemeteries. Burial structures built against a cliff face were probably reserved for high-ranking individuals, whereas common burial grounds in several caves and under nearby rocky overhangs belonged to regular folk.

Radiocarbon analyses of 13 bone and sediment samples allowed Velasco to sort Collagua skulls into early and late pre-Inca groups. A total of 97 skulls, including all 76 found in common burial grounds, belonged to the early group, which dated to between 1150 and 1300. Among these skulls, 38 — or about 39 percent — had been intentionally modified. Head shapes included sharply and slightly elongated forms as well as skulls compressed into wide, squat configurations.

Of the 14 skulls with extreme elongation, 13 came from low-ranking individuals, a pattern that might suggest regular folk first adopted elongated head shapes. But with only 21 skulls from elites, the finding may underestimate the early frequency of elongated heads among the high-status crowd. Various local groups may have adopted their own styles of head modification at that time, Velasco suggests.

In contrast, among 114 skulls from elite burial sites in the late pre-Inca period, dating to between 1300 and 1450, 84 — or about 74 percent — displayed altered shapes. A large majority of those modified skulls — about 64 percent — were sharply elongated. Shortly before the Incas’ arrival, prominent Collaguas embraced an elongated style as their preferred head shape, Velasco says. No skeletal evidence has been found to determine whether low-ranking individuals also adopted elongated skulls as a signature look in the late pre-Inca period.

620,1,,"Jaký byl vztah českých zemí a islámského světa?

Kontakty jsou prokázané už v raném středověku. V umění Velké Moravy nacházíme jasně patrné vlivy íránského umění, zdá se, že se nejednalo o výjimku, například na dvoře andaluského vládce se běžně vědělo, že existuje nějaká slovanská země. Ve vrcholném středověku se staly módou poutě do svaté země. Zajímavým svědectvím z pozdního středověku je spis Martina Kabátníka, který byl pod obojí a tuto pouť vykonal. Muslimy popisuje celkem objektivně. Zaujalo ho například, že nenutili k násilné konverzi a přijímali pouze dobrovolné konvertity.

Obeznámenost s koránem byla obecně v učeneckých kruzích značná. Například Jan Hus evidentně korán četl, protože na něj odkazuje. Sice ho jako celek z hlediska křesťanského duchovního odsuzuje, ale zmiňuje se třeba, že zbožnost některých muslimů by mohla být vzorem i pro křesťanské věřící. Když začaly války s Turky, tak odkazy na islám začaly být silně negativní. Radikálním bojovníkem proti islámu byl šlechtic Václav Budovec z Budova. Napsal knihu, část jejího názvu je Antialkorán, to jest Mocní a nepřemožení důvodové toho, že Alkorán turecký z ďábla pošel. Pikantní je, že když později čeští stavové vyhodili místodržící z oken a hledali spojence proti Habsburkům, tak se obrátili i na tureckého sultána. Když pak sultán poslal poselstvo, tak ho po Pražském hradě neprovázel a netlumočil mu nikdo jiný než odpůrce Turků Václav Budovec. Můžeme to brát jako důkaz, že politici se už v 17. století vyznačovali velmi pružnou páteří.

622,1,,"A intervenção no Rio de Janeiro esvazia a candidatura de Jair Bolsonaro e pode fortalecer a de Geraldo Alckmin. Essa é a leitura que faz o antropólogo Luiz Eduardo Soares, secretário nacional de Segurança no governo Lula, da medida anunciada hoje por Michel Temer.

Em entrevista exclusiva ao TUTAMÉIA, Soares afirma que o decreto não vai resolver o problema da segurança no Estado e tem objetivos políticos e midiáticos.

“É uma intervenção para eleitor ver. Para baixar a temperatura e criar um consenso mínimo, valorizando as Forças Armadas. É a bandeira da lei e ordem. Quem navegar com essa bandeira tende a prosperar. Mas não será um bolsonaro da vida. Porque, quando o Exército está presente, o capitão é marginalizado”, diz.

Na sua avaliação, “essa intervenção no Rio esvazia Bolsonaro e abre espaço para candidaturas que sejam capazes de colher o que Bolsonaro está semeando”.

E acrescenta: “Vejo potencial muito grande de fortalecimento de uma candidatura do tipo [Geraldo] Alckmin. Ele vai passar olimpicamente ao largo da intervenção, mas vai se beneficiar do esvaziamento de Bolsonaro. O Exército, de certa maneira, vai dizer para a população: ‘Se vocês querem falar a sério, falem com um general, não com um capitão’. Na medida em que o clamor do discurso do Bolsonaro é atendido na prática, entre aspas, ainda que de forma moderada, ele perde discurso. Em vez de um aventureiro de direita, vamos ter a solidez e a consistência do poder militar mostrando como se pode operar. Isso certamente esvazia Bolsonaro. E cria um espaço nacional, uma avenida para que essa candidatura de centro conservadora atraia esses votos e se fortaleça”.

Avaliando a intervenção no Rio dentro do contexto do governo golpista e ilegítimo, Soares declara que o objetivo do movimento de agora é “tentar buscar legitimidade na marra, na força e endossar o discurso bolsonariano sem Bolsonaro. É um bolsonarianismo sem Bolsonaro”.

Assim, na sua visão, o governo busca capitalizar o clamor protofascista existente na sociedade decretando uma medida que associa o governo federal com uma capacidade de enfrentamento à criminalidade”.

“Estamos criando espaço no Rio para alguma redução de sintoma até as eleições. Nesse ambiente pode prosperar uma candidatura que expresse esse discurso conservador, com alguma moderação. Não será extremista como Bolsonaro, mas que seja capaz de absorver os votos de Bolsonaro e desse tipo de ardor ideológico, apresentando-se como uma candidatura de centro. Mas abrindo perspectivas para fortalecimento futuro do grupo que provirá desse governo ilegítimo. Essa operação no Rio é também eleitoral. Daí pode emergir uma candidatura forte, até hoje inexistente, para o governo no Rio e talvez não apenas. Talvez não um capitão, mas um general ou similar”.

Apesar da manobra, o antropólogo não acredita na vitória de Alckmin. Ele afirma que a candidatura de Lula não está sepultada. E considera que, mesmo que Lula não venha a concorrer, “as forças democráticas progressistas serão capazes de oferecer uma candidatura vitoriosa. Mas a candidatura Alckmin me parece fortalecida por essa operação no Rio”.

“Para os conservadores pode ser uma solução no sentido político. Fortalece o governo federal, oferece uma possibilidade de unidade em torno de um certo discurso para a disputa eleitoral no Rio de Janeiro. Quem vai ser porta-voz que se manifesta na intervenção? Um general? Politico? Houve um deslocamento e há a emergência de um grande ator que são as Forças Armadas, o Exército, o general responsável”, diz.

Co-autor de “Elite da Tropa” (Objetiva, 2005), Soares declara que “o governo federal não está preocupado em resolver a questão da segurança pública”. Se estivesse preocupado, assinala, convocaria a sociedade, o congresso para discutir as mudanças profundas e estruturais. E deslocaria recursos para os mais pobres, em vez de pagar juros absurdos aos rentistas.

“Intervenção como essa, em ano eleitoral, de forma reativa, voluntarista, não dá conta disso”, diz. “Deixamos de enfrentar os grandes problemas e tratamos da crise em momento de emergência”.

Segundo ele, uma eventual redução de sintomas será magnificada pela grande mídia, e a percepção geral será de alívio num primeiro momento. Mas nada de fato consistente será feito para atacar o problema –o que envolveria amplas políticas sociais, culturais, educacionais, mudanças nas polícias, na equivocada política de encarceramento em massa, na legislação sobre drogas.

Soares, 63, alerta que as Forças Armadas não estão preparadas para enfrentar questões de segurança pública e teme que o movimento de agora possa ser a antessala de “uma degradação institucional como a que aconteceu no México”.

Internamente, as Forças Armadas devem ter uma reação muito negativa ao ato de Temer, ele avalia. Os militares “são inteligentes suficientemente para saber tudo que sabemos: não vai resolver o problema, não é o caminho. E, nesse ano eleitoral, cria, não só um precedente, mas um espaço que basicamente reforça o campo político ideológico do governo. É claro que eles estão vendo isso e não devem estar satisfeitos com a manipulação de que estão sendo objeto”.

E alerta para problemas no desenrolar da operação. “É quase impossível que não ocorram problemas na ponta. Quando morrer o primeiro civil, vamos ter um caso internacional. Para a imagem das Forças Armadas, isso é muito negativo”.

Na visão de Soares, nesse processo a negociação com a mídia será decisiva, já que a intervenção “é só aparência, sem consistência”, sem enfrentamento real dos problemas. “Se trata de ‘Jornal Nacional’. A operação militar é um problema editorial”.

623,1,,"While Colombian Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas said ""the number of Venezuelans who have participated in actions by the National Liberation Army (ELN) is growing,"" his Venezuelan counterpart Nestor Reverol, the Minister of the Interior and Justice, has condemned the Colombian army's attempt to recruit Venezuelans into their ranks.

On Friday, Reverol said: ""these actions aim to justify an interventionist action that would violate our (Venezuelan) national sovereignty.""

Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro announced Wednesday that he would coordinate a meeting between Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and Colombia's Foreign Ministry to discuss security issues for both countries.

Via Twitter, Maduro addressed Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos reminding him of their obligation to work for peace.

A day later, Colombian Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas confirmed in a press conference he held a telephone conversation with his Venezuelan counterpart, General Vladimir Padrino, and that they've agreed to coordinate security plans at the border. The date for this meeting was not announced.

""You @JuanManuelSantos as right-wing president & I as Bolivarian president are bound by history & our peoples to hear each other, communicate and work for Peace. There is no empire in the world that can undo the history that binds our peoples,"" Maduro said.

However, tension has been mounting between the two countries after Colombia's defense minister said intelligence agents found that an attack by the ELN carried out in late January was planned in Venezuela.

Shortly after, Venezuela’s interior and justice minister accused Colombia’s army of recruiting roughly 150 Venezuelans that could “create paramilitary groups highly indoctrinated with the capacity to move freely within Venezuelan territory.” Reverol ratified Maduro’s instructions to establish direct communication between the two nations defense ministers.

624,1,,"Food Without A Face began when I started the vegan transition 2 years ago.  I realised there was a definite lack of help for people who were looking to become plant based and so I started to develop an idea for an app that would give people directions to the nearest vegan friendly business no matter where they were in the world.

I've always loved food and I'm not a salad eating kind of person, so what really appeals to me are the foods that vegans would normally miss - scrambled ""eggs"", meat free bacon and burgers, chunky wraps and, most importantly, good coffee and cake!

With that in mind, having sampled a lot of what the area has to offer, I've noticed a distinct lack of vegan friendly businesses near where I live and along the coast of the North East of Scotland.

Recently I came across an absolutely beautiful old building called Collie Lodge in the coastal town of Banff, Aberdeenshire.  This would be my absolute dream location - close to the sea, excellent parking, very reasonable rent and a whole lot of potential to make this the best vegan cafe around!

This building goes to a closing date on the 28th February.  If this building slips away, there will be others and the money will be used to find one of those instead.  But this is just too perfect not to aim for!

So with this building in mind the money will go towards:

* Decorating!  The building has been used as a Tourist Information office for years and currently looks a lot like an old school classroom.  Out with the purple gloss paint and library shelves!

* Refit!  The food prep area and counter will be created from recycled materials

* Equipment! Coffee machines, panini makers, storage units and fridges are all needed to keep food in good shape

* Stock! All of the tasty vegan ingredients need to be bought in

* Rent!  For the first month or two the place will resemble a building site and won't be much use as a cafe so the money will go towards paying rent until the cafe can make it's own income

Aside from being the only vegan cafe for miles, FWAF will have several special features:

Eco Friendly Practices: electricity will be supplied by renewable energy companies; food will be served in recycled packaging that is also compostable; we will push for an electric car charging point in the car park and discount will be available to those driving electric vehicles; recycled plastic coffee cups will be sold that will discourage the use of disposable cups; recycling bins will be available in store

Vegan Comfort Food:  yes, there will be healthy options.  But my goal is to encourage EVERYONE to eat here, not just vegans!  In order to attract omnivores and show them just how great our food can be, there will be all sorts of tasty stuff available - maybe even some Cullen Skink!

Dog Friendly:  as a crazy dog lady, I absolutely 100% will encourage you ALL to bring your dog friends after your walks along Banff beach.  There will be snacks and water waiting for them!

Bird Friendly Coffee: as a place that promotes kindness to all living creatures, it would be wrong to ignore the impact that coffee farming has on our feathered friends.  With that in mind, all of our coffee will aim to come from companies that are certified Bird Friendly - coffee is grown in the shade, meaning that the combination of foliage cover, tree height and animal diversity provides suitable migratory bird habitat while maintaining productive farms. Producers must be recertified every three years to ensure they continue to meet these requirements and can truly call themselves Bird Friendly.

Creative Space For Hire: whether you run a camera club, an art group or even just want to meet here before heading out with your running group, the space will be available for people to hire for a small charge.

The aim for this coffee shop is to be unlike anything else in the area.  The interior will be relaxing and warm with upcycled furniture, comfy seating and lots of cool artwork by local artists.

There will be shelves of vegan friendly products that you can purchase to take home and we will also be running community events every now and again.

I can't believe I'm typing this, but after only 4 days we have raised £1008 - that's 1/5th of the total amount, which is AMAZING!!

With all of this excitement happening, now is the time to start sharing some of the ideas I have in mind for the products and decor.

The goal with this coffee shop is to make it warm, cosy, classy and somewhere people want to hang out for a little while and relax.  I'm a huge fan of comfy seats, dark walls and selective lighting.  The counter and any wooden tables will be made from recycled wooden pallets and scaffolding boards.  Walls will feature a lot of grey and accessories will be copper and wood to keep the warm theme going.

The floor underneath the carpets is uneven and desperately needs sanded so once that's done it will get a coat of stain to allow some of the natural beauty of the wood to shine through.  Seating will be around the edge where the windows are so customers can sit and enjoy the views.  There will be a socket with USB ports at each table so customers can charge their phones and make use of the free wifi.

There will be artwork from local artists adorning the walls and this will all be for sale if anything takes your fancy.

Products will be on display on shelves around the cafe and if there's anything you would like to request we order in, just let us know.  Things like dried soya, nutritional yeast, plant milks and other vegan staples will always be available.

I've been gathering some images to get a mood board going and you can see these if you click on UPDATES in the section above.  Any suggestions?  Get in touch!  I love hearing other people's ideas for the place!

Yes, It's Possible To Make A Vegan Omelet. Here's How

Vegan omelet seems like an oxymoron, but Rita Serano, author of the new Vegan in 7 cookbook, has figured out the secret ingredient: chickpea flour. In this genius recipe, she mixes the chickpea flour with water to create an omelet -like texture, then stuffs it with fresh herbs in the style of Persian staple Kuku Sabzi.

Kuku (pronounced koo-koo) is a savory Iranian omelet. The word sabzi refers to the large amount of herbs used, which makes this a beautifully green and very tasty way to start the day. Chickpea flour is a perfect egg substitute, and the amount makes four individual omelets.

Non-dairy yogurt (we love Kite Hill Greek-Style almond milk yogurt) or hot sauce, to serve

Mix the chickpea flour with

⅔ cup of water in a bowl and stir until smooth and free of lumps. Stir in the chopped herbs, scallions, walnuts, and ¼ teaspoon of salt.

Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat (adding a little olive oil or coconut oil if necessary). Spoon in ¼ of the batter, swirl around the skillet to spread evenly, and cook for about 2 minutes. When the top is dry, carefully flip it over and cook the other side for 2 minutes.

Transfer the ""omelet"" to a plate and cover with a piece of foil to keep it warm while you cook the other three ""omelets."" Serve with yogurt or hot sauce.

631,1,,"AUSTIN, Texas — If alien microbes crash-land on Earth, they may get a warm welcome.

When people were asked how they would react to the discovery of extraterrestrial microbial life, they give generally positive responses, researchers reported at a news conference February 16 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This suggests that if microbial life is found on Mars, Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus (SN: 5/13/17, p. 6) or elsewhere in the solar system, “we’ll take the news rather well,” said Michael Varnum, a social psychologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. What’s more, the tone of news reports announcing potential evidence for intelligent aliens suggests people would welcome that news, too.

Varnum and colleagues asked about 500 online volunteers — all in the United States — to describe how they would react if they learned scientists had discovered alien microbes. Varnum’s team analyzed each response using software that determined the fraction of words indicating positive emotion, such as “nice,” and negative emotion, like “worried.” The program also scanned for reward- and risk-focused words, such as “benefit” and “danger.”

People generally used more positive and reward-oriented words than negative and risk-oriented ones to describe their anticipated reactions. The same held true when participants were asked how they expected everyone else to take the news.

In another study, Varnum’s team asked about 500 U. S.-based volunteers to read one of two newspaper articles. One from 1996 reported the discovery of evidence for fossilized Martian microbes in a meteorite (SN: 8/10/96, p. 84). In the second, researchers announced in 2010 that they had created a synthetic bacterial cell in the lab (SN: 6/19/10, p. 5).

Both groups responded favorably to the articles, but the people who read about Martian microbes had a more positive reaction. This suggests that while people feel good about discoveries of any previously unknown life-forms, they are particularly keen on finding aliens, Varnum says.

But “any finding that comes from one population — like Americans — you have to take with a grain of salt,” Varnum says. He and his colleagues now hope to gather responses from participants of different cultures, to compare how people across the globe would take the news of alien microbes.

Psychologist and SETI researcher Douglas Vakoch, who heads the nonprofit organization Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence in San Francisco, suggests researchers also gauge reactions to different scenarios of alien microbial discovery. The Martian meteorite described in the 1996 article “has been on Earth for a long time and nothing bad has happened,” says Vakoch, who wasn’t involved in the work. “That’s a really safe scenario.” But, he wonders, are people as gung-ho about the prospect of finding live microbes on other planets or aboard meteorites?

And what if the aliens were intelligent? “If you find intelligent life elsewhere, [you] know that you’re not the only kid on the block,” says Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif. Knowing that human intelligence isn’t so special after all could provoke a much different emotional response than finding mere microbes “like pond scum in space,” Shostak says.

To get a sense of how people would feel about finding intelligent aliens, Varnum analyzed reports that the interstellar asteroid ‘Oumuamua could be an alien spaceship (SN Online: 12/18/17). The news articles took a largely positive angle. So the broader public might also take kindly to the discovery of little green men, Varnum says.

Although the incident did not result in any injuries, it served to illustrate rising tensions over the islets which were the focus of dispute that brought Greece and Turkey close to war in 1996.

Commenting after the incident on Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said that Greece's response to another similar incident would not be peaceful.

Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos echoed Kotzias on Friday morning, warning that aggression will be met with an equal response.

“If there is another act of Turkish aggression on Greek territory, there will be a response and there is no other way for us,” he told Skai TV.

The tougher rhetoric came as Turkish armed forces conducted an extensive war game near the Greek-Turkish land border by Evros river in Thrace.

This project of the non-governmental humanitarian organization from BiH has been realized since June, 2017. With the intention to ensure the continuity of a delivery of food to existing users, but also to expand this project to everyone who really need help, IFS – Emmaus started a new humanitarian action.

The project is intended for third age persons in a state of social need, who are sick and mostly living in distant rural areas and who cannot provide a meal on their own, or reach the soup kitchen.

At the very beginning, this project included 10 users from the area of Srebrenica and Bratunac.

After they got a real insight into the situation, the number of users was increased. Now, 99 users from this area receive one meal per day. The users were selected in the cooperation with the Center for Social Work of Srebrenica and the Municipality of Srebrenica, and they received a great financial support from the Rotari Club Srebrenica.

With the aim to help as many people as possible, the project was extended to Gracanica and Doboj East, where humanitarians are currently visiting a total of 83 users.

“I live alone, I have no one. This food is really great.  My wife recently passed away and my daughters are married, they live far away. It is hard for me to cook, I’m not used to it. Thank you, it really means a lot to me,” said Dzemal H. from Milacevici.

“This warm meal means a lot to me. I am sick, I cannot cook. I have a small disability allowance, but I have to pay for medicines and utilities, and I have nothing left. It really means a lot when somebody thinks about poor and sick people,” said Mujesira M.

“My country has matured and doesn’t need roots of more than 2,000 years to feel self-confident,” he said during an informal meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union and Western Balkan countries in Sofia.

“It’s better to cooperate on and compete over things that matter today than compete over who had more glorious victories and defeats in our rich history,” he said.

“We have the same approach toward the difference we have with Greece,” he added.

Dimitrov met earlier with his Greek counterpart Nikos Kotzias on the sidelines of the gathering. The pair held talks in Vienna, Austria, earlier this week.

Meanwhile, the president of Bulgaria, Rumen Radev, weighed into the decades-old name dispute between the two countries, saying the issue also concerns his country.

After meeting with FYROM President Gjorge Ivanov, Radev reportedly said that any name agreed on with Greece should not include “a geographical qualifier that is related to the territory of Bulgaria.” But he did not elaborate further.

646,1,,"US research has found that chemicals in everyday household products are now a key contributor to city air pollution, rivalling some vehicle emissions.

The study, led from Colorado University, focussed on so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

These are contained in petroleum-based products such as cleaning fluids and paints, and when they get into the air can form particles that affect health.

The scientists say the sources of non-vehicle VOCs have been underestimated.

This appears a somewhat surprising result because by weight, we use far more fuel than we do these other chemical products.

About 95% of raw oil goes into the production of fuels, whereas roughly only 5% is refined for use in chemicals that are included in the likes of deodorants, pesticides, and adhesives.

But Dr Jessica Gilman said it should not be seen as that remarkable because vehicle fuels are burned (to yield mostly carbon dioxide and water), whereas many of the household products are simply wafted into the air by design.

""Most commonly, they're used as solvents - things like nail polish remover, the hairspray I used this morning; they are used in many cases as cleaning agents like carpet cleaners,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist told reporters.

""It would be difficult to remove them because the alternative is to use straight water, which as you know doesn't work for all stains.""

One of Dr Gilman's colleagues, Dr Brian McDonald, did however suggest that reduced use would be helpful.

""Use as little of the product as you can to get the job done,"" he said.

The air we breathe contains such a diverse mix of compounds it's impossible for researchers to be sure what chemical is causing what problem.

And there's an even trickier issue - setting pollution limits that are appropriate for everyone. Air fresheners are loved by some people - but they make others choke. Cleaning sprays are useful - but they make some people's eyes run. I know someone whose childhood asthma is thought to have been provoked by chemical emissions from flat-packed furniture in his bedroom.

This is a neglected field of research as public and media attention has focused on cars outdoors at the expense of chemicals indoors.

The researchers pulled together a wide range of information for their study.

They looked again at what manufacturers put in their products; they reviewed the statistics held by regulatory agencies; they flew atmospheric sampling missions above Los Angeles to examine the air chemistry; and they also evaluated indoor and outdoor air quality measurements collected by other researchers.

The team concluded that in the US, the amount of VOCs emitted by consumer and industrial products is very probably two or three times greater than estimated by current air pollution inventories.  (There are also natural sources of VOCs in the environment.)

They add that these inventories likely also overestimate the motor vehicle sources.

The researchers cite as an example the current estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA considers that about 75% of petroleum-based VOC emissions come from vehicle fuels, and roughly 25% from chemical products.

The Colorado reassessment puts the split closer to 50-50.

""The use of these products emits VOCs in a magnitude that's comparable to what comes out of the tailpipe of your car. One of the main reasons for this is that in the US, as well as in Europe, air quality regulations have been really successful at controlling emissions from motor vehicles,"" said Dr McDonald, who is affiliated to the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Colorado and is the lead author on the study.

""In some ways, this is a good news story that, as we control some of the bigger sources in the past, the other sources are emerging in relative importance, such as these consumer products.""

Experts say the results of this research are broadly applicable to other industrialised nations, including those in Europe.

Anthony Frew, a professor of respiratory medicine at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the UK, commented: ""This research is a useful reminder that discussions of air pollution need to consider all sources of pollutants and that measures targeting cars only address part of the problem.

""Engineering changes to car exhausts have dramatically reduced the amount of pollution produced per mile, meaning that (a) there is now less to be gained from further changes to cars and (b) the public need more information on how their activities, apart from driving, contribute to current pollution levels.""

Vehicles emit pollutants beyond just VOCs, of course. These include nitrogen oxides (NOx). Indeed, it is the reaction between the NOx and the VOCs that produces some of the particles of most health concern.

The Colorado study is published in Science Magazine. It was also presented on Thursday to the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Austin, Texas.

BRASÍLIA - O Instituto Evandro Chagas, no Pará, identificou a presença do vírus da febre amarela no Aedes albopictus, mosquito conhecido como tigre asiático e que vive em áreas rurais e silvestre. A descoberta, inédita no mundo e comunicada nesta quinta-feira, 15, pelo diretor do instituto, Pedro Vasconcelos, vai desencadear uma nova frente de estudos sobre a transmissão da doença no País.

+ Ministério da Saúde recomenda que vacinação contra a febre amarela seja estendida

Uma força-tarefa foi criada com o objetivo de capturar exemplares do mosquito onde há transmissão de febre amarela: em São Paulo, no Rio e na Bahia. A missão começa em 15 dias. Eles serão levados para laboratório e criados em colônias. O objetivo é verificar se o mosquito, além de ser infectado pelo vírus, pode também transmitir a doença por meio da picada para seres humanos.

""É precipitado fazer qualquer julgamento"", afirmou Vasconcelos. Ele admite, no entanto, que se o Tigre Asiático for de fato outro vetor da febre amarela, há um potencial risco de um novo ciclo de transmissão da doença, o intermediário, nas Américas.

Hoje no País há a transmissão silvestre da febre amarela, promovida principalmente por mosquitos encontrados na mata: Haemagogus e Sabethes. Há também o risco de transmissão urbana, por meio da picada do Aedes aegypti contaminado. Esse tipo de transmissão não ocorre no Brasil desde 1942.

+ Vacina fracionada feita no Brasil protege contra febre amarela em 98% dos casos, diz estudo

O ciclo intermediário já ocorre na África. Ele permite a ligação do ciclo silvestre e urbano com o ciclo rural. A previsão é de que a força-tarefa saia a campo para captura dos mosquitos dentro de duas semanas. Os resultados obtidos com o estudo deverão ser concluídos em aproximadamente 50 dias. Os exemplares de tigres asiáticos contaminados com vírus de febre amarela foram capturados pela equipe do Evandro Chagas no primeiro semestre no passado, nas cidades mineiras de Itueta e Alvarenga.  As análises dos mosquitos foram concluídas neste mês.

Essa espécie está presente em cerca de mil municípios brasileiros, sobretudo em áreas rurais. ""Eles não vivem bem nas florestas"", explicou Vasconcelos. O presidente do Instituto Evandro Chagas afirma não haver, no momento, elementos que indiquem uma eventual relação entre o tigre asiático e a epidemia de febre amarela ocorrida no ano passado em Minas e no Espírito Santo.

A hipótese de que o Aedes albopictus pudesse também transmitir a febre amarela não é nova. Vários pesquisadores já haviam levantado essa suspeita, mas nenhum estudo havia comprovado a presença do vírus no mosquito. Isso, no entanto, não basta para garantir que o tigre asiático faz parte da cadeia de transmissão. “Vários mosquitos carregam o vírus, mas não têm capacidade de transmiti-los”, explicou Vasconcelos. O presidente do Instituto Evandro Chagas disse ser pouco provável de que o País já tenha a transmissão periurbana.

Cautela. O coordenador de controle de doenças da Secretaria de Saúde de São Paulo, o infectologista Marcos Boulos, afirmou ser necessário continuar os estudos sobre o Aedes albopictus e febre amarela. “Se for confirmado que o mosquito tem capacidade de transmitir o vírus, existe a possibilidade de transmissão periurbana”, afirmou.

651,1,,"In 2016, Gayle Jordan ran for the Tennessee State Senate in District 14, just south of Nashville. This was a deeply red district, so it wasn’t surprising that Jordan didn’t even come close. She lost by a 50-point margin.

That said, it was a story that she was even in the race for two reasons: Democrats usually don’t bother putting forward any candidates for this seat, and Jordan wanted to be a progressive alternative. She was also an open atheist, serving as the executive director for Recovering from Religion.

I thought the story of her political career ended there. But last November, a year after the election, Donald Trump nominated the winner of that race, Jim Tracy, to serve as the director of the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development office.

Tracy resigned from the State Senate to take on the new role, and there’s now a special election to fill his seat.

Naturally, Jordan is throwing her hat into the ring once again. She explained on Facebook last month:

Why do this again? Why return to a race where I experienced a 50-point defeat and expose myself to that again?

Because Tennessee is in dire need of compassionate rational leadership, someone with a big voice and a thick skin, someone who isn’t afraid to rise up, speak out, and push back against what the good ol boys dish out.

I raised 4 children as a stay-at-home mom with a military pilot spouse, who was gone more than he was home.

I started law school after all my kids left for college. I graduated, and passed the California Bar Exam on the first try.

In my role as president of our local soccer association, I fought our baseball-minded city, and helped bring about the development of a $13M, 17-field premier soccer complex.

I trained for and completed an Ironman Triathlon, winning my age division at age 50.

With hard work and determination, we’re fighting to bring reason and compassion to Tennessee!

Again, this is a red district that Republicans won by 50 points in 2016. The reaction to Jordan’s candidacy by the entire Tennessee Republican Party ought to have been a collective shrug.

But it looks like they’re worried. They must know that Republicans in deeply red districts have been losing a lot of elections since Trump took office. And even when they haven’t lost, they’ve won by substantially slimmer margins.

That would explain why the Party released a statement last night calling on voters to reject Jordan because she’s a “radical atheist.” Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Scott Golden specifically called on the Democrats running for governor to distance themselves from Jordan because of her “extreme” religious views.

“Gayle Jordan, darling of the Tennessee Democratic Party and their nominee for State Senate District 14, is what she herself calls a “firebrand atheist.” She isn’t simply non-religious, but actively works to lead people away from their faith. It’s her life’s work as the Executive Director of an organization called Recovering From Religion.

“Saying Gayle Jordan’s radical atheist views don’t represent the values of Tennesseans across this state or in District 14 is a gross understatement. She flat out attacks and rejects the fundamental social, moral, and religious beliefs of millions of Tennesseans. This type of extremism is being celebrated by the Tennessee Democratic Party and it is very concerning. Today I am asking if Democratic candidates for Governor, Karl Dean and Craig Fitzhugh, support Gayle Jordan and a Democratic Party that proudly espouse extreme views; candidates that shamelessly make statements such as “doing my part to destroy the fabric of America.”

“Tennesseans deserve to know if the potential Democratic nominee for Governor supports these radical views and will work to elect anti-Christian extremists to the state legislature. This is not about being a Republican or a Democrat, rather an acknowledgement that her public attacks on Christianity and outward anger towards those that believe in God are a far cry from the views of Tennessean families across this state and in District 14.”

There are so many things wrong with that statement (besides the audacity of attacking a political candidate for her religious views, something that would be unacceptable if they did it to a Jew or Muslim).

For example, they’re angry that she tries to “lead people away from their faith.” Christians try to convert people all the time — to the point where they celebrate the number of baptisms their churches perform in a given month. But bringing people to Christ is apparently okay.

What are “radical” atheist views, anyway? If being an atheist means you don’t believe in God, does a “radical” atheist not pray even harder? We’ve had this debate before. For much of the general public, an “extremist” atheist is just like a regular atheist, except we have the courage to criticize religion out loud. (Compare that to a “radical” Christian or Muslim; those connotations are hardly peaceful.)

They claim Jordan is an “anti-Christian extremist” even though she’s never said anything about how Christians shouldn’t have the right to worship. She’s not the one issuing a statement calling on top Republicans to distance themselves from other candidates because they happen to believe in God. The Republicans are just mad she’s willing to fight for the sorts of minorities that white evangelicals routinely condemn, including LGBTQ people.

As for her apparent statement about “doing my part to destroy the fabric of America,” the GOP gave no context for it, but I read that as a joke. She’s using their talking point against them by saying she’s had enough of the GOP’s anti-women, anti-gay, anti-immigrant bigotry. (Update: The context of this statement was, indeed, tongue in cheek. Jordan officiated a same-sex wedding last December and posted the line on Facebook. It’s a joke, people.)

Jordan didn’t respond to my request for a statement last night.

But it’s this sort of attack that demonstrates why we need more atheists running for office. Republicans love creating straw men of us, assuming that our disbelief in God is somehow a danger to people who are religious. It never is. We want to persuade you to see things our way, but the atheists I know proudly defend other people’s right to believe in whatever nonsense they want to. (And I know plenty of Christians who want to maintain a separation between their faith and their politics.)

Jordan wants to run for office because there are people marginalized and demonized by the Christians in power. And because she’s willing to do that, those Christians are condemning her for not having an imaginary friend. As if that’s the new prerequisite for public office.

The problem isn’t that Jordan is a “radical atheist”; they would’ve done the same thing if she was merely an atheist in private. The problem is that Republicans have competition in what they always considered to be a safe seat, and they’re worried Tennessee will start to turn purple.

All the more reason for Jordan to keep speaking out.

The election takes place a month from today. You can donate to her campaign right here.

657,1,,"Der Präsident hatte eine klare Meinung: ""Wir in der Regierung müssen uns vor unbefugtem Einfluss durch den militärisch-industriellen Komplex schützen."" Die enorme Macht von Rüstungsindustrie und Militär stelle eine Bedrohung für die Freiheit und die Demokratie in den USA dar, es gelte deshalb, ihren Einfluss zu begrenzen.

So sprach Dwight D. Eisenhower 1961. Heute, fast 60 Jahre später, gibt sich der 45. US-Präsident alle Mühe, derartige Warnungen zu ignorieren. In Trump haben Militär und Waffenindustrie einen mächtigen Verbündeten. Die USA rüsten auf wie lange nicht.

Zuletzt waren die Ausgaben für das Militär gedrosselt worden, Trumps Vorgänger Barack Obama steckte mehr Mittel in Diplomatie und Entwicklungshilfe. Trump macht das genaue Gegenteil. Er kürzt dem Außenministerium und den Vereinten Nationen das Geld. Dafür soll der Wehretat von heute 606 Milliarden Dollar auf sagenhafte 742 Milliarden im Jahr 2023 ansteigen. Zum Vergleich: Das ist mehr als das Doppelte des gesamten deutschen Bundeshaushalts.

Das Militär ist Trumps größte politische Obsession. ""Ich liebe das Militär. Ich werde es wiederaufbauen. Es wird stärker und größer sein als jemals zuvor"", versprach er bereits im Wahlkampf. Die Rüstungsindustrie ist begeistert. Die Aktien von Waffen-Konzernen wie Northrop Grumman gehören zu den großen Gewinnern im Dow-Jones-Index mit Zuwächsen zwischen 20 und 40 Prozent innerhalb eines Jahres.

Noch muss der Kongress dem Militärbudget zustimmen. Doch es gilt als ausgemacht, dass Trump hier wohl einen Großteil seiner Forderungen durchsetzen kann. Konkret sollen die Ausgaben in folgende Bereiche fließen:

* Vor allem sollen neue Raketen, Flugzeuge und Schiffe angeschafft werden. Unter Obama klagten die Militärs darüber, dass sie für eine Modernisierung der Streitkräfte dringend benötigte Waffensysteme in allen Sparten nicht mehr bezahlen könnten. Nun stellt Verteidigungsminister James Mattis zufrieden fest, das neue Finanzpolster sei ausreichend, um die weltweite ""Überlegenheit des US-Militärs"" sicherzustellen.

* Unter anderem sollen in Alaska neue Raketenabwehrsysteme installiert werden, um Angriffe aus China, Russland oder Nordkorea abzuwehren. Außerdem ist der Kauf von 77 F-35-Kampfflugzeugen und 24 F-18 ""Super Hornets"" gesichert.

* Die US-Flotte soll von heute 277 auf mehr als 350 Schiffe anwachsen. Unter Experten ist zwar umstritten, wie lange dieser Ausbau dauern wird. Manche glauben, dass es auch mit dem Trump-Budget noch mindestens 30 Jahre braucht, um diese Kampfkraft zu erreichen. Aber: Der Start des maritimen Aufrüstungsprogramms ist nun möglich.

* In Europa wollen die USA mehr Geld ausgeben. Unter anderem sollen zusätzliche Milliarden bereitgestellt werden, um die US-Truppenpräsenz an der Nato-Ostgrenze gegenüber Russland zu sichern und zu stärken. Auch das Arsenal der US-Atomwaffen soll modernisiert werden.

Frieden schaffen ohne Waffen - diese Formel ist Donald Trump offenbar fremd. Der Präsident und Verteidigungsminister Mattis argumentieren, die frischen Milliarden für das Militär seien dringend erforderlich, um mögliche Rivalen wie China und Russland in Schach zu halten, die ebenfalls aufrüsten. Amerika dürfte nicht verwundbar gegen Angriffe werden. Es gehe darum, durch Abschreckung ""Kriege zu verhindern"", beteuert Trump.

Zweifellos wären Trump und seine Generäle aber auch bereit, ihre Waffen einzusetzen, wenn es darauf ankäme. Zum Beispiel in Asien: Für den Fall einer Eskalation der Nordkorea-Krise hat der Präsident bereits unterschiedliche Kriegsszenarien ausarbeiten lassen.

Hinter Trumps Militär-Tick steckt aber noch mehr: Der Präsident, der als Teenager selbst eine Kadettenschule besuchte, verehrt Soldaten. Sie passen für ihn perfekt zum Image des ""starken Mannes"", das er so gern pflegt. Trumps Lobreden auf die Armee sorgen bei seinen extrem patriotisch gesinnten Anhängern an der Republikaner-Basis stets für großen Jubel und laute ""USA, USA""-Rufe.

Im Weißen Haus sitzen auf etlichen wichtigen Positionen Ex-Militärs, sein Büro ließ Trump sofort nach seinem Einzug mit den Fahnen der US-Waffengattungen schmücken. Es fehle nur noch, dass er der Präsident bald in

einer Fantasieuniform auftrete, kommentierte die ""Washington Post"" jüngst.

Bisweilen wird Trumps Faible für alles Militärische aber offenbar sogar den Generälen unheimlich. Den Wunsch des Präsidenten, noch in diesem Jahr eine große Militärparade in Washington abzuhalten, bearbeiten die Experten im Pentagon nur unwillig. Zu teuer, zu aufwendig, sei die Sache, heißt es im Verteidigungsministerium. Angeblich sollen die Kosten bei 30 Millionen Dollar liegen.

Nach Ansicht etlicher Offiziere widerspricht eine Parade außerdem der amerikanischen Kultur. Aufmärsche dieser Art finden in den USA nur sehr selten statt, etwa als Siegesparaden nach großen Kriegen.

Trump wolle mit den Soldaten, die an ihm vorbeimarschieren und salutieren, lediglich sein Image aufpolieren, meint der Ex-General Paul Eaton. ""Dies ist keine amerikanische Tradition. Dies ist die Tradition von totalitären System wie Nordkorea oder China.""

Zusammengefasst: Donald Trump verehrt Soldaten, sie passen zu seinem Idealbild vom ""starken Mann"". Nun lässt der Präsident das US-Militär massiv ausbauen, das Budget steigt um viele Milliarden Dollar. Damit, so das Weiße Haus, soll Amerikas Vormacht in der Welt gesichert werden. Für Diplomatie ist da wenig Platz. Mit seinem jüngst geäußerte Wunsch nach einer Militärparade stößt Trump aber sogar bei den Truppen auf Widerstand.

658,2,,"Rozner neřekl, že Tábor Lety je neexistující, ale řekl, že to byl neexistující koncentrák. A to má pravdu, protože tábor byl sběrný pracovní tábor a později internační.

Bylo mi osm, seděl jsem vedle kočího, tehdy mě zajímali hlavně ty koně. Najednou na mě padla strašná tíseň, děti mají silnější instinkty než dospělí. Říkal jsem to otci a ptal jsem se, co to je. On mi řekl, že nedaleko místa, kudy jedeme, se děly strašlivé věci, a že až budu dospělý, vysvětlí mi to,“ říká Schwarzenberg. Pravdu o Letech se tak dozvěděl v pozdějším věku.

To teď říká například pan Horáček. Jak lze takovým lidem vůbec věřit, co říkají? A svědčí to ještě o jiné věci. A to, že pan Drahoš v dobré víře skočil na lep falešným vejlupkům, kteří chtěli realizovat své ambice a představy jeho prostřednictvím. Myslím si, že to je pro pana Drahoše ponaučení. Pro mě ne, mě to nepřekvapuje. Ale takové chování mě mrzí. Já jsem ho sice nevolil – a to je v demokracii normální, že každý volí svého kandidáta – ale přesto si myslím, že člověk si může svého soupeře vážit, a já nemám důvod, abych si profesora Drahoše nevážil. Takové chování si od svých podporovatelů opravdu nezasloužil…

Například pan Mitrofanov ve svém komentáři na Novinkách ze 3. ledna fakticky označil voliče Miloše Zemana za závistivce, hlupáky a sprosťáky. Ale především o nich napsal, že „jsou obyvateli, nejsou občany“. Zbavování „nezpůsobilých a nespolehlivých občanů“ občanství je nástrojem totalitní zvůle. To jsme již zažili v době jakobínského teroru, nacismu i v době komunismu. Pan Hríb hovořil o tom, že Češi jsou primitivní a sobečtí. Něco podobného říkal i pan Pehe. A i toto jsou důvody, proč jsem veřejně a transparentně finančně podpořil Miloše Zemana. To je věc, která nemá s ideologií a politikou nic společného. To je jen o lidské slušnosti.

V rámci lidské slušnosti – už jsem to naznačil i u Václava Havla – je mi až trapné o tom mluvit, ale dobře. Pokusím se to aspoň trochu odlehčit. Tento náš rozhovor děláme ve středu 7. února. Od vyhlášení výsledků voleb jsem v médiích zaznamenal, že pan prezident prodělal od infarktu přes mrtvici. S velkým napětím si počkám, zda se pan prezident zítra podle pracovního plánu setká s premiérem Andrejem Babišem. Pokud tato večeře proběhne a pokud se píše, že pan prezident během posledních deseti dnů prodělal infarkt a mrtvici, tak buď to je hnusná sprostá lež za účelem ublížit a poškodit ho a je to pokračování sprosté kampaně jeho odpůrců, anebo se stal skutečný zázrak, protože medicína nikde na světě by s tím nic neudělala, a pak vyzývám předsednictvo strany lidové, aby uspořádalo průvod na Hrad v čele s páterem Halíkem a iniciovalo svatořečení Miloše Zemana ještě za jeho života, protože po infarktu a mrtvici může pracovní večeři absolvovat jenom člověk zachráněný nadpřirozenou silou. (K pracovní večeři Andreje Babiše a Miloše Zemana skutečně došlo – pozn. redakce.)

Pokud jde o jednání o vládě, tak ještě do včerejška (míněn 6. únor) jsem za relevantní politickou stranu považoval i ODS. V úterý dopoledne první místopředsedkyně strany Udženija řekla, že ODS neodmítá koalici s ANO, a dokonce neodmítá ani to, že by v čele takové vlády stál obviněný Andrej Babiš, a to jedině s podmínkou exkluzivity takového jednání, a cituji „výrazných programových a personálních ústupků, a ne žádných drobečků, jak to ANO nabízí jiným“. Později odpoledne vystoupil předseda ODS a toto vše dementoval a řekl, že pro ODS je jakákoli spolupráce s hnutím ANO na vládní úrovni nepřijatelná. Předpokládám, že po skončení oficiálního zasedání výkonné rady ODS se výkonná rada změní na sabat a konzumují tam nějaké veselé houbičky, protože jinak by takovou věc, kdy během dne se vystoupení dvou nejvyšších představitelů ODS navzájem absolutně popírají, nevysvětlil ani tak slovutný politolog jako profesor Fiala.

Pokud jde o sociální demokracii, tak se vlastní vinou dostala do poměrně velmi složité situace. U žádného adepta na vedení ČSSD jsem nezaznamenal, že by řekl, že si neumí představit jakékoli angažmá ve vládě s ANO a Andrejem Babišem či nějakou spolupráci. Rád si počkám na to, jak by spolupráci s ANO potom vysvětlovali voličům. Protože ta samá ČSSD, která se nyní nebrání spolupráci s Babišem a ANO, vyhodila Andreje Babiše z vlády, kdy téměř došlo k pádu vlády. Co se za těch deset měsíců změnilo? Andreje Babiše obvinili, to se změnilo. Tak jak ta samá ČSSD vysvětlí, že Andrej Babiš v květnu a červnu neměl pravdu, když říkal, že si berou občany jako rukojmí v rámci boje o moc a komplotu proti němu, zatímco oni tehdy tvrdili, že jde o ideály? Takže na to vysvětlení jsem moc zvědav.

Já to pojmu více obecněji. Problém české politiky je, že se zaprvé neposlouchá, CO kdo říká, ale KDO co říká. Zadruhé dryáčnické vymezování se vůči komukoli za hranu normálnosti brání po volbách domluvení kompromisů, které jsou v politice běžné, a brání to složení jakékoli vlády. Před chvílí jsme se bavili o sociální demokracii. Ta dnes nemá dobré řešení. Buď bude v opozici, a být v opozici je velmi těžké, nebo se nějakým způsobem bude podílet na vládě, ale tím ukáže, že před volbami voličům lhali. To samé můžeme říci o jakékoli jiné politické straně. Snad s výjimkou komunistů a SPD, kteří se fakticky vůči nikomu nevymezovali, jen se ostatní vymezovali vůči nim.

Varuji před zjednodušenými historickými srovnáními, jako bylo například prohlášení Mirka Topolánka o noci dlouhých nožů. Nehrajme si s tím. Myslím si, že zde skutečně chybí nějaká vážná diskuse, ale nejenom o tom, co se týká tábora v Letech. Já jsem v minulosti aspoň částečně měl snahu se s tím seznámit. Všem doporučuji, aby si přečetli knížku kanadského autora Polanského s názvem Bouře. Je velmi zajímavá a s pohledem cizince ukazuje přístup politické reprezentace k této problematice v první polovině devadesátých let a jaké mu kladla překážky. Kteří lidé to byli a proč. Zároveň tam je zachycen vznik toho tábora.

Já jsem byl 12 let v obecním zastupitelstvu, byl jsem i v radě. Mockrát jsme řešili otázku obecného zájmu – koupi nějakého majetku pro obec. Představte si situaci, že máte pomník padlým v první světové válce, je to v centru obce a okolo toho je trávník a ten trávník má jiného majitele, než je obec. A ten se o to nestará a ta tráva tam vesele roste. Odhadní cena toho trávníku je třicet tisíc. Majitel za něj chce po obci sto tisíc. Když by to ti zastupitelé v zájmu obce koupili, tak máme desítky zkušeností, že riskují, že budou následně obviněni.

Takže když se vrátíme k Letům, není pochyb o tom, že ten vepřín nemá hodnotu 450 milionů. Politická reprezentace se rozhodla, že důvod k odkupu je, a koupila to. To je politické rozhodnutí, to není ekonomické rozhodnutí. O co oni jsou víc, než je zastupitelstvo jakékoli obce v České republice?

Ještě bych to trochu posunul. Je důležité si připomínat hrdinství lidí i zrůdnost režimů. A měli bychom vědět, že ne každá oběť byla zároveň hrdinou. Není to vždy černobílé. Je nutné o tom mluvit. Není to jen o tom, o čem hovoří Tomio Okamura, že se ty peníze mohly použít na zlepšení sociální situace těch lidí. Pro budoucnost je daleko důležitější, abychom o těchto věcech mluvili. Jenom hlupák, který se nepoučí z vlastní historie, je nucen ji prožívat znovu. Jestli v něčem máme deficit, tak zrovna v těchto věcech. Jsem pro to, aby stát dal peníze na výzkum objektivního poznání pravdy. Pro naše děti je důležité, aby dokázaly rozpoznat nebezpečí a dokázaly odlišit, kdo je hrdina, kdo je oběť a kdo je útočník, a aby se v tom dokázaly zorientovat.

Jan Masaryk – nepochybně oběť, i když přesně nevíme koho. Ale jaká byla jeho role? On demisi v roce 1948 nepodal. Je pravda něco na tom, že se nechal zlákat Klementem Gottwaldem, že po smrti nemocného Edvarda Beneše bude jeho důstojným nástupcem on? Je pravda, že díky tomu, že on demisi nepodal, nepodala demisi nadpoloviční většina vlády a prezidentu Benešovi nezbylo, než nechat vládu předsedou vlády Gottwaldem pouze rekonstruovat? Jaký byl podíl českých četníků a podnikatelů na vytvoření tábora v Letech? To jsou vše historická fakta, která nás mohou obohatit.

Další příběh – Vladimír Brabec, chcete-li major Zeman. Zemřel a v novinách byl dehonestován za to, že hrál hlavní roli v tomto prokomunistickém seriálu. Vladimír Brabec ale nikdy nebyl členem komunistické strany. Byl to herec, tak hrál. Pak tu máme Jana Třísku, údajného agenta Státní bezpečnosti (měl mít krycí jméno TOMAN s evidenčním číslem 5680 – pozn. red.), signatáře anticharty. V seriálu majora Zemana hrál taky. Takže jenom proto, že emigroval a byl to přítel Václava Havla, je vynášen slavnostně z Národního divadla? Takže se ptám, zdali tento selektivní přístup nerozděluje naši společnost.

OKNO DO SVĚTA TEREZY SPENCEROVÉ „Ano, zdá se, že nějací ruští žoldáci v Sýrii americkými bombami a raketami opravdu zabiti byli. A byla to nejspíš první ‚ruská krev‘, kterou Amerika v Sýrii prolila. Ale zatímco ruští nacionalisté, kteří by si to s Amerikou nejraději ‚rozdali bez rukavic‘, měsíc před prezidentskými volbami čísla přifukují a mluví až o šesti stech mrtvých, Kreml ani nedutá a tváří se, že se ho to nijak netýká, neb se soukromou armádou přece nemá nic společného.

V rámci pravidelného shrnutí týdenních událostí na ParlamentníchListech.cz komentuje i přiznané lži o Vladimiru Putinovi.

Všimla jsem si onoho Macronova výroku a pokrčila rameny. Přišel totiž pár hodin poté, co jeho ministr zahraničí otevřeně přiznal, že Paříž nemá žádné důkazy o tom, že by Damašek používal chemické zbraně, a pár dní poté, co sám Macron připustil, že zničení Libye bylo chybou, a to i chybou francouzskou, protože právě jeden z jeho předchůdců, Nicolas Sarkozy, byl snad hlavním strůjcem tamní „demokratizační“ tragédie, která ve finále zesílila migrační proud do Evropy. Mimochodem, absenci jakýchkoli důkazů o chemických zbraních používaných syrských režimem přiznává i šéf Pentagonu Jim Mattis.

Takhle jednoznačně bych to neviděla. Ano, poprvé se o „Wagnerovi“ opravdu mluvilo ve chvíli, kdy „zelení mužíčci“ začali odzbrojovat ukrajinské jednotky na Krymu. To byla očividná „státní zakázka“. Dnes je ale Wagnerova skupina regulérní soukromá žoldnéřská armáda srovnatelná třeba s americkým Blackwaterem a mnoha dalšími. Faktem je, že v Sýrii působí někdy od roku 2015 a vesměs coby „strážní“ služba u některých ropných a plynových zařízení. Občas ale bojovala i po boku syrské armády nebo tamních místních „soukromých armád“, a to údajně u Palmyry nebo v Aleppu. A platí si ji podle všeho ruští oligarchové, kteří spolu se svými syrskými kolegy-oligarchy počítají s budoucími zisky ze syrských surovinových zdrojů. A platí pro ni totéž, co pro americké nebo jiné „soukromé armády“, tedy že stát za ně jakoby nenese žádnou odpovědnost, a tak mohou být na bojišti jeho „politicky beztrestnou“ prodlouženou rukou…

Nicméně, k počátku vaší otázky. Ano, zdá se, že nějací ruští žoldáci v Sýrii americkými bombami a raketami opravdu zabiti byli. A byla to nejspíš první „ruská krev“, kterou Amerika v Sýrii prolila. Ale zatímco ruští nacionalisté, kteří by si to s Amerikou nejraději „rozdali bez rukavic“, měsíc před prezidentskými volbami čísla přifukují a mluví až o šesti stech mrtvých, Kreml ani nedutá a tváří se, že se ho to nijak netýká, neb se soukromou armádou přece nemá nic společného. Osobně si ale myslím, že nejblíž jsou ruské expertní zdroje, které mluví o maximálně dvaceti zabitých žoldácích.

Kdybyste mi o té petici neřekl, vůbec bych netušila, že něco takového zase vzniklo. A upřímně, ani nevím, co k tomu dodat. No tak pár lidí po sedmi letech válčení podepsalo petici na sedm let staré téma. No a? Mají na to svaté demokratické právo, ne? Stačí se umět podepsat. Ivan Gabal se s tímto svým „srdečním“ tématem – zrušit naši ambasádu v Damašku –  nedostal ani do Parlamentu, přesto je ale asi třeba na tomto mrtvém koni rajtovat dál a připisovat všechno zlo jen jedné, té Asadově straně konfliktu. Je legrační, že tím signatáři fakticky ze všech zel vyviňují nejen USA – to ještě chápu – ale i Daeš, Al-Káidu a tak podobně, čímž vlastně ve svém důsledku vyjadřují podporu terorismu. Mám dojem, že na podporu terorismu jsou u nás paragrafy. Ale na druhou stranu, proti gustu žádný dišputát.

Legrační bylo, když premiér Rutte sice měl lži svého ministra za „velkou chybu“, ale jinak jej označil za „důvěryhodného“. Západní politik, důvěryhodný lhář. Tak to jo, to jsem se fakt zasmála. Sice trochu křečovitě, ale zasmála. A vážné je to především kvůli tomu, že právě „ruskou expanzí“ státy NATO vysvětlují novou vlnu zbrojení a posilování jednotek na ruských hranicích, čímž samozřejmě vzrůstá teoretická pravděpodobnost vypuknutí války Západu proti Rusku. A pokud si západní politici argumenty pro takovou eskalaci vymýšlejí, jako je tomu v případě onoho nizozemského ministra, který mimochodem nakonec přece jen sám podal demisi, tak potěš pánbu.

Jako by nestačil jeden smyšlený Irák a jeho „zbraně hromadného ničení“, které neexistovaly. Důsledky tehdejší lži a následné agrese pociťujeme dodnes, mimo jiné i hrozbou Islámského státu. Teď se ale lži, které mohou vést k válce, přesouvají citelně blíž k našim hranicím. Je dobré si toho ministra pamatovat, až zase podobnou písničku spustí nějaký jiný západní politik, ty naše samozřejmě nevyjímaje… Mimochodem, připadá mi dost bizarní, že spousta českých politiků vylhanou americkou agresi proti Iráku podporovala, a teď to, v případě Ruska, dělá zase… Je to trapné, ale na druhou stranu i důsledné. To se jim zase musí nechat. Nejsou to žádné korouhvičky! Budu se radši mýlit s USA, než mít pravdu s Ruskem, jak kdysi prohlásila paní Šiklová…

A co se týče Putinova zdraví, tak opravdu nevím, jak na tom je. Ale ani bych se nedivila, kdyby se roznemohl – vždyť si jen v duchu spočítejte, co všechno ten „Génius zla“ ve světě každou hodinu každého dne a rok za rokem musí páchat! To by musel být opravdu superman, aby to všechno zmáknul, vydržel a ani jednou za čas nepadl vysílením…

No, on ten slovenský soud ve skutečnosti rozhodl, že slovenský Ústav pameti národa je archivní institucí a jako takový jej prostě nelze žalovat za to, že někoho neoprávněně vede ve svazcích StB. Čili je to trochu jinak, než hlásají titulky v našem mainstreamu. Ale, upřímně řečeno, i kdyby agent byl, tak je mi to už – po více než čtvrt století od Listopadu – skoro jedno. Mimo jiné i proto, že agenty StB najdete třeba v Evropském parlamentu a vlastně kdekoli „tam nahoře“, napravo nalevo, kam se člověk podívá. „Sestřelit“ kvůli tomu jen Babiše a ostatní nechat u koryt a rozhodovacích pravomocí – na principu „zlý agent StB, hodný agent StB“ – by mi připadalo krajně trapné.

Kde se vzala, tu se vzala, rozhořela se v Česku debata na téma referendum o vystoupení z EU. A proevropská média, tedy v zásadě všechna, se předhánějí v katastrofických odhadech, jak by s naší zemí odchod z EU zamával. Že by to prý byla nejhorší katastrofa za posledních 100 let. Jak tuto debatu vnímáte? A jak vnímáte slova například Petry Procházkové, že mnoho voličů je tak blbých, že nejsou schopní rozhodnout o tak odborné otázce, jako je vystoupení z EU?

Osobně bych řekla, že když se někdo z Prahy rozhodne odstěhovat třebas do Brna, nikdo by mu posléze neměl bránit v tom, aby případně dal výpověď, zpřetrhal všechny tamní ekonomické i lidské svazky, které se mu podařilo navázat, a vrátil se zpět začít od nuly do Prahy. I kdyby tím přišel o nějaké peníze a bůhví co ještě. (Mimochodem, pro Brňáky to obráceně platí úplně stejně.) Nejde mi zkrátka do hlavy argument, podle něhož byl národ dostatečně inteligentní, aby do EU v referendu vstoupil, ale vzápětí podle všeho zblbl natolik, že o vystoupení už rozhodovat nesmí. To je přece hodně divné, slušně řečeno.

Osobně neumím na otázku Czexitu odpovědět. Na jednu stranu cítím sounáležitost s Evropou, ale to mě přepadá hlavně, když jsem třeba na Blízkém východě a potkám se tam s nějakou „bledou tváří“. S Evropanem si člověk rozumí mnohem víc než třeba s Američanem nebo Australanem, plusovou výjimku občas umějí vytvořit Kanaďané. Nevím, co by Českou republiku po vystoupení z EU čekalo, ale vzhledem k tomu, že dnes se vše přepočítává na peníze a ekonomiku, tak asi nic moc zásadního by nepřišlo. Možná bychom kvůli úbytku unijních peněz měli míň akvaparků, ale to záměrně zjednodušuju. Protože jsme přívažek německého průmyslu, jakousi xtou provincií Německa, a na tom by se asi nic moc nezměnilo. Možná ale ano, a to já opravdu nevím. Na druhou stranu platí, že pidistát, jakým je Česko, nemá žádné dobré možnosti svobodné volby. Za každá nezávislý krok něčím zaplatí. A dává smysl spojovat se s nacionalistickými státy typu Polska a Maďarska, nebo na tom budeme ve finále jen biti? Nicméně žádné dobré volby dnes podle mého nemá skoro žádný stát Evropy. Síla je jen v jednotě a proto se mi EU jako idea silné a sebevědomé Evropy líbí. Ale současně platí, že „bruselští“ jsou už tak mimo poslední zbytky selského rozumu, že je možná lepší uprchnout a na rizika nehledět…

Je to zkrátka složité, rizikové, ale představa, že moudřeji o tom rozhodne někdo „tam nahoře“, koho si ti „hloupí“ lidé „tam dole“ moudře zvolili, zatímco ti samí lidé, občané, kteří si ty „moudré“ tak „moudře“ zvolili, do toho nemají co mluvit, se mi příčí. Tady končí demokracie. A začíná Půlnoční království.

669,4,,"Veřejná debata o referendu nabírá obrátky. Ať už v souvislosti s případným setrváním v EU nebo v otázkách odvolatelnosti politiků. Co se týká EU, slyšíme nejrůznější informace o důležitosti setrvání, ať už ekonomické, o tom, že zchudneme o polovinu nebo o třetinu, nebo o nutnosti setrvání v evropské rodině už s ohledem na to, že jsme malým státem atp. V pořadu ČT 168 hodin varovali například před odchodem japonských investorů a návratem do roku 1987. Podle hlavního analytika České spořitelny Petra Zahradníka by vystoupení z EU ekonomicky znamenalo „katastrofu, apokalypsu a největší destrukci za posledních možná sto let“. Jednoduše řečeno: ano, či ne? A proč? A opět, jakou roli i v tomto případě podle vás sehraje mediální scéna?

Také se objevila iniciativa olomoucké univerzity. Zejména rektor Jaroslav Miller se po prezidentských volbách utvrdil v názoru, že by univerzity měly být aktivnější ve veřejném životě. V průběhu letošního roku tak bude jeho škola vysílat do regionů dobrovolníky z řad studentů práv, medicíny nebo třeba sociologie, aby lidem pomohli řešit jejich existenční problémy nebo jim nabídli kvalitní informace, například o migraci nebo Evropské unii a o tom, jaké má dopady na jejich životy. Píše o tom server iHNed.cz. Bude mít tato „terénní univerzita“ efekt, který si autoři záměru slibují, tedy „zakopávání příkopů ve společnosti“? Je to dobrý nápad? Přidají se i další univerzity?

Dívala jsem se, že pan rektor Miller je poměrně mladý člověk dospívající již v novém zřízení po roce 1989, takže mládežnické aktivity 50. let ho pravděpodobně nepoznamenaly. Přesto bych u historika a člověka, který se zabývá dějinami politického myšlení, předpokládala alespoň elementární znalost těchto budovatelských praktik. Třebaže mladí mají energie na rozdávání a kolektivismus v jejich srdcích zažehává jiskru života, měli by jejich mentoři především apelovat na to, aby z nich vyrostli zdraví, sebevědomí a svým vzděláním v oboru společnosti prospěšní jedinci, a ne aby se za peníze daňových poplatníků účastnili propagandy, kterou pan Miller momentálně ve svém svatém zápalu pokládá za veřejnosti prospěšnou.

Procuradoria pede dois anos de prisão a envolvidos em escândalo de manipulação   Wellington Silva, do Internacional, é um dos envolvidos e periga ser suspenso por seis anos do futebol           Um juiz espanhol reabriu o processo que investiga a partida entre Zaragoza e Levante pela última rodada do Campeonato Espanhol de 2011, e os 41 envolvidos no caso perigam pegar uma pena de dois anos de prisão, além da suspensão de seis anos do futebol. Entre os 36 jogadores acusados, estão: Ander Herrera, do Manchester United, Gabi, do Atlético de Madrid, Ponzio, do River Plate, e o brasileiro Wellington Silva, do Inter. O técnico Javier Aguirre, ex-Zaragoza, também está na lista. As informações são do jornal ""Marca"".     Por meio de nota enviada pela assessoria de imprensa, o advogado de Wellington Silva, Alexandre Soares, ""negou, veementemente, qualquer conhecimento ou participação neste episódio, caso tenha ocorrido"". Alexandre ressalta que o jogador brasileiro já prestou esclarecimentos à justiça espanhola anteriormente.     – O atleta nunca recebeu qualquer valor ou contato de ninguém a respeito desses fatos, colocando à disposição, inclusive, voluntariamente, a quebra do seu sigilo fiscal e bancário. Com uma possível reabertura do processo para avalição em segunda instância, a pedido do Ministério Público, que foi arquivado em primeira por falta de provas, o jogador continua à disposição para qualquer esclarecimento que ainda se fizer necessário – diz o advogado de Wellington Silva.               Gabi em depoimento sobre Zaragoza x Levante em 2011 (Foto: EFE)        Uma prisão, entretanto, é vista como improvável. De acordo com a legislação espanhola, em caso de condenação igual ou inferior a dois anos e na ausência de antecedentes, os jogadores não precisarão cumprir a pena na cadeia mesmo que sejam considerados culpados pela Justiça.     A corte, baseada em Valência, decidiu reabrir o caso depois de apelação da promotoria. Movimentações bancárias ""muito claras"" são indícios que levam tanto a corte quanto a promotoria a crer que os jogadores do Levante perderam a partida de propósito para salvar o Zaragoza do rebaixamento.                Hoje no Inter, Wellington Silva defendia o Levante à época (Foto: Ricardo Duarte / Internacional / Divulgação)        O jogo marcou a permanência do Zaragoza na elite espanhola após a vitória de 2 a 1. A suspeita é que jogadores tenham repassado € 965 mil (cerca de R$ 3 milhões e 775 mil na cotação atual) aos jogadores do Levante para que eles perdessem a partida. Confira os melhores momentos do jogo aqui.     Zaragoza e Levante, assim como os jogadores que representavam ambas as equipes na época, negam que esse fato tenha acontecido. Gabi, hoje capitão do Atlético de Madrid, foi o autor dos dois gols da vitória do Zaragoza no jogo.      Zaragoza: Maurizio Lanzaro, Toni Doblas, Paulo da Silva, Jorge López, Ander Herrera, Braulio Nóbrega, Leo Ponzio, Gabi Fernández, Carlos Diogo, Ivan Obradovic, Ikechukwu Uche, Adam Pinter, Javier Paredes, Leo Franco, Jiri Jarosik, Nicolás Bertolo, Said Boutahar e Ángel Lafita.

Técnico e presidente do PSG reclamam da arbitragem: ""Ajudou o Real Madrid""   Unai Emery e Nasser Al-Khelaifi criticam atuação de Gianluca Rocchi. Dono do clube, por outro lado, mostra confiança: ""Acredito nos meus jogadores, no meu técnico, nós vamos nos classificar""                Assista aos melhores momentos de Real Madrid 3x1 PSG        O técnico Unai Emery e o presidente/dono do Paris Saint-Germain, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, acharam injusta a derrota por 3 a 1 para o Real Madrid no Santiago Bernabéu. Após a partida, ambos reclamaram da arbitragem de Gianluca Rocchi, que segundo eles teve influência no resultado.     - Fizemos um segundo tempo muito bom. Acho que o árbitro deu dois cartões aos nossos jogadores (Rabiot e Meunier) que não eram para ser dados. Essas pequenas coisas fazem a diferença. O árbitro ajudou (o Real) também - disse Al-Khelaifi.     - O árbitro os favoreceu nas faltas e nos cartões amarelos. E para mim não foi pênalti. Me disseram que houve uma mão do Sergio Ramos na área não marcada. O critério não foi o mesmo - afirmou Unai Emery.               Atuação do árbitro Gianluca Rocchi foi criticado pelo PSG (Foto: Reuters)        Apesar do revés no jogo de ida pelas oitavas de final da Liga dos Campeões, o presidente e dono do clube se mostrou muito confiante na conquista da vaga nas quartas.     - Acho que não foi uma partida ruim pra gente. Nós terminamos 90 minutos e ainda temos mais 90 na nossa casa. Ainda temos muita chance de classificação. Quando estava 1 a 1 poderíamos ter feito o segundo. Eu acredito nos meus jogadores, no meu técnico, nós vamos nos classificar.      + Neymar diz que faltou maturidade ao PSG e avalia: ""Difícil, mas nada é impossível""      A partida de volta será no dia 6 de março, no Parc des Princes. Como gol fora de casa é critério de desempate, o PSG conquistará a classificação se vencer o Real Madrid por 2 a 0 em Paris.

678,1,,"Bill & Melinda Gates: Why we give our money awayChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. The authors are co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Their 2018 annual letter, from which some points in this article are adapted, is available at www.gatesletter.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs.""Is it fair that you have so much influence?""We've been asked that question more than a few times in the 18 years since we started our foundation. Our answer? No. It's not fair that we have so much wealth when billions of others have so little. And it's not fair that our wealth opens doors that are closed to most people. However, we do this work, and use whatever influence we have, to help as many people as possible and to advance equity around the world. And we are committed to being open about what we fund and what the results have been. (It's not always clear what's been successful and what hasn't, but our foundation team works hard to assess our impact, course correct and share lessons.) Although we've had some success in getting the world to pay more attention to health and extreme poverty, it would be hard to argue at this point that we made the world focus too much on them. Having influence does make it harder to get honest feedback, though. In business, your customers will tell you in an instant when you've made a mistake. It's not the same in philanthropy. Some of our critics don't speak up because they don't want to risk losing their funding from us. That's why hearing and answering tough questions is important. And it means we need to hire well, consult experts, learn constantly and seek out different viewpoints. Even though our foundation is the biggest in the world, businesses and governments spend much more than we do. California, for example, spends more than our entire endowment just to run its public school system for one year. And we use our resources in a very specific way: to test out promising innovations, collect and analyze the data and let businesses and governments scale up and sustain what works. We want to incubate lots of different ideas, and then help the best ones get out there as quickly as possible.Bill & Melinda Gates: World is getting betterBill & Melinda Gates: World is getting better There's a natural follow-up to the question about influence: ""If it's unfair that you have so much wealth, why don't you give it all to the government?"" The answer is that we think there's always going to be a unique role for foundations. They're able to take a global view to find the greatest needs, take a long-term approach to solving tough problems and manage high-risk projects that governments can't take on and corporations won't. If a government tries an idea that fails, someone wasn't doing their job -- and might lose his or her job in the next election cycle. Whereas if we don't try some ideas that fail, we're not doing our jobs.Here's another question we get a lot: ""Why are you really giving your money away -- what's in it for you?""It's not because we think about how we'll be remembered. We would be delighted if someday diseases like polio and malaria have been forgotten, and the fact that we worked on them has been, too. We do this work because it's important, it's rewarding and it's in line with how we were raised. We both come from families that believe in leaving the world better than you found it. Melinda's parents made sure their children took the social justice teachings of the Catholic Church to heart. When Melinda was in high school -- at Ursuline Academy of Dallas -- she volunteered in the public schools, tutoring students who were falling behind in math.  Bill's parents advocated for a dizzying number of important causes and local organizations in Seattle, everything from United Way and the University of Washington to school levy campaigns. Of course, these values are not unique to the two of us. Millions of people give back by volunteering their time and donating money to help others. We are, however, in the more unusual position of having a lot of money to donate. Our goal is to do what our parents taught us and do our part to improve the state of the world.The two of us have been doing this work, more or less full time, for close to two decades. That's the majority of our marriage. It's almost the entirety of our children's lives. By now the foundation's work has become inseparable from who we are. We do the work because it's our life.Join us on Twitter and FacebookWe've tried to pass on values to our children by talking with them about the foundation's work, and, as they've gotten older, taking them with us on trips so they can see it for themselves. We've spent thousands of hours learning together, meeting with scientists, educators and world leaders. Where we go, who we spend our time with, what we read and watch and listen to -- these decisions are made through the prism of our work at the foundation (when we're not watching ""The Crown"" or ""The Man in the High Castle."").Maybe 20 years ago we could have made a different choice about what to do with our wealth. But now it's impossible to imagine.

679,1,,"Candy hearts, lavish flower arrangements, and boxes of chocolate line the shelves of stores, waiting to be purchased by lovebirds for their Valentine.

But if you don't have a partner to celebrate with on February 14th — and you'd like that to change — don't despair. We've got you covered.

In the interest of bolstering your love life, here are some science-backed ways to fall and stay in love.

On a first date, get coffee, not ice cream.

Yale psychologist John Bargh has conducted a couple of studies that reveal an underlying connection between body temperature and personality.

He found that when we feel warm physically, we also tend to behave more warmly toward others. Therefore, if you want your first date to go smoothly, seek out warm places and foods — they might just help to heat things up later on.

While on that first date, be positive.

It's not all about looks.

A large 2010 study grouped over 2,100 male university students into three categories. The first group was given photos of women and asked to rate whether they found the women attractive or not. The two other groups were provided the photos along with information about the women's personalities — one group saw mostly positive information about personality traits and the other mostly negative.

The researchers discovered that the group given mostly positive personality traits found a wider variety of women attractive overall than the other two groups.

So, when you're on that first date, remember to think positively.

This may seem like a no-brainer, but listening is critical for all parts of a relationship — including the very beginning, the time after that honeymoon period has ended, and moments when inevitable conflicts arise.

A 2010 study of 373 couples from the University of Michigan found that those who were able to discuss issues calmly and listen to their partner when having an argument were less likely to separate later on than couples who didn't do this.

Psychotherapist M. Gary Neuman also told Business Insider that listening is key to falling in love because we all have a need to be heard.

O Detector de Fake News é uma extensão para o [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fake-news-detector/alomdfnfpbaagehmdokilpbjcjhacabk)

e [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fakenews-detector/)

que permite detectar e classificar direto do seu feed do Facebook as notícias

como **Legítimas**, **Fake News**, **Click Bait**, **Extremamente Tendenciosa**, **Sátira** ou **Não é notícia**.

Ao classificar uma notícia, outras pessoas que tem a extensão vão ver a sua sinalização,

ficarão mais atentas e também poderão sinalizar. Essas informações são guardadas em um

banco de dados e são lidas pelo nosso robô, o [Robinho](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/robinho).

O Robinho se baseia na informação dada por nós humanos e vai aprendendo com o tempo a classificar

automaticamente uma notícia como Fake News, Click Bait, etc, pelo seu texto. Com isso, mesmo novas

notícias que ninguém nunca viu poderão ser rapidamente classificadas.

A extensão então mostra nas notícias do seu facebook a avaliação do robô e das pessoas:Quanto mais você avalia as notícias, mais você contribui para a construção de uma base para

ensinar e melhorar o Robinho, que ainda está bem no início do seu desenvolvimento, veja, ele ainda

é um bebê robô:

## Motivação

Em 2016, durante a eleição dos Estados Unidos, muitos sites de fake news foram criados,

e propagados através das redes sociais, principalmente do Facebook. Mas foram tantos,

que as Fake News tiverammais cliques que as notícias reais. Um dos casos mais icônicos foi o de um morador da Macedônia que tinhamais de 100 sites de fake news registrados,

chegando a ganhar milhares de dólares por mês com anúncios.

A maioria desses sites era pró-Trump, por que? O Macedônio era um defensor ferrenho do Trump?

Não necessariamente! Mas ele percebeu que o eleitorado do Trump era mais sucetível a acreditar

e propagar Fake News.

Agora, em 2018, teremos eleições no Brasil, e há muitas páginas por aí que não se preocupam em

conferir as fontes e podem se aproveitar (e já estão se aproveitando) da mesma estratégia

que beneficiou Donald Trump.

Além disso, ainda temos muitas publicações extremamente tendenciosas de todos os lados e

os irritantes click-baits.

O Detector de Fake News é uma pequena iniciativa para tentar fazer alguma diferença na luta contra

esse problema, unindo a boa vontade das pessoas (Crowdsourcing) com tecnologia (Machine Learning)

## Como contribuir

Só de baixar a extensão e sinalizar as notícias você já vai estar ajudando muito! Tanto outros

usuários, quanto no desenvolvimento do Robinho.

Mas se você é programador ou cientista de dados, o Detector de Fake News é um projeto de

código aberto que precisa muito da sua ajuda! Todos os repositórios estão disponíveis em:

[https://github.com/fake-news-detector](https://github.com/fake-news-detector).

As tecnologias também são muito empolgantes: usamos Elm com WebExtensions para

a extensão, Rust para a API e Python para Machine Learning. Não conhece? Não tem problema, afinal o objetivo do

projeto é justamente aprender essas tecnologias enquanto ajuda o mundo.

Se quiser ajudar, dê uma olhada no nosso [ROADMAP](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/site/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)

(em inglês) para entender a direção do projeto, e dê uma olhada também nas

[issues do github dos projetos](https://github.com/fake-news-detector).

No desfile deste ano, a Paraíso do Tuiuti protestou contra as reformas do governo Temer, inclusive fazendo alusões absurdas à escravidão, o que de certo até banaliza o tema. Contudo, ele disse na entrevista o que o motivou a escolher esta abordagem. Quando questionado sobre o carnaval trazer mais enredos críticos, Vasconcelos respondeu:

“Eu acho que é positivo a gente poder se posicionar. Muito disso tem relação com a troca de governo. Hoje somos oposição e antes éramos parceiros do poder e não podíamos arranhar a relação. Enredo mais críticos não eram incentivados. Agora com uma guerra declarada tem essa abertura maior. Os dirigentes nos deixam livres, e temos mais é que fazer”.

Outras histórias similares foram descritas pelos jornalistas-cidadãos. Em um dos casos, um senhor desenterrou o próprio neto e canibalizou o corpo da criança para não morrer de fome.

Relatos aterrorizantes de norte-coreanos devorando pessoas para saciar a fome — em alguns casos os próprios filhos — tomaram conta do noticiário internacional nos últimos dias.

As informações expõem o desastre humanitário pelo qual o país oriental pode estar enfrentando. Os primeiros relatos foram publicados no último domingo (27) pelo diário britânico The Sunday Times. O jornal compilou o trabalho de repórteres independentes que foram enviados à Coreia do Norte pela agência de notícias Asia Press, com sede em Osaka, no Japão.A Asia Press informa que possui uma rede dos chamados “jornalistas-cidadãos” dentro da Coreia do Norte. Os “citizen journalists” (termo em inglês) são pessoas comuns que atuam como jornalistas, coletando informações e produzindo notícias.De acordo com a reportagem do Sunday Times, um homem foi recentemente fuzilado no país por ter matado e devorado seus dois filhos, no que foi descrito como um ""ataque de fome"".O diário informa ainda que a fome teria matado cerca de 10 mil pessoas no país somente em 2012.

Outras histórias similares foram descritas pelos jornalistas-cidadãos. Em um dos casos, um senhor desenterrou o próprio neto e canibalizou o corpo da criança para não morrer de fome.

Uma terceira pessoa, “enlouquecida pela fome”, diz o jornal, ferveu o próprio filho para se alimentar.As dezenas de entrevistas e relatórios coletados levaram a Asia Press a concluir que, somente em 2012, mais de 10 mil pessoas morreram por causa da fome no país comandado por Kim Jong-un.A agência de notícias asiática compilou um relatório de 12 páginas com os relatos de canibalismo no país.Um membro da empresa comentou a situação norte-coreana.— É particularmente chocante os numerosos testemunhos que nos atingem sobre os casos de canibalismo.

A solução de Bolsonaro para a Rocinha

Jair Bolsonaro deu a sua receita para resolver a guerra da Rocinha, num grande evento promovido na semana passada pelo BTG Pactual. Uma solução simples — e idiota.

A uma plateia de mil executivos do mercado financeiro, Bolsonaro disse que mandaria um helicóptero derramar milhares de folhetos sobre a favela, avisando que daria um prazo de seis horas para os bandidos se entregarem.

Findo este tempo, se a bandidagem continuasse escondida, metralharia a Rocinha.

Sinal dos tempos, foi aplaudido pelo público.

Florestan Fernandes Júnior, em seu Facebook - Nada é mais revelador da escravidão do jornalismo brasileiro que o silêncio ensurdecedor no momento em que a última ala da Paraíso do Tuiuti entrou na Marquês de Sapucaí.

O samba cresceu na avenida nos passos de foliões carregando patos amarelos, passistas desfilando com a camisa da seleção Brasileira sendo manipulados por enormes mãos midiáticas como se estivessem na Avenida Paulista. Atrás vinham as vítimas do golpe, trabalhadores exibindo a carteira de trabalho queimada pela reforma trabalhista.

possuem uma offshore nas Ilhas Virgens Britânicas. A informação é do jornal                   O Estado de S. Paulo

Na definição da organização Transparência Internacional, uma                   offshore

trata-se de uma “sociedade limitada que não tem presença física na jurisdição, não tem funcionários e não tem atividade comercial”. Comumente abertas em paraísos fiscais, as offshores exigem pouca documentação sobre a origem do dinheiro, além de dificultar o rastreamento de seus beneficiários. São, por isso, costumeiramente utilizadas para lavar dinheiro e ocultar patrimônio.

Os documentos foram encontrados em São Paulo na sede da empresa Nutrimental, do pai de Rocha Loures, que produz barras de cereal. A empresa foi alvo de mandato de busca e apreensão após a divulgação do vídeo em que o ex-deputado e ex-assessor de                   Michel Temer

aparece recebendo uma mala contendo R$500 mil reais.

O dinheiro foi entregue a Loures por um dos diretores da JBS, Ricardo Saud, e era supostamente destinado ao presidente Michel Temer.

O ex-deputado Rodrigo Rocha Loures, que foi também assessor especial do presidente Michel Temer, negou que tenha atuado em favor da Rodrimar, empresa que opera o Porto de Santos, e disse não ter relação de amizade com Temer.

As declarações foram feitas em depoimentos prestados em novembro à Polícia Federal no âmbito do  inquérito do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) que apura supostos crimes envolvendo o decreto dos Portos, assinado pelo presidente em maio do ano passado.

De acordo com a Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR), Temer teria recebido propina por intermédio de Rocha Loures para favorecer ilegalmente a empresa.  O inquérito é relatado no STF pelo ministro Luís Roberto Barroso e é o único processo contra o presidente que está em andamento atualmente.

Loures fez questão de inocentar Temer em seus depoimentos à PF, afirmando desconhecer qualquer ligação do presidente com o setor portuário. Segundo reportou o jornal Folha de S. Paulo, o ex-assessor também declarou que tinha com o presidente uma ""relação de trabalho amistosa, não podendo afirmar que fosse uma relação de amizade"".

720,3,1.0,"Não quer passar vergonha no LinkedIn? Veja erros crassos que você deve evitar a todo custo na rede social profissional

Importante plataforma de conteúdo e relacionamento profissional, o LinkedIn registrou a marca de 23 milhões de usuários brasileiros no fim do ano passado.

Apesar da sua grande popularidade no país – somos o 3º maior público da plataforma no mundo, atrás de Estados Unidos e Índia – a rede social ainda desperta dúvidas em muitas pessoas. Até naquelas que já têm perfis no site há anos.

Isso quer dizer que os usuários ainda cometem muitos erros no LinkedIn? Para Fernanda Brunsizian, gerente de comunicação da empresa para a América Latina, a resposta é negativa. Segundo ela, não existe um jeito correto ou incorreto de usar a plataforma.

“Existem apenas atitudes que são proibidas, isto é, que ferem as normas do site, e aquelas que não ajudam o usuário a conquistar seus objetivos profissionais”, afirma.

Na visão de Dan Sherman, autor do livro “Obtendo o Máximo do LinkedIn” (Editora M. Books), não saber “se vender” é o principal erro estratégico dos usuários. O especialista defende que o perfil na rede social seja visto como uma peça de publicidade sobre a sua carreira.

“É um anúncio de você mesmo, quem você é, o que pode fazer e como pode fazer a diferença em uma empresa”, afirmou Sherman em entrevista exclusiva a EXAME.com.

Ainda assim, expor-se pouco, escrever textos prolixos, omitir certos detalhes pessoais e não listar as suas competências são equívocos táticos no LinkedIn – mas não são erros crassos.

Por outro lado, existem atitudes que realmente podem comprometer o seu aproveitamento e a sua reputação profissional no LinkedIn. Veja cinco delas a seguir:

1. Desconhecer os termos de uso do site

Segundo Fernanda Brunsizian, gerente de comunicação do LinkedIn para a América Latina, não são poucos os usuários brasileiros com perfis incompatíveis com o regulamento do site.

Há muita gente que cria perfis pessoais para empresas – que deveriam ter “company pages”, o formato adequado de página para pessoas jurídicas.

Outro problema frequente é ter contas duplicadas: o usuário esquece que fez um perfil no passado e cria outro com a mesma identidade. O passo a passo para identificar e resolver o problema está neste tutorial da rede social.

Discursos de ódio ou qualquer forma de discriminação também são veementemente proibidos pelos termos de uso e acarretam punições.

Cuidar da sua reputação online é uma obrigação no mundo atual: chefes, colegas e recrutadores estão de olho nas redes sociais e muitas vezes constroem a imagem de um profissional a partir do seu perfil na internet.

A preocupação com o idioma é fundamental para a construção da sua reputação no LinkedIn, afirma Brunsizian. Erros de português, dos mais sutis aos mais graves, podem comprometer a sua credibilidade no mercado e até afastar oportunidades profissionais.

A atenção à norma culta da língua é obrigatória em qualquer forma de interação na rede social. Seja em textos escritos no seu perfil pessoal, mensagens privadas ou publicações em grupos de discussão, é importante fazer uma rápida revisão e eliminar qualquer deslize linguístico antes de apertar o botão “enviar”.

Outro erro crasso é acreditar que os dados sobre você no LinkedIn podem ser forjados sem grandes consequências. Criar ou distorcer fatos é uma prática tão desaconselhável no site quanto seria em um currículo.

“Não vale a pena citar cursos, projetos ou faculdades que você não fez”, diz a gerente de comunicação da empresa para a América Latina. “Cedo ou tarde, os fatos vão ser checados pelo recrutador”.

Além de ser ineficaz, a mentira acarreta sérios danos à imagem de um profissional. A falta de transparência é citada como um dos maiores pecados de um candidato na visão de 10 recrutadores ouvidos por EXAME.com.

Segundo dados oficiais do LinkedIn, perfis com foto são 14 vezes mais clicados do que aqueles que não têm imagem nenhuma. O detalhe traz credibilidade e uma sensação de proximidade com o usuário em questão.

Dada a grande importância da foto, é perigoso negligenciar a sua qualidade ou pertinência para o contexto profissional. Alguns vacilos são evidentes: não dá para usar uma foto em que você apareça na praia, com um copo de cerveja na mão, por exemplo. Mas Fernanda também não recomenda cortar o seu rosto de uma foto em grupo, por exemplo, o que traz a sensação de que o usuário fez uma escolha casual e despreocupada do próprio avatar.

“O ideal é tirar uma foto especialmente para o perfil no LinkedIn ou usar uma imagem pronta que mostre claramente o seu rosto, sem acessórios como óculos ou chapéus, com um ambiente neutro no fundo”, orienta ela.

Em setembro de 2015, um diálogo entre dois advogados britânicos no LinkedIn se tornou um escândalo mundial. Alexander Carter-Silk enviou uma cantada pela rede social para sua colega de profissão Charlotte Proudman – que reagiu à altura e expos o caso na imprensa internacional. “Isso não é Tinder”, disse ela à BBC.

Segundo Fernanda Brunsizian, gerente do LinkedIn, a tentativa imprópria de usar a rede como plataforma de relacionamento não é tão comum entre os usuários brasileiros – mas é uma atitude altamente desaconselhada.

O problema não é apenas confundir o LinkedIn com apps de paquera como o Tinder. O erro é usá-lo sem levar em conta a sua natureza de rede social profissional.

Falar sobre política, por exemplo, não é proibido – mas é preciso calibrar o tom para não desvirtuar a discussão. “Você pode expor o seu ponto de vista sobre a política nacional, desde que a sua análise tenha alguma conexão com a sua área ou com o mundo dos negócios”, diz Fernanda. O que não se pode fazer é perder a postura exigida em qualquer conversa profissional.

721,1,,"Um projeto em tramitação no Senado Federal pretende obrigar que empresas responsáveis por sites e aplicativos de redes sociais garantam a autorização do usuário antes que ele seja incluído em um novo grupo ou evento. O texto altera o Marco Civil da Internet e prevê advertência e multa em caso de descumprimento.

A norma seria aplicada, por exemplo, a contas e páginas no Facebook, WhatsApp e Telegram.

O PLS (projeto de lei do Senado) 347/2016, de autoria da senadora Vanessa Grazziotin (PCdoB-AM), foi aprovado no último dia 7 pela CCJ (Comissão de Constituição, Justiça e Cidadania) e agora segue para votação final na CCT (Comissão de Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovação, Comunicação e Informática).

No texto, a senadora diz que a mudança é necessária porque ""há redes sociais que possibilitam aos membros a inclusão de outros usuários em grupos, páginas, comunidades e similares, sem a autorização prévia do incluído - ambientes estes muitas vezes com conteúdo agressivo, pornográfico, ou simplesmente desinteressante ao usuário adicionado, que em momento algum foi questionado sobre o interesse em participar de tais espaços"".

Apesar da aparente boa intenção da proposta, especialistas ouvidos pelo UOL dizem que o projeto não é necessário, já que é possível sair voluntariamente desses ambientes indesejados, e ainda poderia criar novas dificuldades para empresas e internautas.

""Hoje já existem ferramentas que possibilitam ao usuário sair do grupo, denunciar spam, dizer que não quer receber mais convites de determinadas páginas ou pessoas"", afirma o advogado Rony Vainzof. ""Pode parecer interessante a ideia de ter que receber um convite prévio para participar de um grupo, mas isso seria aplicável na prática? O que teria que constar nesse consentimento?"", questiona.

No texto do projeto, uma das justificativas para a alteração é evitar que empresas utilizem dados dos usuários sem autorização. Isso porque, segundo o projeto, algumas redes sociais, de forma não autorizada, ""acessam a lista de contatos de seus membros para atrair novos usuários, convidando integrantes dessa lista, em nome dos respectivos membros, a ingressarem na rede"".

Para Carlos Affonso Souza, diretor do ITS Rio (Instituto de Tecnologia e Sociedade do Rio de Janeiro), o projeto não ataca o problema e desvia o foco da discussão. ""A Casa deveria estar concentrada na aprovação da lei de proteção de dados pessoais [PLS 330/2013], que torna mais clara a proibição da venda de dados, tanto na internet quanto fora dela"", diz.

É uma escolha de prioridades desafortunada que os nossos senadores passem um tempo discutindo o regime de convites quando poderiam estar discutindo lei de dados no Brasil"" Carlos Affonso Souza

O PLS 330/2013 está na CAE (Comissão de Assuntos Econômicos) aguardando parecer do relator, o senador Sérgio de Castro (PDT-ES).

Na CCJ, o projeto da senadora Vanessa Grazziotin recebeu duas emendas do relator Romero Jucá (PMDB-RR).

A primeira mudança retira do texto a responsabilidade do usuário que adicionou outro sem autorização. Para Jucá, ""a culpa pela ausência de mecanismos que asseguram a coleta do consentimento prévio é da aplicação, e não dos usuários"".

A segunda emenda diz respeito à garantia de dano moral em caso de inclusão do usuário sem consentimento prévio. ""Hoje é discutível se existe dano moral em casos como esse e, se existir dano, talvez não seja indenizável. Isso porque os tribunais brasileiros já decidiram que 'mero aborrecimento não gera dano moral' e esse caso é o típico caso de mero aborrecimento. Então, o que o senador [Romero Jucá] fez com a mudança do texto foi tentar forçar que o Judiciário reconheça o dano"", diz Souza.

""Isso não quer dizer que um dano nesses ambientes não possa acontecer. Você pode ser inserido em um grupo e se sentir ofendido por algo, mas hoje é possível mover uma ação indenizatória contra a pessoa que te incluiu. Para isso, não é preciso obrigar as aplicações a desenvolverem um sistema que burocratiza todos os grupos só para resolver o caso de 0,0001%"", afirma o diretor do ITS Rio.

724,2,,"I metodi sono incredibilmente sadici (lo scopo principale è quello di traumatizzare la vittima), ed i risultati sono raccapriccianti: la creazione di una schiavo mentalmente controllato, che può essere attivato in qualsiasi momento per eseguire qualsiasi azione richiesta dal gestore (handler). Mentre i mass media ignorano il problema, oltre 2 milioni di americani hanno subito gli orrori di questa programmazione. Questo articolo esamina le origini della programmazione Monarch, alcuni dei suoi metodi e il simbolismo. La programmazione Monarch è una tecnica di controllo mentale che comprende elementi del Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) e del disturbo di personalità multipla (MPD). Si utilizza una combinazione di psicologia, neuroscienze e rituali occulti per creare all’interno degli schiavi un alter ego che può essere attivato ??e programmato dai gestori. Gli schiavi della programmazione Monarch vengono utilizzati da varie organizzazioni collegate con l’élite mondiale in settori come: l’esercito, la schiavitù sessuale e l’industria dell’intrattenimento. In questo articolo daremo un occhio alle origini della programmazione Monarch, alle sue tecniche e al suo simbolismo.

Uno dei primi studi sulla metodica del controllo mentale basato sul trauma sono state condotte da Josef Mengele, medico che lavorava in campi di concentramento nazisti. Inizialmente acquisì notorietà per essere stato uno dei medici delle SS che curò la selezione dei prigionieri in arrivo, determinando chi doveva essere ucciso e che sarebbe diventato un operaio per i lavori forzati. Tuttavia, egli è noto soprattutto per aver condotto degli esperimenti macabri sugli esseri umani all’interno dei campi di concentramento. Mengele conduceva esperimenti pure sui bambini, motivo per il quale venne chiamato “L’angelo della Morte”.

Mengele non gode di stima per i suoi sordidi esperimenti sui prigionieri dei campi di concentramento, in particolare sui gemelli. Una parte del suo lavoro, menzionata raramente, è la ricerca sul controllo della mente. Gran parte di essa è stata confiscata dagli Alleati ed è ancora classificata ai nostri giorni.

“Il Dr. Joseph Mengele, conosciuto ad Auschwitz, fu il principale promotore del Progetto Monarch, basato sul trauma, e dei programmi MkUltra della CIA. Mengele e circa 5, 000 altri nazisti di alto rango sono stati segretamente trasferiti negli Stati Uniti e nel Sud America all’indomani della seconda guerra mondiale in una Operazione progettata dalla Paperclip. I nazisti hanno continuato la loro opera nello sviluppo di tecnologie di controllo mentale e missilistica in segreto nelle basi sotterranee militari. L’unica cosa che c’è stata detta era che il lavoro di progettazione missilistica era portato avanti in collaborazione con l’ex celebrità nazista Warner Von Braun. Gli assassini, i torturatori, i mutilatori che hanno spezzato migliaia di vite sono stati discretamente tenuti da parte, occupando comunque le basi sotterranee militari degli Stati Uniti che a poco a poco sono diventate la dimora di migliaia e migliaia di bambini americani rapiti dalle strade (circa un milione l’anno) e messi in gabbie di ferro impilate dal pavimento al soffitto come parte della “rieducazione”. Questi bambini sarebbero stati utilizzati per affinare e perfezionare ulteriormente le tecnologie sul controllo mentale di Mengele. Alcuni bambini selezionati (almeno quelli che sopravvivevano alla ‘rieducazione’), sarebbero diventati gli schiavi controllati mentalmente del futuro che sarebbero poi stati utilizzati in migliaia di lavori diversi che vanno dalla schiavitù sessuale agli omicidi. Una parte consistente di questi bambini, che erano considerati materiali di consumo, sono stati abbattuti intenzionalmente di fronte (e da) altri bambini, al fine di traumatizzare il tirocinante selezionato in totale rispetto e sottomissione. 2

Anche se non c’è mai stata alcuna ammissione ufficiale dell’esistenza della programmazione Monarch, eminenti ricercatori hanno documentato l’uso sistematico del trauma in soggetti per scopi di controllo mentale. Alcuni sopravvissuti, con l’aiuto di terapisti dedicati, sono stati in grado di “deprogrammare” se stessi per andare poi a registrare e divulgare i dettagli raccapriccianti delle loro traversie.

Gli schiavi Monarch sono principalmente utilizzati dalle organizzazioni per effettuare operazioni mediante capri espiatori addestrati a svolgere compiti specifici, che non contestino gli ordini, che non ricordino le loro azioni e che, se scoperti, si suicidino automaticamente. Sono il capro espiatorio perfetto per gli omicidi di alto profilo (vedi Sirhan Sirhan), candidate ideali per la prostituzione, per la schiavitù sessuale e della pornografia snuff. Sono anche perfette marionette per l’industria dell’intrattenimento che fa di loro delle star.

“Quello che posso dire è che oggi la programmazione rituale basata sull’abuso è molto diffusa, è sistematica, si organizza attraverso le conoscenze esoteriche che non sono scritte, o pubblicate su qualsiasi libro o dette in un talk show, ma che vediamo costantemente aggirarsi in tutto il paese.

“La programmazione basata sul trauma può essere definita come la tortura sistematica che blocca la capacità di elaborazione cosciente della vittima (attraverso il dolore, il terrore, la droga, l’illusione, la privazione sensoriale o l’eccesso di stimolazione sensoriale, la diminuzione dell’ossigeno, il freddo, il caldo, la stimolazione cerebrale e, spesso, con esperienze di pre-morte), e che impiega poi suggerimenti e / o condizionamenti classici e operanti (in coerenza con i principi consolidati della modificazione comportamentale) per impiantare i pensieri, le direttive e le percezioni nella mente inconscia, nelle nuove identità, che forzano la vittima a fare, sentire, pensare o percepire le cose, agli scopi del programmatore. L’obiettivo è che la vittima segua le direttive senza consapevolezza, compresi gli atti che sono in palese violazione con la morale o i principi del soggetto.

L’installazione della programmazione per il controllo mentale si basa sulla capacità della vittima di dissociarsi, che consente la creazione di nuovi personaggi indipendenti l’un l’altro che sono i veicoli con cui la programmazione si attua in maniera segreta. I bambini dissociati sono i primi “candidati” per questo genere di programmazione“. 5

Il controllo mentale Monarch è chiamato in questo modo in riferimento alla farfalla Monarca – un insetto che comincia la sua vita come un verme (che rappresenta il potenziale non sviluppato) e, dopo un periodo nel bozzolo (programmazione) rinasce come splendida farfalla (lo schiavo Monarch). Alcune caratteristiche specifiche per la farfalla monarca, sono applicabili anche al controllo mentale.

“Uno dei motivi principali per cui la programmazione Monarch ha assunto questo nome fù la farfalla monarca. La farfalla monarca impara dove è nata (radici) e passa questa conoscenza genetica ai suoi discendenti (di generazione in generazione). Questo è stato uno degli animali che ha fatto tacere gli scienziati, rendendo scientifico il fatto che il sapere possa essere trasmesso geneticamente. Il programma Monarch si basa sugli obiettivi Nazisti/Illuminati di creare una razza superiore, in parte attraverso la genetica. Se la conoscenza può essere trasmessa geneticamente (ed è così), allora è importante che vengano trovati i corretti genitori che possano passare la corretta conoscenza a quelle vittime selezionate per il controllo mentale Monarch“. 6

“Quando una persona sta subendo traumi indotti da elettroshock, è provato che essa subisce una sensazione di leggera vertigine, come se si sentisse sospeso o fluttuante come una farfalla. Vi è anche una rappresentazione simbolica relativa alla trasformazione o alla metamorfosi di questo bell’insetto: da un bruco in un bozzolo (dormienza, inattività), ad una farfalla (nuova creazione), che ritorna al suo punto di origine. Tale è il modello migratorio che rende questa specie unica"". 7

La vittima viene chiamata “schiavo” da parte del programmatore / gestore, che a sua volta è percepito come un “maestro” o “Dio”. Circa il 75% è di sesso femminile, in quanto in possesso di una maggiore tolleranza al dolore e perché tendono a dissociarsi più facilmente rispetto ai maschi. Gli Handler della programmazione Monarch cercano di dividere in comparti la psiche del soggetto, creando personalità multiple usando il condizionamento basato sul trauma.

16. Allucinogeni, per creare confusione e amnesia, somministrate per iniezione o per via endovenosa

24. Stuprare una donna per metterla incinta, viene quindi fatta abortire e il feto viene utilizzato a scopo rituale, o se la gravidanza non viene interrotta, il bambino viene rapito per essere una vittima sacrificale o diventare uno schiavo.

“La base per il successo della programmazione Monarch è che possono essere create differenti personalità o parti di personalità, che non si conoscono tra loro, ma che possono prendere il controllo del corpo in momenti diversi. Le pareti di amnesia costruite grazie ai traumi, formano uno scudo protettivo di segretezza che protegge i colpevoli dall’essere scoperti, e impedisce alla personalità principale di sapere quando il sistema di cambio personalità è attivo. Lo scudo del segreto permette ai membri del culto di vivere e di lavorare assieme agli altri e di rimanere totalmente inosservati. La personalità dominante potrebbe essere un buonissimo cristiano, ma la personalità che si nasce sotto di essa potrebbe essere più satanica di quella di Mr. Hyde (Guardatevi BTK Bind Torture Kill). Si cerca di fare molto sotto il profilo del mantenimento della segretezza della agenzia di intelligence o del gruppo occulto che sta controllando lo schiavo. Il tasso di successo di questo tipo di programmazione è alto, ma quando fallisce, i fallimenti vengono eliminati attraverso la morte. Ogni trauma e tortura serve a uno scopo. Una grande quantità di sperimentazioni e ricerca furono condotti per sapere cosa poteva essere fatto e cosa no. Vennero elaborati grafici con i dati statistici su quanto si potesse torturare un corpo di un dato peso e di una data età senza che tale individuo morisse"". 9

“A causa del grave trauma indotto dalla terapia elettroconvulsiva, dagli abusi sessuali e da altri metodi, la mente si divide in personaggi differenti dal principale. Precedentemente indicato come Disturbo di Personalità Multipla, è attualmente riconosciuto come Disturbo dissociativo di identità ed è la base per la programmazione Monarch. Il condizionamento della mente della vittima viene ulteriormente rafforzato attraverso l’ipnosi, la coercizione a doppio legame, inversioni tra piacere e dolore, privazioni di cibo, acqua, sonno e sensoriale, insieme a vari farmaci che modificano alcune funzioni cerebrali “. 10

La dissociazione viene quindi ottenuta traumatizzando il soggetto, utilizzando l’abuso sistematico e rituali occulti terrificanti. Una volta che la scissione della personalità di base si verifica, un “mondo interno” può essere creato e nuovi alterego possono essere programmati utilizzando strumenti quali la musica, i film (soprattutto le produzioni Disney) e le fiabe. Questi ausili visivi e audio rafforzano il processo di programmazione con immagini, simboli, significati e concetti. Gli alterego appena creati possono essere attivati con le parole di attivazione o con dei simboli con cui è stata programmata la psiche del soggetto dal gestore. Alcune delle immagini più comuni interne viste dagli schiavi del controllo mentale sono gli alberi, l’Albero Cabalistico della Vita, loop infiniti, antichi simboli e lettere, ragnatele, specchi, vetri rotti, maschere, castelli, labirinti, demoni, farfalle, clessidre, orologi e robot. Questi simboli sono comunemente inseriti nei film della cultura popolare e nei video per due motivi: per desensibilizzare la maggioranza della popolazione, utilizzando i messaggi subliminali e la programmazione neuro-linguistica e di costruire deliberatamente specifici trigger e chiavi per la programmazione di base per i bambini “monarch” altamente impressionabili. 11 Alcuni dei film utilizzati per la programmazione Monarch includono Il mago di Oz, Alice nel paese delle meraviglie, Pinocchio e la Bella Addormentata.

In ogni caso, allo schiavo viene fornita una particolare interpretazione della trama del film, al fine di migliorare la programmazione. Ad esempio, ad uno schiavo che guarda Il mago di Oz viene insegnato che “Somewhere Over The Rainbow”è il “luogo felice” dove le vittime del controllo Monarch devono andare per sfuggire al dolore insopportabile che gli affligge. Utilizzando il film, i programmatori incoraggiano gli schiavi ad andare “oltre all’arcobaleno” dissociandosi, separando in modo efficace le loro menti dai loro corpi.

“Come accennato prima, l’ipnotizzatore troverà più facile ipnotizzare i bambini se ci sa fare con loro. Un metodo che è efficace è quello di dire ai bambini piccoli, “Immagina di guardare il tuo programma tv preferito”. Questo è il motivo per cui i film della Disney e gli altri show per i piccoli sono così importanti per i programmatori. Essi sono lo strumento ipnotico ideale per ottenere la dissociazione mentale del bambino. I programmatori hanno utilizzato i film fin dall’inizio per far imparare ai piccoli gli script ipnotici. I bambini hanno bisogno di sentirsi parte del processo ipnotico. Se l’ipnotista permette al bambino di costruirsi il suo immaginario personale, le suggestioni ipnotiche saranno più forti. Piuttosto di dire il colore del cane, il programmatore può chiederlo direttamente al bambino. E’ proprio in questo aspetto che i libri e i film proiettati assistono il bambino nel focalizzare la giusta direzione da intraprendere con la sua psiche. Se l’ipnotista parla con il bambino, dovrà prendere delle precauzioni extra per non cambiare il tono della voce e avere transizioni morbide. La maggior parte dei film della Disney sono utilizzati ai fini della programmazione. Alcuni di essi sono progettati specificatamente per il controllo della mente“. 12

La DELTA è nota come programmazione “killer” ed è stata originariamente sviluppata per l’addestramento degli agenti speciali o dei soldati d’elite (cioè la Delta Force, il First Earth Battalion, il Mossad, ecc) nelle operazioni di infiltrazione. L’ottima risposta adrenalinica e l’aggressività controllata sono evidenti. I soggetti sono privi di paura e sono molto sistematici nello svolgimento delle loro assegnazioni. Istruzioni come il suicidio sono stratificate in a questo livello.

THETA. Viene considerata una programmazione psichica. I bloodliners (cioè coloro che discendono da famiglie di tradizione satanista) hanno una propensione psichica, sconosciuta a chi non appartiene alle loro casate, utilizzando la telepatia. Tuttavia, dati i limiti intrinseci di questo tipo di controllo mentale vennero introdotti svariati sistemi elettronici, come impianti cerebrali che sfruttano le tecnologie laser ed elettromagnetiche. È noto che essi vengono utilizzati in abbinamento a super computer e a satelliti di geolocazione. 13

È difficile rimanere obiettivi descrivendo gli orrori subiti dagli schiavi Monarch. L’estrema violenza, l’abuso sessuale, la tortura mentale e i giochi sadici inflitti alle vittime da “rinomati scienziati” e da funzionari di alto livello dimostrano l’esistenza di un vero e proprio “lato oscuro” del potere. Nonostante le rivelazioni, i documenti e i whistle blowers, la grande maggioranza della popolazione ignora, respinge o evita il problema del tutto. Oltre due milioni di americani sono stati programmati dal condizionamento basato sul trauma dal 1947 e la CIA ha ammesso pubblicamente i propri progetti sul controllo mentale nel 1970. Film come The Manchurian Candidate fanno riferimento direttamente al soggetto della discussione che sto portando avanti, raffigurando le tecniche di tortura, come l’elettroshock, l’uso di parole “attivatrici” e l’implementazione del microchip nelle nostre vite. Diversi personaggi pubblici che vediamo nei nostri schermi tv e nei film sono schiavi del controllo mentale. Personaggi famosi, da Candy Jones, a Celia Imrie a Sirhan Sirhan sono uscite allo scoperto e hanno raccontato le loro esperienze di vittime del controllo mentale … ma ancora il pubblico rivendica l’idea che “sia tutto una finzione”.

La ricerca e i fondi investiti nel progetto Monarch non vennero spesi solo per le vittime del controllo Monarch. Molte delle tecniche della programmazione messe a punto in questi esperimenti vengono applicati su una scala mondiale attraverso i mass media. I video musicali, le notizie dei media ufficiali, i film, le pubblicità e i programmi televisivi sono concepiti utilizzando i dati più avanzati sul comportamento umano a disposizione. Molti di questi provengono dalla programmazione Monarch.

730,1,,"The stock market went on a wild ride again on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 1,175 points, its worst point drop in history. The Dow closed down 4.6 percent and turned negative for the year.

At one point Monday afternoon, the Dow was down 1,579 points — the largest intraday point drop in the history of the index.

""Investors were dumping out of stocks,"" NPR's Uri Berliner reports. ""They were in free fall, something we've seen very little of during the steady bull market since basically 2009. And now we're seeing nerves in the market — some fear.""

The previous largest point drop for the Dow was 778 points in September 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis.

Market participants were focused on the threat of higher inflation after Friday's jobs report showed a pickup in wages, which portends more interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.

""I think we are in a changing environment where it looks like we're going to have a bit higher inflation and so that has markets on edge,"" Gus Faucher, chief economist of the PNC Financial Services Group, told NPR's Windsor Johnston.  ""And I think volatility is likely to be higher in 2018 than it was in 2017.""

Analysts suggest that program trading caused the wild sell-off, NPR's John Ydstie reported. ""As quickly as the market fell, it recovered much of the ground it had lost as investors remembered the economy and corporate earnings remain strong,"" he added.

The Dow closed at 24,345.75. Monday's losses came on top of Friday's 666-point drop in the blue-chip index, which resulted in the worst week for the index in two years.

Other major stock indexes also fell Monday, with the S&P 500 down 113 points, or 4.1 percent, and the Nasdaq down 273 points, or 3.8 percent.

Many financial professionals say this sell-off is healthy for the market. Stock prices letting off steam is ""better than if they continue to rise and then pop like a balloon that's overinflated,"" Berliner says. ""But if fear takes over the market then it could get quite ugly.""

In the past week, both the Dow and the S&P 500 have now lost over 5 percent from their recent all-time highs.

Stock indexes around the world also fell Monday, including London's FTSE 100, which closed down 1.5 percent, and Japan's Nikkei, which fell 2.5 percent.

735,1,,"US entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched his new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The mammoth vehicle - the most powerful since the shuttle system - lifted clear of its pad without incident to soar high over the Atlantic Ocean.

It was billed as a risky test flight in advance of the lift-off.

The SpaceX CEO said the challenges of developing the new rocket meant the chances of a successful first outing might be only 50-50.

""I had this image of just a giant explosion on the pad, a wheel bouncing down the road. But fortunately that's not what happened,"" he told reporters after the event.

With this debut, the Falcon Heavy becomes the most capable launch vehicle available.

It is designed to deliver a maximum payload to low-Earth orbit of 64 tonnes - the equivalent of putting five London double-decker buses in space.

Such performance is slightly more than double that of the world's next most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy - but at one third of the cost, says Mr Musk.

For this experimental and uncertain mission, however, he decided on a much smaller and whimsical payload - his old cherry-red Tesla sports car.

A space-suited mannequin was strapped in the driver's seat, and the radio set to play a David Bowie soundtrack on a loop.

The Tesla and its passenger have been despatched into an elliptical orbit around the Sun that reaches out as far as the Planet Mars.

The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 vehicles strapped together. And, as is the usual practice for SpaceX, all three boost stages - the lower segments of the rocket - returned to Earth to attempt controlled landings.

Two came back to touchdown zones on the Florida coast just south of Kennedy. Their landing legs made contact with the ground virtually at the same time.

""That was epic,"" said Mr Musk. ""That's probably the most exciting thing I've ever seen, literally.""

The third booster was due to settle on a drone ship stationed several hundred kilometres out at sea. Unfortunately, it was unable to slow its descent by re-igniting sufficient engines, missed the target vessel and was destroyed as it hit the water at some 500km/h.

By then, the upper-stage of the Falcon Heavy, with its Tesla cargo, was heading on a trajectory that would hopefully take it towards Mars' orbit.

That required the engine on the upper-stage to fire on three separate occasions, with the third and final ignition only occurring after a long cruise phase - something which was confirmed some six hours after the launch.

Having such a large and powerful rocket should open up some fascinating new possibilities for Mr Musk and his SpaceX company. These include launching:

* Much bigger satellites for use by US intelligence and the military. The scale of these satellites is limited by current rocket performance.

* Large batches of satellites, such as those for Mr Musk's proposed constellation of thousands of spacecraft to deliver broadband across the globe.

* Bigger, more capable robots to go to the surface of Mars, or to visit the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, and their moons.

* Huge telescopes. Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is having to be folded origami-like to fit in its launcher next year.

But it is the low cost - brought about through the recovery and reuse of the boosters - that Elon Musk believes will be a game-changer when allied to the new performance.

""It'll be game-over for all other heavy-lift rockets,"" he told reporters on Monday.

""It'll be like trying to sell an aircraft where one aircraft company has a reusable aircraft and all the other companies had aircraft that were single-use where you would parachute out at your destination and the plane would crash-land randomly somewhere. Crazy as that sounds - that's how the rocket business works.""

738,2,,"According to officials, the Pentagon has started planning a grand military parade.

After Trump witnessed the Bastille Day celebrations in France, he has been interested in displaying America’s military strength.

The tipping point for such a parade happened after a January 18th meeting with Trump and the top generals, where they heard Trump’s wishes as “presidential directive.”

The military official who asked to remain anonymous stated, “The marching orders were: I want a parade like the one in France. This is being worked at the highest levels of the military.”

However, this parade that would showcase the military’s strength would come with a hefty price. The cost of shipping tanks and high-tech equipment to Washington cost could millions. Military officials are unsure how it would be paid.

Currently, there is no date set for the parade. However, officials have noted that Trump wants the parade to be tied to a patriotic holiday. Trump’s officials have considered having the parade on May 28th and July 4th but the Pentagon wants it on Veterans Day.

The location for the parade is also up in the air. Trump has stated he would like the parade to take place on Pennsylvania Avenue.

739,4,,"He’s waffled on the question so far, alternating between saying he’s “looking forward” to testifying and the more cryptic, “Certainly I’ll see what happens.”

But according to a New York Times report Monday, some of the president’s lawyers and advisers are recommending he decline Mueller’s upcoming interview request.

As the Times noted, the move would be both a legal and political gamble that could stretch out the Russia probe deep into 2018 — and perhaps even beyond. But it could also be the only way to protect Trump from getting himself into legal peril.

Since May, when Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey, Mueller has been conducting a multipronged investigation related to Russia’s 2016 election interference. Two of the fronts that concern Trump are the question of whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin and the question of whether he attempted to obstruct justice at any point during the course of the probe.

That second question has been of increasing focus for Mueller, who is reportedly interested in asking Trump about the firing of Comey and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. He also seems particularly interested in the misleading statement Trump reportedly helped craft aboard Air Force One in summer 2017 on behalf of his son to explain a shady 2016 meeting between top members of his campaign and a Kremlin-connected lawyer believed to have dirt on Democrat Hillary Clinton.

But Trump’s legal team has long been wary of allowing the president to do a face-to-face interview with the special counsel’s office, fearing that his famous propensity to lie and exaggerate could get him into legal trouble. As Fox News’ Andrew Napolitano has warned, putting the president in front of the special counsel could be a “perjury trap.”

“It only takes a couple of slip-ups for them to say to his lawyers, ‘We caught your client in a lie. Do you want us to present this to a grand jury and see if they indict him?’ That would be catastrophic for the president. Don’t give them that opportunity,” Napolitano said Tuesday. “Don’t help them prosecute you.”

But declining to be interviewed could trigger a lengthy — and messy — legal battle between Trump and Mueller, according to the Times. Mueller could issue a grand jury subpoena to Trump, possibly leading to a Supreme Court fight. It could also further imply that he has something to hide; Democrats, and even some Republicans, have raised questions about why the president has demonstrated such hostility toward investigators.

Trump has continued to insist that the suggestion of any wrongdoing on his part is nothing but a “hoax,” saying over the weekend that the memo released by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Friday “totally vindicates” him. Carter Page, the campaign aide that the memo claims was improperly surveilled by federal investigators, has said he was also vindicated by Nunes.

But outside the most pro-Trump circles, the memo has appeared to be every bit the dud some in the White House privately feared it would be. It suffered from a number of credibility issues, undercut its own argument and didn’t appear to negatively impact the way Americans see the Russia probe.

Now, following a unanimous vote in the House Intelligence Committee on Monday, the president will face pressure to release a Democratic rebuttal to the Nunes memo that may further poke holes in his argument that there’s anti-Trump conspiracy afoot in the FBI and Department of Justice, which some feared he’d use to justify terminating Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — who was named in the four-page Nunes report — or Mueller.

Democrats have warned Trump that doing so would result in a “constitutional crisis,” and several Republicans — including Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S. C.), who helped pen the GOP memo — have said the Nunes report doesn’t have “any impact on the Russia probe” and that the president shouldn’t see it as an excuse to interfere with it.

So, with the investigation speeding ahead for now, the president will have to decide if he’ll cooperate with the special counsel or escalate the battle against him.

According to the Times, some of Trump’s legal staff and advisers both in and outside of the White House believe Mueller hasn’t demonstrated sufficient reason to question him and that the president can win a fight with the special counsel in the courts.

But other legal experts believe that precedent is not on the president’s side here, and that resisting Mueller’s request for testimony would be difficult.

“The upshot of the Nixon tapes case was that any president is going to have an extremely hard time resisting a request from a law enforcement officer,” Neal K. Katyal, an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, told the Times on Monday. “In general ... presidents do sit for interviews or respond to requests from prosecutors because they take their constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws seriously, and running away from a prosecutor isn’t consistent with faithfully executing the laws.”

Upon walking into the orientation area for the dog sledding it is apparent that in the forest there are hundreds of dogs that are chained up to a post to live in the same spot they use the washroom and sleep. I proceeded to ask if the dogs were ever let off the chains to go in a shelter or somewhere warm during the night, and the worker told me that this is where they stay all day and all night. She also told me that there were around 120 dogs in total. Outside chained up to posts.

The dogs were extremely scared when walking up to them and some of them were sick, starving, and injured. It was shocking. When petting the dogs they were so not used to affection and they would not want me or my girlfriend to leave them because of the lack of attention they get.

In conclusion I'm not going Yeah to let this go; as this is mass cruelty towards harmless and innocent animals. This place needs to get shut down.

Shut down the Bandung Zoo now!0 have signed. Let’s get to 1,000,000. Sun Bears kept in the Bandung Zoo are so hungry they eat their own feces. One of the zoo’s giraffes suddenly died and was found to have 40 pounds of plastic trash in its stomach. The Bandung Zoo has been coined Indonesia’s “death zoo” and must be shut down immediately.

Perhaps the most upsetting was the recent loss of Yani, a 34-year-old Sumatran elephant, who was visibly weeping when she died shackled on the ground. She had been sick and neglected for too long. Yani’s species is critically endangered and she was one of about 2,800 of these majestic animals left.

Tourists often report that the confined animals look emaciated and weak. The zoo is overcrowded and doesn't have a veterinarian on hand, so when animals fall ill they are left to suffer like Yani. These are not the only horrific events to have occurred within the zoo, and won’t be the last.

Join me in imploring the President of Indonesia and his Minister of Environment and Forestry to shut down this zoo and relocate these animals to a conservation or sanctuary where they can be taken care of.

Boycott all zoos and boycott Indonesia. ""We are the Spartacus for the voiceless""

We need your help. Please consider donating. Every dollar helps. thx https://www.gofundme.com/sunbearsindonesia

This petition will be delivered to:Sun Bears kept in Bandung Zoo, West Java, Indonesia are so hungry they eat their own dung. This is not the only horrific theme discovered within this zoo.

Yani an endangered Sumatran elephant was this zoo latest victim. In May of 2016, she died crying, and shackled in chains.  In 2014, a giraffe suddenly died and was found to have 40lbs of plastic trash in it's stomach.

The animals in this zoo rely heavily on food donations to survive and with no on site veterinarian. A zoo is not a charity nor is it a death pit for innocent animals.

Many of your zoos are also found to be in deplorable conditions eg Surabaya Zoo. There are numerous and various online petitions to shut down Surabaya Zoo and one of the petitions has gathered close to 1 million signatures. Why have you not taken any action? How do you sleep at night knowing that a giraffe is so hungry it had to eat trash and sun bears so hungry they eat their own dung?

It is unconscionable how you continue to do nothing whilst these innocent animals, many that are endangered species suffer and feel no moral duty to protect these animals from neglect and abuse.

We urge you President Widodo and Madam Minister, enforce your law 5/1990. These offenders must not go unpunished.

Please seek the basic humanity in your hearts and do the right thing. Shut down this zoo and work with animal activist groups to relocate these animals to conservation/sanctuary centers where they can be properly taken care off.

Medical debt is a subject near and dear to KIRO 7’s Jesse Jones – both to his heart and his wallet.

Jesse is a cancer survivor with medical debt. He’s been on payment plans, has a job and insurance.

But there are others who are not as fortunate. Thousands of families dealing with crushing medical debt every single day.

At 5 p.m. on KIRO 7, Jesse shares stories of two local people and their battle with medical debt.

He also finds a way to help over 1,000 people struggling with their medical debt by doing something that’s never been done in our area before.

‘I ain’t got nothing to say,” the cornerback said post game.”They gave up on me. F—. It is what it is.”

Though there is still no official word from the Patriots or Butler on why exactly he was benched, Joe Cartolano, writer at ProFootballFocus, tweeted out Monday morning that a source within law enforcement gave insight that Butler reportedly missed curfew at the Patriots team hotel, and did so coming back with marijuana.

A family friend who I trust, is well connected in law enforcement and was in Minny this week with local cops told me Butler missed curfew, got caught with weed when he came back late to hotel, and subsequently had a meltdown on coaches

Seconds after the Patriots quarterback’s hail mary fell past the arms of any receiver and onto the turf in U. S. Bank Stadium, Brady jogged to the locker room as Bill Belichick and Doug Pederson congratulated each other at midfield.

Many were quick to call Brady out on the apparent lack of sportsmanship, some of which noticed photos of Brady congratulating the opposing quarterback following Super Bowl wins exist, why those during losses, don’t.

Tom Brady’s worst move of the day was jogging off the field after the game was lost. Should have had the class to at least shake Nick Foles hand. #SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly

Tom Brady didn’t congratulate Nick Foles and that’s all you need to know about Tom Brady.

The last four Super Bowl losing QBs somehow managed to congratulate the winning QB after the game.

But not Tom Brady. This photo doesn’t exist for any of his 3 Super Bowl losses.

Help to stop the deportation of Syed Jamal0 have signed. Let's get to 7,500!Mr. Syed Jamal, beloved Lawrence family man, scientist and community leader, has been detained by ICE agents and is being held in jail in Morgan County, Missouri awaiting deportation.  Syed is a well-respected Molecular Biologist who has done significant research with the University of Kansas, Children’s Mercy, Rockhurst University, and other local entities.  He has lived in the United States for thirty years and has attained his undergraduate and graduate degrees here.  Syed is a devoted supporter of his children’s schools, regularly volunteering in classrooms and on site councils and recently mounting a campaign for a vacated school board seat.  Syed is viewed as a leader within his faith community at the Lawrence Islamic Center as well.

Last week, Syed was arrested in front of two of his children as he readied them for school.  His wife and three children (9th grade, 7th grade, and 1st grade) are devastated and fearful.  They are fully aware that Syed could be deported to his home country of Bangladesh, where he is a minority and in grave danger.  This family is in crisis and needs our support.  Please write a letter asking for a stay of removal to try to keep Mr. Jamal with his family.

Here is a letter that his son recently wrote in support of a stay of removal for his father:

My name is Taseen Jamal, and my father has recently been arrested, taken to the Morgan County, MO, jail, and is being considered for deportation. My little brother cries every night, my sister can't focus in school, and I cannot sleep at night. My mother is in trauma, and because she is a live organ donor, she only has one kidney, so the stress is very dangerous. She could die if he is deported. If my father is deported, my siblings and I may never get to see him again. He is an older man, and due to the conditions of his home country, he might not be able to survive.

My father called us, and he was crying like like a little child because he was thinking about what would happen to us if he got deported. If he gets sent back to Bangladesh, his home country, he will be in grave danger, and people of his kind are persecuted there. Just in 2014, nine people of his kind were burned alive. He has been in the US for 30 years, and the law has kept him from gaining citizenship. He has helped throughout our community, and has a lot breakthroughs in science, many of which are still being researched. If he is deported, that research may never be finished, making a great loss to the field is science.

We are the children of Syed Jamal, and we are requesting on behalf of our family for your kind help to get back our father. A home is not a home without a father.

This was a fall of $112.6 billion in value from a day before.

Cryptocurrencies have seen a major sell-off this week. Bitcoin fell below $9,000 on Thursday and briefly dropped below $8,000 Friday morning, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index, which tracks prices from four major cryptocurrency exchanges.

Other major coins including ethereum and ripple were down 12 percent and 13 percent, respectively, compared to a day ago as of 9:58 a.m., ET, Friday.

The cryptocurrency world has been plagued by a spate of negative news.

India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the country wants to ""eliminate"" the use of digital currencies in criminal activities, signaling tighter regulation in the country.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that an increasing number of digital currency investors are worried the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies have been inflated by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which is included in CoinDesk's price index.

Um juiz do Paraná proibiu uma mulher de curtir o verão porque ela não tem uma boia de flamingo. A notícia ganhou repercussão internacional.

O drama começou após Viviane Pereira, 27 anos, ser convidada para uma festa na piscina, casa de uma amiga. Ao chegar no local, Viviane percebeu que todos os convidados tinham bois de flamingo e só ela não. Os amigos começaram a rir de Viviane e, trinta minutos depois, expulsaram ela da festa.

Viviane tentou processar os amigos, mas sem sucesso. Foi proibida pelo juiz de curtir o carnaval. Pelo menos até comprar uma boia de flamingo.

“É preciso que ela entenda que a boia de flamingo é necessária nos dias de hoje. As modas lançadas no Instagram são fundamentais para que a sociedade funcione em harmonia e, até que ela consiga sua própria boia, não poderá entrar em piscinas, curtir praias, clubes e nem postar fotos no insta” diz a decisão do juiz.

Last week we released a state of development for Save the World sharing the features we are currently working on and when we hope to land them!

Due to our internal concerns regarding the stability of our v.2.5.0 update the Valentine’s and Spring it On events will be delayed a week. That means we won’t be landing the dates stated in our State of Development v1.

We will be extending the current storm event in the interim in our 2.4. X update next week. (Seasonal Gold Reset will happen in v.2.5.0)

We want you to be able to play the game and feel this is the best bet for getting a stable patch out to you!

Here is an updated timeline:

Patch 2.5.0 (~2/14)

771,1,,"You can help us report on what presidential elections in October mean for the future of Brazil, and the wider region.

The country’s top office is up for grabs, according to a new poll, after former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s conviction on corruption and money laundering charges was upheld – and his sentence increased – by an appeals court on January 24 (The Guardian). If Lula, as he is known, were allowed to run he would lead the presidential race with 34 percent of the vote, according to Datafolha’s survey.

The former president says he will appeal the ruling. But it seems unlikely he will be able to make the cut due to the slow pace of Brazil’s judiciary and a law prohibiting candidates convicted of crimes of running for public office.

With Lula seemingly out of play, the presidential playing field levels out. According to the Datafolha survey, controversial right-wing politician Jair Bolsonaro is polling second with 16 points, with environmentalist and two-times presidential contender Marina Silva in third place with eight percent. However, the survey shows that in Lula’s absence between 24 and 32 percent of potential voters would cast a blank ballot.

* What does this election mean for the future of Brazil? Politically, economically, socially, etc.

* How is Brazil’s prolonged political instability affecting the region?

* Will it help dispel or make worse voters’ badly damaged trust in the political system?

* What are the chances of Lula successfully appealing his conviction before the elections?

* If not Lula, who?

* If Lula does enter the presidential race and win again, what might happen?

* Who are some of the other presidential contenders?

* Will Operation Lava Jato help bring about meaningful political reform, or make it impossible for politics as we know them in Brazil to continue?

* Operation Lava Jato and its political and economic ramifications

* Historical low levels of trust in political leaders and overarching system

Para começar, respeite a identidade da pessoa e use os mesmos termos e pronomes que ela usa para descrever a si mesma. Além disso, trate qualquer indivíduo transgênero da mesma forma que trata a todos: respeite sua privacidade, não faça perguntas pessoais demais, e peça desculpas quando cometer gafes.

779,1,,"— Não preenche as características de um serviço feito por convicção pessoal, com fim social ou educativo. Os guarda-vidas têm carga horária definida, são subordinados ao comando militar com regras rígidas, têm admissão, demissão e inclusive processo seletivo. A diária também não preenche a característica do voluntariado porque, embora digam que seja para necessidades de alimentação e transporte, ela tem um caráter de salário: eles pagam a cada 30 dias e não exigem prestação de contas. Na verdade, conclui-se que o Estado de Santa Catarina utiliza essa forma de contratação por ser a mais barata — critica a advogada da Associação dos Profissionais de Salvamento Aquático de Santa Catarina (Apsasc), Luciana Theis.

O Corpo de Bombeiros afirma que irá atender a demanda na medida do possível, e que, além do aumento da diária, no primeiro momento está garantida a pausa para refeições. Porém, apesar de os voluntários também apontarem a caracterização de um possível vínculo empregatício, o que garantiria outros direitos trabalhistas, a corporação afirma que é inviável arcar com os custos de contratações efetivas. Por isso, a alternativa encontrada foi a atuação do modelo voluntário, em que pessoas da comunidade são treinadas para atuar na segurança dos balneários durante os meses de verão.

O governo do Estado, por sua vez, afirma que ""o edital que permitiu a contratação destes profissionais teve seu trâmite normal, passando pela Consultoria Jurídica da Secretaria de Segurança Pública e do CBM até chegar ao gabinete do secretário para sua aprovação"". Acrescenta, ainda, que ""qualquer alteração será bem vinda e objeto de análise para posterior encaminhamento ao Grupo Gestor do Estado"".

— Outro dia um banhista teve uma luxação no joelho. A gente precisava fazer a remoção, mas não tinha maca para transportá-lo. Também não temos equipamento pra medir a pressão, e olha que tem muita gente de idade que sofre com o calor. Não é só salvamento aquático, também lidamos com insolação, desidratação, acidentes com bolas, cacos de vidro, hipertensão. As pessoas veem a gente como autoridade, como a pessoa que vai cuidar delas em qualquer situação — relata um voluntário.

— Em muitos casos, não temos aporte financeiro e as características da cidade e do meio ambiente não permitem uma melhor estruturação dos postos. Tem lugares que não conseguimos puxar água ou energia. Sabemos da importância disso, a prioridade número um deles é a satisfação com o ambiente de trabalho, mas nem sempre é possível — afirma o coronel Nunes.

Os postos das praias de São Francisco do Sul têm banheiro e água, mas as condições de uso são ruins, de acordo com um guarda-vida que trabalha na região há seis temporadas.

Na Praia do Forte, em Florianópolis, a corporação até tentou construir um novo posto com acesso à energia elétrica e água encanada, mas a estrutura está prestes a cair. Com isso, os guarda-vidas trabalham sentados na areia, embaixo de um guarda-sol, com o material de primeiros socorros, roupas e alimentos.

Sobre este posto, o tenente coronel Helton de Souza Zeferino, comandante do 1° Batalhão de Bombeiros, que abrange as praias de Florianópolis, explica que no inverno foi desmontado e reconstruído com estacas mais profundas devido à ressaca que atingiu várias praias. Porém, com a amplitude de maré, o posto ficou com toda a base dentro da água. A estrutura está interditada e a empresa que construiu está avaliando a solução.

Vínculo empregatício: Ao serem aceitos para a função, os profissionais precisam assinar um termo de adesão que indica que a atuação é voluntária. Além da função de guarda-vidas, os voluntários são incumbidos de outras quatro atividades, como auxiliar na manutenção e limpeza de viaturas e equipamentos. Há, ainda, a indicação de que o voluntário está ciente da exposição à insalubridade, periculosidade e ao risco de morte. Também não há menção à carga horária ou à pausa para refeições. Os únicos direitos previstos no contrato, além do “ressarcimento das despesas efetuadas com alimentação e transporte”, são a cobertura de despesas em caso de acidentes e a pensão em caso de invalidez.

O que diz o Corpo de Bombeiros: Como se trata de uma atividade voluntária, não há regras trabalhistas a serem cumpridas. Toda a atuação dos guarda-vidas civis é feita mediante livre adesão. Quando aceitam cumprir a demanda das praias, estes o fazem de livre vontade, mediante assinatura de um termo de compromisso.

Escala de 12 horas sem pausa para refeições

O que diz o Corpo de Bombeiros: As escalas são optativas para algumas praias de 12 ou de seis horas. No caso de 12, foi acatado o pedido para 1h30min de almoço e 30 minutos de lanche à tarde. A atividade é amparada pela lei do voluntariado e pela lei estadual 13.880/2014 e regulamentada pelo decreto 1.333 de 2017.

Falta de água, energia, banheiro e equipamentos nos postos

O que diz o Corpo de Bombeiros: ""Tenho 34 temporadas no litoral catarinense e vi que houve muita evolução nesses anos. Estamos planejando 2019 já com medidas de reestruturação do que estamos fazendo hoje. Em Governador Celso Ramos, por exemplo, temos uma enorme base, com banheiro, cozinha, garagem para jet ski e quadriciclo. Tem postos mais deficitários, como os 38 postos que ficam entre Itapoá e a Baía da Babitonga. Em muitos casos, não temos como providenciar isso (água, energia e banheiro), porque não temos aporte financeiro e as características de algumas cidades e do meio ambiente não permitem. Não é uma coisa fácil, em muitos lugares não conseguimos puxar água. Estamos trabalhando em uma nova modalidade de posto baseado em contêiner, como em Itajaí. A falta eventual de equipamentos para alguns postos pode acontecer. São mais de 400 postos espalhados pelo estado e, em virtude do uso diário, alguns equipamentos podem ser perdidos ou ficam desgastados. Apesar de toda logística empenhada pelo CBM-SC para abastecimento dos postos, pode levar alguns dias para a reposição. Além disso, alguns materiais exigem compra. Nesse caso, a burocracia faz com que a espera possa ser ainda maior"", afirma o coronel Cesar Assumpção Nunes.

Governo federal autoriza uso de recursos dos BRT para obras da Copa

O Ministério das Cidades confirmou nesta segunda-feira que a prefeitura de Porto Alegre poderá utilizar os recursos destinados à implantação dos ônibus especiais BRT’s para terminar obras da Copa do Mundo de 2014 em Porto Alegre. Dessa forma, o Município pretende finalizar trechos de construções localizadas na Voluntários da Pátria, Plínio Brasil Milano e Ernesto Neugebauer, entre outras.

A Secretaria Nacional de Mobilidade Urbana (Semob) deu aval para a negociação após análise da documentação encaminhada pela prefeitura em agosto do ano passado. A solicitação da realocação de R$ 115 milhões previstos para a implantação dos chamados BRTs serão destinados para a construção do viaduto da Avenida Plínio Brasil Milano com Terceira Perimetral e na duplicação do segundo trecho da Rua Voluntários da Pátria. Essas obras, que fazem parte das melhorias previstas para o Mundial, não foram iniciadas.

Na proposta, também está prevista a retomada da pavimentação da avenida Ernesto Neugebauer e da rua José Pedro Boéssio, ambas no bairro Humaitá. Essas obras está parada por falta de recursos. A prefeitura ainda pretende negociar a transferência de mais R$ 134 milhões reservados pela Caixa para os corredores de ônibus. Não previsão de conclusão dessa negociação.

O nome da língua vem do gosto de seu criador pelos humoristas britânicos Monty Python. Van Rossum é o principal autor de Python, e seu papel central contínuo na decisão da direção de Python é reconhecido, referindo-se a ele como Ditador de Vida Benevolente (em inglês: Benevolent Dictator for Life, BDFL). Python é uma linguagem de programação interpretada cuja filosofia enfatiza uma sintaxe favorecendo um código mais legível, além de ser “free”.

Atualmente, é gerenciada pela Python Software Foundation. Possui uma licença de código aberto, chamada Python Software Foundation License, que é compatível com a GNU General Public License a partir da versão 2.1.1 e incompatível em certas versões anteriores. É uma linguagem de programação multi-paradigma, pois suporta orientação de objeto, programação imperativa e, em menor escala, programação funcional. É uma linguagem interpretada, têm seus códigos fontes transformados em uma linguagem intermediária (específica de cada linguagem), que será interpretada pela máquina virtual da linguagem quando o programa for executado. Usa tipagem dinâmica e forte, isso, significa que o próprio interpretador do Python infere o tipo dos dados que uma variável recebe, sem a necessidade que o usuário da linguagem diga de que tipo determinada variável é.

Hoje existem inúmeras linguagens no mercado que são fortemente tipadas, referenciando especificamente o Python para explicar a questão: Tipagem forte significa que o interpretador do Python avalia as expressões (evaluate) e não faz coerções automáticas entre tipos não compatíveis (conversões de valores), ou seja: Quando recebemos uma exception chamada TypeError ou seja, ao fazer operações com tipos incompatíveis, o Python não converte automaticamente esses tipos pra você, ele vai dar erro! Isso é bom, pois assim você terá a certeza que o seu resultado é mais consistente. E é multiplataforma, funcionando igualmente bem em plataformas Windows, GNULinux, UNIX e Mac/Apple, assim como outras, indo desde supercomputadores até telefones celulares. Pode ser usado para desenvolver pequenas aplicações e protótipos rápidos, mas escala bem para permitir o desenvolvimento de programas robustos. Vem com um conjunto de ferramentas para Interface Gráfica do Usuário (GUI) poderoso e fácil de usar, bibliotecas para programação web, e muito mais.

E, o melhor de tudo é grátis. Python foi feita tendo com base na linguagem ABC, parte da sintaxe derivada do C, compreensão de listas, funções anônimas e função map derivadas do Linguagem Haskell. Os iteradores são baseados na Icon, tratamentos de exceção e módulos da Modula-3, expressões regulares de Perl. Em 1991, Guido publicou o código (nomeado versão 0.9.0) no grupo de discussão alt.sources(newsgroup). Nessa versão, adicionadas classes com herança, tratamento de exceções, funções e os tipos de dados nativos: list, dict, str, e assim por diante. Como também um sistema de módulos emprestado do Modula-3. O modelo de exceções também lembrava muito o do Modula-3, com a adição da opção else. Em 1994, é formado o principal grupo de discussão do Python, comp.lang.python.

A versão 1.0 foi lançada em janeiro de 1994. Novas funcionalidades foram incluidas para programação funcional como lambda, map, filter e reduce. A última versão enquanto Guido estava na CWI foi o Python 1.2. Em 1995, trabalhando no CNRI em Reston, Estados Unidos, de onde lançou diversas atualizações. Na versão 1.4 a linguagem adicionou parâmetros nomeados e suporte nativo a números complexos, assim como uma forma de encapsulamento. Lançou a iniciativa Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E; literalmente, “Programação de Computadores para Todos”), que visava tornar a programação mais acessível, um projeto financiado pela DARPA. Atualmente o CP4E encontra-se inativo. Em 2000, o time de desenvolvimento da linguagem se mudou para a BeOpen a fim de formar o time PythonLabs. A CNRI pediu que a versão 1.6 fosse lançada, para marcar o fim de desenvolvimento da linguagem naquele local. O único lançamento na BeOpen foi o Python 2.0, e após o lançamento o grupo de desenvolvedores da PythonLabs agrupou-se na Digital Creations, implementou list comprehension, uma relevante funcionalidade de linguagens funcionais como SETL e Haskell. A sintaxe da linguagem para essa construção é bastante similar a de Haskell, exceto pela preferência do Haskell por caracteres de pontuação e da preferência do python por palavras reservadas alfabéticas. Também introduziu um sistema coletor de lixo(Garbage Coletor) capaz de identificar e tratar ciclos de referências. Python 2.1 era parecido com as versões 1.6.1 e 2.0.

Sua licença foi renomeada para Python Software Foundation License. Todo código, documentação e especificação desde o lançamento da versão alfa da 2.1 é propriedade da Python Software Foundation (PSF), uma organização sem fins lucrativos fundada em 2001, um modelo tal qual da Apache Software Foundation. No lançamento incluiu a mudança na especificação para suportar escopo aninhado, assim como outras linguagens com escopo estático. Atualmente funcionalidade estava desativada por padrão, e somente foi requerida na versão 2.2. Uma grande inovação da versão 2.2 foi a unificação dos tipos Python (escritos em C) e classes (escritas em Python) em somente uma hierarquia. Isto tornou o modelo de objetos do Python consistentemente orientado a objeto. Em 01/10/2008 foi lançada a versão 2.6, já visando a transição para a versão 3.0 da linguagem. Entre outras modificações, foram incluídas bibliotecas para multiprocessamento, JSON e E/S, além de uma nova forma de formatação de cadeias de caracteres.

O Python 3.0 ou Python 3000 foi lançado em dezembro de 2008, também chamada Python3. Houve quebra de compatibilidade com a família 2.x para corrigir falhas que foram descobertas neste padrão, e para limpar os excessos das versões anteriores. A primeira versão alfa foi lançada em 31/08/2007, a segunda em 07/12/2007. Várias mudanças foram feitas, inclindo a alteração da palavra reservada print, que passa a ser uma função, tornando mais fácil a utilização de uma versão alternativa da rotina. Python influenciou várias linguagens, algumas delas foram Boo e Cobra, que usa a indentação como definição de bloco e Go, que se baseia nos princípios de desenvolvimento rápido de Python. Em 2012, foi criado o Raspberry Pi tendo em mente a linguagem Python.

Atualmente, Python é um dos componentes padrão de vários sistemas operacionais, entre eles estão a maioria das distribuições do Linux, AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD e OS X. A linguagem se tornou a padrão no curso de ciências da computação do MIT em 2009. Além disso, muitas empresas de grande sucesso utilizam Python em seus projetos. Alguns exemplos que usam MUITO Python: Google, Youtube, Nasa, Disney, e no Brasil: Magazine Luiza, Locaweb, globo.com.

No lançamento incluiu a mudança na especificação para suportar escopo aninhado, assim como outras linguagens com escopo estático. Atualmente funcionalidade estava desativada por padrão, e somente foi requerida na versão 2.2. Uma grande inovação da versão 2.2 foi a unificação dos tipos Python (escritos em C) e classes (escritas em Python) em somente uma hierarquia. Isto tornou o modelo de objetos do Python consistentemente orientado a objeto. Em 01/10/2008 foi lançada a versão 2.6, já visando a transição para a versão 3.0 da linguagem. Entre outras modificações, foram incluídas bibliotecas para multiprocessamento, JSON e E/S, além de uma nova forma de formatação de cadeias de caracteres.

O Python 3.0 ou Python 3000 foi lançado em dezembro de 2008, também chamada Python3. Houve quebra de compatibilidade com a família 2.x para corrigir falhas que foram descobertas neste padrão, e para limpar os excessos das versões anteriores. A primeira versão alfa foi lançada em 31/08/2007, a segunda em 07/12/2007. Várias mudanças foram feitas, inclindo a alteração da palavra reservada print, que passa a ser uma função, tornando mais fácil a utilização de uma versão alternativa da rotina. Python influenciou várias linguagens, algumas delas foram Boo e Cobra, que usa a indentação como definição de bloco e Go, que se baseia nos princípios de desenvolvimento rápido de Python. Em 2012, foi criado o Raspberry Pi tendo em mente a linguagem Python.

Atualmente, Python é um dos componentes padrão de vários sistemas operacionais, entre eles estão a maioria das distribuições do Linux, AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD e OS X. A linguagem se tornou a padrão no curso de ciências da computação do MIT em 2009. Além disso, muitas empresas de grande sucesso utilizam Python em seus projetos. Alguns exemplos que usam MUITO Python: Google, Youtube, Nasa, Disney, e no Brasil: Magazine Luiza, Locaweb, globo.com.

California teacher slams military members as 'lowest of our low' in classroom rant caught on video

A video in which a Southern California high school teacher is heard slamming members of the military as “the frickin’ lowest of our low” in a classroom rant to students has gone viral.

El Rancho High history teacher Gregory Salcido -- who also serves as an elected Pico Rivera city councilman and was once mayor -- even goes so far as to refer to those who are in the military overseas as failed students who had no choice but to serve, ""Fox & Friends"" reported Sunday.

“Think about the people you know who are over there,” Salcido is heard saying. “Your freakin' stupid Uncle Louie or whatever. They're dumb s - - - s. They're not high-level bankers. They're not academic people. They're not intellectual people.""

“They’re the freakin’ lowest of our low.”

He is also heard questioning why military recruiters were allowed to visit the school.

“We don’t allow pimps to come into the school,” he says.

A post on Facebook with videos of the rants had nearly 1.5 million views as of Saturday, the Orange County Register reported.

District Superintendent Karling Aguilera-Fort told the paper that he had not spoken to Salcido because the teacher was out of town. He said Salcido would be disciplined.

Salcido posted a statement on his personal Facebook page Friday from New York.

“The Salcido 3 just got out of an excellent musical, “The Band’s Arrival,” he said. “I turned my phone back on to unexpectedly see a storm. I don’t think it’s wise for me to make any specific comments, but I want my friends, family, and students to know we are fine and we respect the rights of free expression for all individuals.”

Pico Rivera Mayor Gustavo Camacho issued a statement that did not address Salcido’s remarks, but said that the city was founded upon the “principles, values and sacrifices” of our many veterans who when called upon served with great pride and honor.”

The student who shot the video told local news outlets that he shot the video Jan. 19 during a government class at the Pico Rivera school.

He told CBS2 Los Angeles that he took out his cellphone when Salcido started lecturing another student who was wearing a Marines sweatshirt.

""I was very angry,"" the student said.

He appears to have shot the video from underneath a desk. Salcido is heard on the video but not seen.

The student told the Register that Salcido went too far when he said those in the military were stupid and only joined as a last resort.

“It was so disrespectful to my dad and my uncles and all veterans and those still in the military,” he said.

He said his father was a Marine vet as were two uncles. He said they fought in Afghanistan, Desert Storm and Vietnam.

He said the video wasn't meant for anyone else, but his mother shared it with a few friends ""and now it's this.""

In 2010 Salcido was accused by a parent of making inappropriate comments about race to his summer school class, the Register reported.

He denied making the comments and was suspended for the rest of the summer session.

797,1,,"Outra vez eu me sirvo deste menino que faz o tal Tijolaço para ser meu cambono. Medíocre, é verdade, mas é quem está à mão, fazer o quê?

Para ver se revolvia a sua terra pouco fértil, mandei-lhe uma emanação, aqui do éter, para que ouvisse o que falei no enterro do Gláuber Rocha. Claro que não porque você esteja morto, como eu e ele, mas porque te quero sugerir que, como ele, esta noite, chore.

Eu disse lá: “O Gláuber chorava, chorava convulsivamente. O Gláuber chorava a dor que todos devíamos chorar,  a dor de todos os brasileiros. O Gláuber chorava as crianças com fome, O Gláuber chorava um país que não deu certo, o Gláuber chorava a brutalidade, a mediocridade, a estupidez”…

Pois então, meu caro Lula, sinta-se livre hoje para chorar. Não por você, que sei, por já ter tido a sua idade e um câncer como você, sei que não liga mais para si mesmo. Nem eu, que me amava tanto e tão profundamente, dava muita importância a mim, a não ser pelo que podia fazer, dizer e escrever. E nesta ordem.

Chore, Lula, chore. Mas chore só hoje.

Que amanhã, como você se acostumou, é dia de ir cedo para a fábrica. Porque é muito parecido, não é? Moldar ideias é como moldar metais: é duro, cheio de asperezas e sujeito a acidentes que nos machucam. E é pior, até, porque não tem descanso, nem fim de semana, e a falta de uma rede nos faz doer as costas de macunaímas.

Lula, os estatutos desta gafieira onde me encontro – não sei se é celeste ou infernal, porque não entendo um céu sem pecados e nem um inferno sem virtudes – impedem-me de te revelar o futuro.  Posso apenas te dizer que não é fácil como o de quem morre e vira santo, porque depois que a gente desencarna, até os cínicos nos aplaudem.

Quando a gente está vivo, nos acusam de tudo. A mim, usaram uma foto para dizer que eu me aliava a banqueiros do jogo do bicho. Como é que eu ia ser Secretário de Cultura do Rio de Janeiro, fazer o Sambódromo e cuidar do Carnaval sem encontrar os bicheiros das Escolas de Samba?

Nos limites em que Deus controla minha língua – sou justo, não me reprime nos diálogos que travamos, porque Deus é onisciente mas aceita a dúvida, ao contrário dos bobalhões togados que te condenaram hoje, posso te contar só um pouquinho.

Posso contar, apenas, o que já escrevi, e mando este menino que cavalgo mentalmente agora, vá buscar no meu “O Povo Brasileiro”:

Cada vez que um político nacionalista ou populista se encaminha para a revisão da institucionalidade, as classes dominantes apelam para a repressão e a força.

Eu mesmo sofri isso, como auxiliar de Jango. Só me deixaram voltar aos Brasil quando acharam – como vão achar você – prestes a morrer de um câncer que me levou um pulmão. Por isso, te digo, o que é ser preso perto de estar na iminência da morte?

Não é a primeira vez que escrevo sobre você. A primeira foi quando ainda estava por aí, em 1989, e desabafei:

Estou me cansando de ouvir falar de Lula com descaso. Qualquer advogadinho idiota, porque formado, se acha melhor que ele, mais preparado para governar. Um intelectual desses que leu meia dúzia de livros ou escreveu qualquer bobagem, um tecnocrata que desempenhou bem ou mal algum cargo, todos se acham melhores que Lula e falam dele sem sombra de respeito. Por que? Essa gente pensa que o exercício do poder, em postos de alta responsabilidade, cabe a uma categoria particularíssima de pessoas, na qual não incluiriam jamais um ex-operário ou um líder sindical, ainda que muito bem-sucedido.

Não errei, não é?

Nem eu nem você quisemos ser mártires – e eles, os grandões, também não querem, porque não há mídia que seja capaz de vencer mártires.

Mas estes caras são tão imbecis, tão idiotas, que nos fazem isso. Como eles são filhos e netos de senhores de escravos, acham que nos atar ao tronco e vergastar, vai encher de medo a senzala.

Na hora, sim, que ninguém é bobo de querer o chicote no lombo, mas lhes vai endurecendo o couro das mentes e  deixando que elas não aceitem mais a servidão.

Então, Lula, chore esta noite e acorde amanhã livre de rancores. Como um negro fugido, que os capitães de mato querem enjaular, seja sabido.

Eles verão um nordestino, que mal escapou de ser gabiru, virar ainda mais gigante.

Agora, por favor, não me obrigue mais a estas comunicações psicográficas e deixe que eu as reserve para a Dona Diva, aquela negra linda da Feira Literária de Parati, que é linda e 20 e tantos anos mais nova que eu -que a Catherine Deneuve nos abençoe.

Quando eu mandar, daqui, uma edição revisada de O Povo Brasileiro, prometo, cuido do que você é, a metamorfose ambulante com que se define.

Mas, antes, estou observando a borboleta voar.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, a week after it claimed an attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul in which more than 20 people were killed.

""It is a massacre,"" said Dejan Panic coordinator in Afghanistan for the Italian aid group Emergency, which runs a nearby trauma hospital. In a message on Twitter, the group said more than 50 wounded had been brought in to that hospital alone.

A spokesman from the interior ministry confirmed 103 dead and 191 wounded had been brought to city hospitals, according to Al Jazeera.

Mirwais Yasini, a member of parliament who was nearby when the explosion occurred, said the ambulance approached the checkpoint, close to an office of the High Peace Council and several foreign embassies, and blew up.

He said a number of people were lying on the ground. People helped walking wounded away as ambulances with sirens wailing inched their way through the traffic-clogged streets of the city center.

A plume of gray smoke rose from the blast area in the city center and buildings hundreds of meters away were shaken by the force of the explosion.

Lê a mensagem até ao fim; e depois, manda para os outros na tua lista de amigos como eu fiz contigo!  Dr. Stephen Mak trata de doentes com cancro terminal de uma forma “não ortodoxa/menos comum” e muitos paciêntes recuperam. Antes, ele usava energia Solar para eliminar a doença dos seus pacientes. Ele acredita no tratamento natural contra doenças no corpo. Vê o seu artigo abaixo. “É uma das estratégias para curar o cancro. Ultimamente, a minha taxa de sucesso é de 80 %. Pacientes com cancro não devem morrer. A cura para o cancro já foi encontrada – está na forma como comemos fruta. Isso é, quer acredites ou não.

Não é assim tão facil como pensamos. É importante saber como e quando comer as frutas. Qual é a forma correta de comer fruta? Significa não comer as frutas depois das refeições!  Frutas devem ser comidas de Estômago vazio. Se comeres fruta de estômago vazio, elas terão um papel maior na desintoxicação do teu sistema, fornecendo-te com muita energia para perderes o peso e outros bens de saúde. As frutas são os alimentos mais importantes.  Digamos que tu comes duas fatias de pão e depois uma fatia de fruta. A fatia de fruta está pronta a ir directo aos intestinos através do estômago, mas é impedida de ir devido ao pão que comeste antes da fruta. Enquanto isso, a comida toda de pão e fruta apodrece e fermenta, tornando-se em ácido. No minuto que a fruta entra em contacto com a comida no estômago e sucos digestivos, a massa inteira de comida começa a estragar o seu efeito.  Portanto, por favor, come a tua fruta de estômago vazio ou antes das refeições!

Para quem viaja e está hospedando em hotéis com novo tipo de chave, e mesmo porque logo a maioria estará com este tipo de chave = cartão magnético para abrir as portas, quase igual ao cartão de crédito. CHAVES MAGNÉTICAS DE HOTÉIS.  Alguma vez você já se perguntou o que está armazenado nas chaves magnéticas (que se assemelham aos cartões de crédito) dos hotéis? Veja as informações e mude seus hábitos:  Nome do hóspede,  RG, CPF,  Endereço do hóspede,  Número do apartamento do hotel,  Datas do check-in e ckeck-out,  Número do cartão de crédito, e sua data de validade! Quando você as devolve na recepção, suas informações ficam lá disponíveis para qualquer funcionário com acesso ao ‘scanner’ do hotel. Ou ainda, um funcionário pode levar um monte delas para casa e, utilizando um aparelho de ‘scanner’ magnético, ter acesso às suas informações e sair gastando pela internet. Simplificando, os hotéis não apagam as informações das chaves magnéticas até que um novo hóspede faça uso delas, quando suas informações sobrescreverá as do antigo hóspede. Mas até que a chave seja re-utilizada, ela fica, geralmente, na gaveta da recepção com as suas informações que nela foram “armazenadas”. Resumindo:  Guarde com você suas chaves magnéticas, leve-as para casa ou as destrua. Nunca as deixe no quarto, no lixo do banheiro e JAMAIS as devolva para a recepção quando estiver fazendo o check-out. Os hotéis não podem cobrar pelas chaves (é ilegal) e você terá certeza de que não estará deixando um monte de informações pessoais valiosas que podem ser facilmente acessadas, e utilizadas, com um ‘scanner’ magnético. Pela mesma razão, se você chegar ao aeroporto e descobrir que ainda está carregando a chave com você, não a jogue nas cestas de lixo.

Hoje o mesmo Esquerda Valente insistiu e soltou outra matéria relacionada que levou a AEPPSP a solicitar que a menção à associação fosse retirada da matéria com a seguinte explicação: “Retiramos a publicação do ar depois da transformação de um post que realizamos em uma notícia falsa. A disseminação dessas informações nos traz muitos inconvenientes.” Mesmo com todo esforço em desmentir o caso, a matéria da Esquerda Valente sobre o suposto estudo chegou a mais de 45 mil compartilhamentos e requentou a matéria de janeiro da IssoÉNotícia que chegou a 101 mil compartilhamentos.

Já tínhamos o presidente e alguns militares fieis a mãe soviética. Os camaradas brasileiros como eram? O primeiro grupo que treinamos eram todos do Brasil. Indisciplinados e usavam muitas drogas e gastavam muito sem retorno. Foi quando enviamos o segundo grupo armado para infiltrarem no centro do país; região do Cambiocá, creio que era este nome. Tínhamos agentes comunistas infiltrados em todos lugares: bispos, padres, cantores, médicos, militares, professores e políticos eram monitorados pelo camarada comunista Lamarca. As ordens do Kremlim de Moscovo eram para criarmos uma base de sustenção armada caso ouve-se resistência.

939,2,,"Texto: Traficante de drogas é absolvido por portar arma para se defender dos concorrentes. Esse fato ocorreu em julho de 2015, mas traduz exatamente a realidade que acontece hoje onde os valores estão sendo trocados e o marginal está com muito mais direitos do que o cidadão comum. Se um advogado, ou qualquer outra pessoa, portar uma arma para sua defesa pessoal responderá por porte ilegal de arma, no entanto, a 3a Câmara Criminal do Tribunal de Justiça do Rio Grande do Sul, em julgamento da Apelação Criminal o traficante de drogas ilícitas foi absolvido em sua apelação, sob a tese de que a arma era utilizada para proteção pessoal em razão do comércio de entorpecentes praticado e ao guarnecimento da atividade ilícita. Em outras palavras pode se dizer que o bandido tem direito a portar uma arma para a sua defesa contra os outros bandidos de outras facções, pois necessita pela atividade de risco que pratica. É no mínimo inusitado, para não dizer estranho que o Poder Judiciário considere lógica a absolvição por atipicidade o crime de porte ilegal de arma, quando for cometido em defesa do criminoso para se defender dos demais criminosos. ... Áudio: Oi Andréa, tudo bom? Em primeiro lugar, um abração para ti. Uma Feliz Páscoa. Estamos com saudade dos nossos amigos mineiros no Rio Grande do Sul. Bom, em segundo lugar, sobre essa jurisprudência, absurda, estapafúrdia, escatológica do Tribunal de Justiça do Rio Grande do Sul, é verdade sim. Tanto que o promotor de Justiça, o Amorim, já tinha ido para a imprensa e criticado horrores essa decisão. Porque a questão é a seguinte: se tu ou eu, um advogado. A gente pode ter porte de armas, mas alguém que não tenha, uma pessoa comum, honesto, trabalhador que não tenha porte de armas, se ele andar com uma arma, ele responde por porte ilegal de armas. Mas a nossa 3a Câmara criminal do Tribunal de Justiça, maravilhosa, conhecidíssima, principalmente pelos promotores de Justiça, que vivem recorrendo das decisões daquela Câmara. É verdade sim, o traficante de drogas, aconteceu sim, ele foi absolvido na acusação do crime de porte ilegal de armas porque foi considerado que a arma era instrumento para defesa pessoal em virtude do comercio de drogas que ele realizava, e para ele se proteger na atividade ilícita. Agora tu vê o absurdo: o cara é um criminoso, o tráfico de drogas, até onde sei, é um crime, mas daqui a pouco pode acabar não sendo do jeito que as coisas vão, e ele para se proteger e se manter na atividade ilegal pode portar uma arma. Só que o que esses desembargadores não consideram é que ele pode usar essa mesma arma, que absurdamente acham que é legítimo o porte para se proteger e para manter essa atividade ilegal dele. Só que eles não levam em conta outra coisa: é que essa arma pode acabar por matar o policial que vai prendê-lo. Que vai matar o cidadão que estiver devendo dinheiro para ele. Isso eles não pensaram, isso eles não viram. Isso coisa de pessoa alienada que fica tomando decisões dentro de gabinete. Não sai para rua, não pega ônibus, não pega trânsito, não sabe o que está acontecendo na rua, anda com segurança, mora em condomínio fechado.

A partir de Julho começam a chegar no Brasil os navios que trarão cerca de 1 milhão 800 mil refugiados vindos da Europa. O alto comissário da ONU para Direitos Humanos, Zeid Raad al-Hussein diz que o Brasil é exemplo ao mundo quanto a receber os muçulmanos que ninguém quer, e estão exportando da Europa. OBS: Vejam o nome da criatura da ONU !! Então, o recado é esse para você: nós sabemos que o Brasil vai virar uma baderna, muito mais do que já é. Se nós não temos trabalho, emprego, remédios, hospitais, nada. Se nós não temos nada para nós, imagina para mais 2 milhões, milhões, dos quais uma “cacetada” de terroristas, assassinos, vindo no meio disso.  A gente precisa pensar em alguma coisa e urgente.

Sem imaginar os problemas que esta aventura sexual poderia proporcionar, e focada em conseguir no animal a sensação de prazer na qual ela não conseguiu com nenhum outro parceiro, a jovem introduziu a cobra em seu corpo. A jiboia, que era muito grande, acabou presa em seu órgão sexual. Desesperada, ela recorreu a um hospital para socorrê-la. A maranhense precisou ser operada para a retirada da serpente e um vídeo, que circula na web, mostra o pós-operatório, na qual a cobra aparece suja de sangue ao lado da jovem. De acordo com a imprensa internacional, ele teria sido gravado por profissionais do hospital onde a mulher foi atendida. Ela continua internada, recebendo acompanhamento médico. Ainda não há previsão de alta e o hospital disse que ela não corre risco de morte.",1,819,,b58be9f667654b20091b67d2713bedd5,,

Os islâmicos nos massacram, e vocês bombardeiam os islâmicos...e a sociedade não se reproduz. O resultado é que vocês governantes do mundo, esperam uma eficaz redução populacional. Mas isto não termina aqui. Também impulsionam ao ódio entre homens e mulheres. Destruíram o movimento feminista para o transformar em uma guerra entre seres biologicamente aptos. Homens e mulheres.  Se homens e mulheres se aborrecem entre eles, as chances de que se reproduzam se esfumam por completo. Este plano monstruoso está acompanhado de uma filosofia neomarxista e da mente débil dos jovens. Jovens que compraram discursos predigeridos. Meninos e meninas que se negam a pensar por si mesmos.  Fizeram-lhes lavagem cerebral, e alienaram as suas mentes com idéias absurdas. Os odiotizaram por completo! Fazem-nos defender leis jihadistas.

Forty-two of the richest people in the world now hold as much wealth as 3.7 billion of the poorest people in the world, according to the report, released Monday by the international charitable organization.

The report showed that about 82 percent of wealth created across the globe went to the top 1 percent. “Our broken economies reward wealth not hard work,” Oxfam International Executive Director Winnie Byanyima tweeted Monday. “Rich get richer, millions trapped in poverty wages or joblessness. Leaders must reverse this.”

The report was released just days before this year’s World Economic Forum, from January 23 to 26. World leaders of politics and business, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, U. K. Prime Minister Theresa May and American President Donald Trump, are attending. Oxfam released similarly shocking statistics in 2017 ahead of the Davos, Switzerland, gathering.

Trump is scheduled to give a “special” closing address at the forum on Friday, and is expected to promote his “America First” agenda.

He made it a central goal of his 2016 presidential campaign—and most recently with the passage of GOP tax reform—to bring back American jobs and wealth from overseas.

When asked about Trump’s “America First” agenda, World Economic Forum President Borge Brende said, “You only succeed if others do well too.”

Last year, U. S. Census Bureau data showed that many Americans were emerging from poverty and that median household income was up by 3.2 percent between 2015 and 2016.

According to the Oxfam report, the three wealthiest Americans claim as much wealth as the 160 million poorest people living in the United States. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos made over $35 billion and usurped Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in 2017 to become the richest man in the world. The president’s Cabinet is also the wealthiest in American history, and many of those who head U. S. federal agencies are millionaires or billionaires.

“And I love all people—rich or poor—but in those particular positions, I just don’t want a poor person,” Trump said in defense of his Cabinet picks in June 2017.

1381,2,,"Glen Oliver é um cara que só quer tornar o dia das pessoas mais leve e feliz. E, por isso, o canadense decidiu há bastante tempo que toda vez que comprasse o seu café em um drive-thru local, ele pagaria um café e um bolinho para a pessoa atrás dele na fila. Ele faz isso cerca de duas vezes por semana e só pede que o caixa diga à pessoa “premiada” que ela tenha um bom dia. O que Oliver não sabia é que um pequeno propósito como esse seria capaz de salvar uma vida.

Uma pessoa enviou uma carta anônima a um jornal local de Durham, Ontário, o Durham Region, contando que alguém havia pago seu café e lhe desejado um bom dia através do caixa. Mas não era só isso: o autor da carta explicou que, naquele momento, sua vida estava tão ruim que ele não queria mais viver. Naquele 18 de julho em que o gesto de Oliver o alcançou, a pessoa estava decidida que aquele seria o seu último mês de vida.

Tudo mudou com a boa ação de Oliver. “Eu me perguntei por que alguém compraria café para um estranho sem motivo algum. Por que eu? Por que hoje? Se eu fosse religioso, tomaria isso como um sinal. Esse ato aleatório de bondade foi dirigido a mim naquele dia com um propósito”, escreveu o destinatário da boa ação.

Surpreso com o gesto, o autor da carta tomou inspiração e decidiu ajudar um estranho também. Naquele dia, ele ajudou sua vizinha descarregando as compras do carro e levando-as de forma segura para dentro da casa dela.

A carta se encerrava com um agradecimento pelo que Oliver tinha feito: “Cara gentil da caminhonete: obrigado do fundo do meu coração. Saiba que o seu gesto de bondade salvou uma vida”. O autor da carta disse que aquele dia foi um dos melhores de sua vida.

Uma vez publicada a carta, o jornal chegou até a casa de Oliver em um dia de novembro. “Eu estava sentado no sofá ao lado da minha esposa e ouvi que ela choramingava ao ler alguma coisa”, contou Oliver ao BuzzFeed Canada. “Ela se aproximou de mim e disse: ‘Leia isso’. No fim, eu estava chorando também”.

“Eu casei com o amor da minha vida e tenho quatro filhos maravilhosos, então qualquer coisa que se possa fazer para tornar a vida dos outros um pouco melhor deve ser feita”, afirmou o benfeitor. “Não somos ricos, mas temos tudo”.

1382,1,,"Uma das maiores bolsas de criptomoedas do Japão afirmou que cerca de US$ 400 milhões em tokens NEM se perderam depois que as moedas foram retiradas “ilicitamente” das instalações, assustando os investidores de um país ainda cauteloso em relação às bolsas de tokens digitais quatro anos após o colapso da Mt. Gox.

Após horas de especulações, Yusuke Otsuka, cofundador da Coincheck, informou em uma entrevista coletiva à noite na Bolsa de Valores de Tóquio que a companhia não sabia que os 500 milhões de tokens haviam desaparecido, mas a firma está empenhada em garantir a segurança de todos os ativos dos clientes. A Coincheck havia anunciado anteriormente a suspensão de todos os saques, a paralisação das negociações de todos os tokens, com exceção do bitcoin, e a interrupção dos depósitos em moedas NEM.

“Estamos analisando os fatos em torno da Coincheck”, afirmou a Agência de Serviços Financeiros do Japão em comunicado. Este desaparecimento provavelmente é uma das maiores perdas ou roubos de ativos de investidores desde o advento das moedas digitais, com o lançamento do bitcoin em 2009.

A NEM, 10ª maior criptomoeda em valor de mercado, caía 7,5 por cento no período às 11h28 em Nova York, para US$ 0,86, segundo o Coinmarketcap.com. O bitcoin registrava uma queda de menos de 1 por cento, e o ripple recuava 5 por cento, de acordo com os preços disponíveis na Bloomberg.

No Japão, um dos maiores mercados de criptomoedas do mundo, as autoridades lançaram um sistema de licenciamento para ampliar a supervisão dos negócios locais a fim de evitar a repetição do colapso da bolsa Mt. Gox, que sacudiu os mercados de criptomoedas em todo o mundo em 2014. Naquele momento, o roubo de bitcoin foi estimado em cerca de US$ 450 milhões, embora esse número tenha sido modificado posteriormente.

As bolsas de criptomoedas, das quais muitas operam com pouca ou nenhuma regulação, sofreram uma série de interrupções e cortes em meio à explosão do trading que empurrou o bitcoin e seus pares a altas recorde no ano passado.

Assim como o bitcoin, a NEM é uma criptomoeda construída com base no blockchain, mas que usa um método mais ecológico para confirmar as transações, segundo seu website. A mineração de bitcoin exige um poder de computação significativo, diferentemente da NEM, segundo a própria.

Fundada em 2012, a Coincheck contava com 71 funcionários em julho e tem sede no distrito de Shibuya, uma área popular de Tóquio entre as startups, inclusive da Mt. Gox, segundo o website da Coincheck. No ano passado, começou a exibir comerciais nas emissoras de televisão do país apresentados pelo popular comediante local Tetsuro Degawa.

1385,2,,"A Polícia Federal deflagrou nesta manhã de domingo mais uma fase da Operação Zelotes, que investiga um esquema de pagamento de propina a integrantes do Carf

(Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais), vinculado ao Ministério da Fazenda.

A PF cumpriu mandado de busca e apreensão na empresa LFT Marketing Esportivo, que pertence a Luis Cláudio Lula da Silva, filho do ex-presidente Lula, na rua Padre João Manuel, nos Jardins, bairro nobre de São Paulo.

Segundo funcionários do prédio, a operação aconteceu por volta das 6h.

Agentes, que chegaram em um carro da Receita Federal e em outros dois da PF, foram até o quinto andar do edifício, onde fica a empresa. Vizinhos e funcionários do prédio relataram que os policiais permaneceram no local por cerca de duas horas e saíram com várias pastas carregadas de documentos.

O irmão mais velho de Luis Cláudio, Fábio Luis Lula da Silva –o Lulinha–, chegou a ter um escritório no mesmo prédio, mas se mudou no ano passado.

Além da LFT, Luis Cláudio é proprietário da Touchdown Promoções e Eventos Esportivos, que administra a liga de futebol americano Torneio Touchdown, que conta com 16 equipes. Essa empresa, que funciona no mesmo endereço da LFT, também foi alvo da operação.

Documentos que integram a operação apontam que a LFT Marketing Esportivo recebeu R$ 1,5 milhão da Marcondes e Mautoni na mesma época em que os lobistas foram remunerados por empresas interessadas na renovação dos efeitos de uma medida provisória pelo governo federal.

Para a Procuradoria da República no DF, “é muito suspeito que uma empresa de marketing esportivo receba valor tão expressivo de uma empresa especializada em manter contatos com a administração pública (Marcondes e Mautoni)”.

Entre 2013 e 2014, segundo a investigação, o grupo de lobistas atuou para renovar uma medida provisória de 2009, com prazo de validade de cinco anos, que, na época, havia gerado o pagamento de “comissões”. A empreitada, de acordo com a Zelotes, resultou na edição da medida provisória n° 627, de 2013, que foi convertida em lei no ano seguinte.

A investigação não aponta de que forma Luis Cláudio supostamente teria agido para a renovação da medida provisória.

De acordo com o jornal “O Estado de S. Paulo”, o Marcondes e Mautoni foi contratado pela Caoa Hyundai para obter a extensão da desoneração fiscal por meio da medida provisória, que teria sido comprada por lobistas durante o governo Lula.

A Caoa Hyundai também teve relações com o filho de Lula. Nos anos de 2012 e 2013, a empresa foi patrocinadora do Touchdown, o torneio de futebol americano que Luis Cláudio é dono. Tanto o empresário quanto a Caoa se recusaram a abrir valores e informações sobre o contrato de patrocínio.

Marcondes conheceu Lula há mais de 30 anos, quando era funcionário do departamento de Recursos Humanos da Volkswagen e negociava com o ex-presidente, na época um dos líderes sindicais de maior expressão do país. ÀFolha, ele disse que só conheceu Luis Cláudio em 2014, apresentado por um jornalista.

Escritórios de advocacia de São Paulo entraram em alerta máximo na manhã desta segunda ao receberem a informação sobre a operação de busca e apreensão da PF que tem o filho do ex-presidente como um dos alvos.

O advogado Cristiano Zanin Martins, que defende Luis Cláudio, criticou a operação de busca da Polícia Federal nos escritórios da firma do filho de ex-presidente.

Martins pediu à Justiça e à Polícia Federal acesso a todo o material usado para justificar a medida. Ele disse que a falta de acesso aos autos “impede que a defesa possa exercer o contraditório e tomar outras medidas cabíveis”.

A PF também faz buscas em endereços ligados a Lytha Spindola, que foi secretária-executiva da Câmara de Comércio Exterior, auditora da Receita Federal e secretária de Comércio Exterior do Ministério de Desenvolvimento.

Ao todo, estão sendo cumpridos 33 mandados judiciais –seis de prisão preventiva, 18 de busca e apreensão e nove de condução coercitiva em Brasília, São Paulo, no Piauí e no Maranhão.

Entre os alvos de condução coercitiva estão os sócio-fundador da Mitsubishi do Brasil, Eduardo Souza Ramos, e o dono da Caoa, Carlos Alberto de Oliveira Andrade.

Os policiais estiveram no escritório da MMC Automotores, responsável pela Mitsubishi no Brasil.

A Folha apurou que entre os presos está Alexandre Paes dos Santos, apontado como lobista que intermediava contatos entre empresas e conselheiros do Carf, e José Ricardo da Silva, sócio da empresa SGR, também suspeito de ser um dos atravessadores do esquema.

Os policiais fizeram busca e apreensão também na casa de Fernando Cesar Mesquita, ex-chefe de Comunicação Social do Senado.

A etapa desta segunda mira um grupo de empresas que, além de tentarem interferir nos julgamentos do Carf, atuavam negociando incentivos fiscais para o setor automotivo.

A investigação indica suspeitas de tráfico de influência, extorsão, e corrupção de agentes públicos, com o objetivo de aprovar alterações na legislação benéficas a essas empresas.

A primeira etapa da operação foi deflagrada em março e desarticulou um esquema de pagamento de propina a integrantes do Carf, órgão vinculado ao Ministério da Fazenda e responsável por julgar recursos de multas aplicadas pela Receita Federal.

Em troca de suborno, conselheiros votavam em favor da redução e, em alguns casos, do perdão das multas das empresas que os corrompiam.

A operação investiga processos que somam R$ 19 bilhões. Segundo a Polícia Federal, esse é um dos maiores esquemas de sonegação fiscal já descobertos. Suspeita-se que três quadrilhas operavam dentro do colegiado, causando um prejuízo de pelo menos R$ 6 bilhões aos cofres públicos.

O Carf é um tribunal administrativo formado por representantes da Fazenda e dos contribuintes (empresas). Normalmente, são julgados pelo conselho empresas autuadas por escolherem estratégias tributárias que, segundo a fiscalização, estão em desacordo com a lei.

De acordo com os investigadores, formados por conselheiros, ex-conselheiros e servidores públicos, as quadrilhas buscavam anular ou atenuar pagamentos cobrados pela Receita de empresas que cometeram infrações tributárias, e que eram discutidos no conselho.

As investigações começaram em 2013 e alcançam processos de até 2005. Elas indicam que os grupos usavam o acesso privilegiado a informações para identificar “clientes”, contatados por meio de atravessadores, na maioria das vezes escritórios de advocacia e contabilidade.

A operação focou em 70 processos “suspeitos de terem sofrido manipulação”, que somavam R$ 19 bilhões em “créditos tributários” –valores devidos ao Fisco. A PF diz que “já foram, efetivamente, identificados prejuízos de quase R$ 6 bilhões”.

A Operação Zelotes ocorre em trabalho conjunto da Polícia Federal, Receita Federal e Procuradoria da República do Distrito Federal.

Procurado pela reportagem, o Instituto Lula disse que não se pronunciará sobre o caso.

A CAOA informou que Carlos Alberto de Oliveira Andrade esteve na PF na condição de “testemunha-informante” e que a empresa jamais contratou ninguém para atuar na aprovação de medidas provisórias.

Acrescenta que, em se tratando do Carf, os dois recursos de seu interesse foram rejeitados pelo colegiado.

A Mitsubishi disse que “já vinha colaborando com as investigações”, “pois a empresa tem todo o interesse em esclarecer os fatos”.

Ex-chefe de Comunicação Social do Senado, Mesquita disse que nunca tive conhecimento de transações envolvendo medidas provisórias. “Não tenho a menor influência no Senado nem nunca pedi a qualquer senador sobre como votar.”

Ele também nega que tenha recebido dinheiro. “Nunca recebi esse dinheiro. Não faz sentido”, afirmou.

A Folha deixou recado na secretária eletrônica de Lytha Spíndola, mas ele não retornou a ligação até o momento.

A Teologia da Libertação não foi mera brincadeira de teólogos liberais e marxistas, como um delírio momentâneo. A maioria de seus adeptos NUNCA soube que ela não nasceu primeiramente em Medellín, na Colômbia, em 1968, na conferência de bispos latino-americanos esquerdistas.

Mihai Pacepa, tenente-general do serviço secreto de espionagem romeno (DIE), esteve presente no processo de criação desse OVO DE SERPENTE, nascido dentro da KGB a mando de Nikita Khrushchev, sucessor de Stálin na União Soviética. Pacepa participava de perto das atividades do serviço secreto russo no mundo latino-americano. Inclusive organizou algumas missões para cá.

Ele conta em seu livro, intitulado DESINFORMAÇÃO, como Khrushchev chocou esse ovo, tudo santificado pelo propósito público de eliminar a pobreza. De quebra, sua missão secreta teve sucesso: incitar os pobres latino-americanos contra a “violência institucionalizada da pobreza gerada pelos EUA” e iniciar movimentos vermelhos – que culminou nas vitórias de presidentes eleitos: Chavez, Maduro, Morales, Lula, Dilma, Kirchner, Mojica, Zelaya, Ortega, etc.

A KGB sempre teve uma quedinha por movimentos de libertação. Eles criaram a Organização para a LIBERTAÇÃO da Palestina, o Exército de LIBERTAÇÃO Nacional da Colômbia (FARC) e o Exército de LIBERTAÇÃO Nacional da Bolívia, entre outros. A TL foi mais um deles.

A conferência de bispos, então, conseguiu levar a ideia da TL para o Conselho Mundial de Igrejas (WCC), a fim de aprova-la oficialmente, coisa que conseguiram. A partir daí, em 1971, começaram os primeiros congressos católicos latino-americanos dedicados à TL – o primeiro em Bogotá. O resto é história até chegarmos ao evento das CEBs, em Londrina.

Nota: São João Paulo II, que viveu as mazelas do comunismo, em 1979, DENUNCIOU a TL na conferência de janeiro no Conselho Episcopal Latino-Americano (CELAM). Disse ele: “Essa concepção de Cristo como uma figura política, um revolucionário, um subversivo de Nazaré, não corresponde de fato ao catecismo da Igreja.”

Infelizmente, apesar de TODOS os papas, desde Pio IX, condenarem o comunismo e, por extensão, a Teologia da Libertação, há quem julgue ser possível viver como católico e comunista ao mesmo tempo; ser católico e promotor dessa teologia vermelha.

Será que precisarei citar em latim o decreto de Pio XII, de 1949, o terror dos vermelhinhos chineludos?

1390,2,,"O teólogo e escritor Leonardo Boff criticou o governo de Michel Temer e manifestou solidariedade ao ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, condenado sem provas no processo envolvendo o triplex no Guarujá. “Pessoalmente acho que a Justiça e o governo como um todo estão perdendo o sentido dos limites. Estão provocando o povo: criando as condições para que um povo aviltado não aguente mais e comece uma convulsão incontrolável. A culpa não é do povo. É da justiça injusta e perseguidora”, escreveu Boff, em sua conta no Twitter.

“Lula era convidado pela ONU para discutir a fome na Etiópia. Juizinhos mesquinhos, sem noção do mundo, tiraram-lhe o passaporte. Eles nos fazem passar vergonha. Hoje somos objeto de irrisão internacional, tão degradada é nossa justiça”, acrescentou.

O juiz no Distrito Federal Ricardo Leite, que determinou a apreensão do passaporte de Lula, já foi afastado da Operação Zelotes suspeito de atrapalhar as investigações e se tornou alvo de investigação da Corregedoria por esse motivo. A Corregedora Nacional de Justiça, ministra Nancy Andrighi, determinou em agosto de 2015 a notificação do magistrado por causa de uma representação feita pelo relator da subcomissão da Câmara dos Deputados que acompanha as investigações sobre o esquema de corrupção no Conselho de Administração de Recursos Fiscais (Carf), deputado federal Paulo Pimenta (PT-RS).

Leite indeferiu os pedidos de prisão temporária de 26 investigados e não concedeu a prorrogação do monitoramento das escutas telefônicas e de e-mail dos envolvidos. Além disso, o juiz determinou o sigilo das investigações, pois, segundo ele, “provocaria desnecessária exposição da intimidade dos investigados perante os meios de comunicação”.

Em maio do mesmo ano, a Corregedoria do Tribunal Regional Federal da 1ª região já havia acatado representação do Ministério Público Federal contra o magistrado. Dados do Portal da Transparência revelam que, em 2014, a 10ª Vara Federal do DF – que está sob responsabilidade de Ricardo Leite – teve 499 processos julgados, enquanto, no mesmo período, a 12ª Vara teve 1537, número três vezes superior.

Eles estão desmontando o Prouni, com o Fies, com as escolas técnicas”, criticou Lula. “Eles inventaram uma doença chamada PT que provocava a ascensão dos mais pobres. As pessoas não queriam mais andar de ônibus, queriam andar de avião”, acrescentou.

Lula comentou também o artigo publicado no New York Times que denuncia a parcialidade do juiz Sergio Moro e o risco à democracia brasileira caso Lula seja condenado.

“Se tem uma coisa que não me conformo é o complexo de vira-lata, inclusive da imprensa brasileira.

“Eu duvido que os jornalistas que escrevem mentira a meu respeito e que o William Bonner durmam todo dia com a consciência tranquila. Eles sabem que eles estão mentindo”, prosseguiu.

“Só uma coisa vai me tirar das ruas desse país e será o dia que eu morrer. Até lá estarei lutando por uma sociedade mais justa”, ressaltou. “Qualquer que seja o resultado do julgamento, eu seguirei na luta pela dignidade do povo nesse país”, completou.

Lula disse “precisar que o povo participe para que a gente possa recuperar esse país”. E acreditar que “a esquerda vai se reunir não em torno de um candidato, mas em torno de um projeto”.

1393,1,,"’ve been writing articles for far-right websites in the US for a year now. I didn’t set out to do this; it started in October 2016, when I was finishing my PhD in London. My funding ran out, and I started writing content to pay the rent. I found clients through websites that allow potential writers to bid for work, and then build a portfolio of reviews from clients. There is an enormous amount of work available – everything from writing product copy to ghost-writing novels.

The first jobs I got were pretty shady. I was writing fake Amazon reviews and descriptions of perfume that had yet to be produced. A reliable client put me in touch with a colleague who runs a number of websites, one of which focuses on news about, and reviews of, guns.

I have never seen a gun, let alone used one, but I took the job. The site carries reviews of handgun accessories, and for each product there is a link to Amazon. My client gets paid for every click-through he generates through Amazon’s affiliate scheme. There are vast numbers of such sites: I’ve written fake reviews of amplifiers, baby products, printers and sex toys.

At first, I was paid $20 for 1,000 words. As the site began to make more money, I got paid more; I now get triple my original rate. I have never met my client, but we talk once a month to set priorities. He is young, American and not into guns. We write under a number of pseudonyms that are designed to look trustworthy to right-leaning American gun enthusiasts: generally, retired men with links to the military. I write for about 15 hours a week, and make £2,400 a month. I don’t have a contract, or any guarantee of ongoing work, but it suits me. I am still finishing that PhD.

Recently, we’ve tried to boost the site up the Google rankings. This involves writing for other sites that are visited by gun enthusiasts, a lot of them pretty extreme, and sneaking in a link to our own site. This is against their rules, so you have to hide the link deep in the middle of a dense paragraph, so no one notices.

I write articles arguing that banning bump stocks, which enable semi-automatic guns to fire more rapidly, won’t prevent mass shootings and that the left skews statistics. I believe the opposite to be true. I vehemently disagree with what I write, and with the sites I write for. I often despair at the ignorance on display. Only once have I written for a site that was racist. There was an article about “them”, referring to black people. That was the only time I’ve questioned what I do for a living.

But I don’t have a moral problem with it. I wish I had some snappy argument about why what I’m doing is not wrong. I’m furthering ignorance, certainly, and perhaps contributing to an atmosphere of hatred. But I don’t think people have died as a result of my work. Perhaps I am more nihilistic than most, but in the end, it’s a job and it pays well.

I have never made up a statistic, invented a story, or been racist. I think I would refuse to do so. I see my role as providing an extreme right-wing interpretation of breaking news. Though I do not believe the stories I write, I don’t count this as lying.

I suppose the articles I write would be regarded as fake news. Though that has got a lot of attention recently, I think it is merely a new term for an old phenomenon. This type of ideologically driven journalism pre-dates the internet and perhaps even the printing press: what were Der Stürmer, Pravda and Trajan’s Column, if not fake news?

Ultimately, I feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to assess critically everything they read: my articles are designed to sell gun accessories; newspaper articles are designed to sell newspapers. I don’t see that much difference between the two.

My friends know what I do for a living, and find it amusing. There is an absurd humour in a young(ish), left(ish), British arts student pretending to be a far-right, middle-aged, American gun enthusiast. They recognise that my earnings give me the freedom to live and work where I want.

I’ll continue to work for this client for at least another six months, by which time I will have finished my PhD and saved enough to go travelling. Then I’ll get my first proper job in five years. If my rate continues to increase, though, I’ll continue to write for this client. It’s easy money

1394,2,,"➤ Incidentrapporter från Kista bibliotek som Samhällsnytt har fått ut återspeglar ett allt mer desperat säkerhetsläge där bibliotekarier inte känner sig trygga ens om de är två. Hot, våld, bråk och IS-propaganda har blivit vardag för personal på ”Sveriges bästa bibliotek”.

Tidigare i år kunde Samhällsnytt rapportera om ett knivslagsmål på biblioteket i Kista – som av den numera avgångna i sviterna av #metoo s-politikern Roger Mogert kallades ”Sveriges och världens bästa bibliotek”. En del av dem som kommenterade artikeln i sociala medier menade då att slagsmålet som kunde ha slutat med ett mord hade varit ett undantag i ett annars fridfullt bibliotek.

Samhällsnytt har begärt ut en sammanställning av incidentrapporter på biblioteket mellan september och december i år. Sammanställningen som omfattar en förhållandevis begränsad tidsperiod innehåller flera hotfulla incidenter och fysiska angrepp mot bibliotekarier.

Den 10 december skrev en besökare ut flera sidor och betalade inte för utskrifterna vilket man ska göra på ett bibliotek:

”När jag sa till honom att han måste betala för utskrifterna reagerade han kraftigt som om han blivit provocerad, gick nära och höjde rösten, knuffade mig och försökte rycka bort min tagg” – beskriver den drabbade bibliotekarien händelsen.

En annan incident inträffade den 22 november när några besökare spelade musik högt via sina mobiler:

”Därefter kommer en person fram till mig som själv talar arabiska och viskar att det personerna spelar är kampsånger med våldsbejakande texter och han ber mig att säga till personerna att stänga av.”

Bara en månad senare har en person som surfat på ”mycket våldsamma IS-sidor” på samma bibliotek påträffats. Enligt incidentrapporten skrev personen ord som ”skjut”, ”döda” samt tittat på en våldtäkt utförd av IS-terrorister. Detta var inte första gången som besökaren surfat på IS-sidor på bibliotekets publika datorer.

”Besökaren har även varit aggressiv mot besökare och personal vid tidigare tillfällen”, anmärker rapportförfattaren.

Vid ett annat tillfälle den 5 september blev en bibliotekarie hotad oprovocerat och kallad rasist:

”Jag sitter i stolen på barnavdelningen. En smal kille, 14-15 år gammal, kommer från ingenstans, snabbt, med en käpp liknande föremål i handen och går runt mig en hel ring, ansiktsuttrycket hotfullt och frågar ”Är du rasist, eller?”. Jag blir förvånad, han går (tror jag)  och plötsligt kommer han tillbaka och går en cirkel till runt mig, mycket nära mig och sedan runt barn i avdelningen. En annan kraftig kille i samma ålder tittar bara, smala killen kallar honom men han kommer inte i närheten. Jag känner mycket starkt obehag efter senaste oprovocerade attacker, särskilt när han har ett käpp i handen och går till info disken för att ringa till vakterna men killarna försvinner på en gång.”

Det verkar inte vara helt riskfritt att slappna av i bibliotekets hängmatta heller: enligt sammanställningen blev en man av med sina skor när han låg i hängmattan. Det har även stulits mobiltelefoner och en iPad på biblioteket.

Den 3 november kissade en man på golvet framför läktaren på bibliotekets stora scen, somnade därefter och fick föras ut av Securitas-vakter. Händelsen klassas dock som ett miljöproblem eftersom ett pöl med kiss låg kvar på golvet i tre dagar trots att en ansvarig i lokalfrågor informerades.

Säkerhetssituationen i biblioteket uppfattas av anställda som så pass ansträngd att det skrivs en separat incidentrapport när bara två anställda närvarar vid bibliotekets öppning då de övriga är försenade:

”Personligen ville jag inte öppna biblioteket för jag anser att det är orimligt att vi ska vara två personer vid öppning”.

1398,1,,"A sus 102 años, Neus Català es una de las pocas supervivientes del Holocausto que ha podido asistir a la colocación de una  stolperstein en su honor. Un adoquín que recuerda a las víctimas del régimen nazi. Ha sido este jueves en  Els Guiamets (Tarragona).

La vieja luchadora catalana tiene sobre sus espaldas una historia de película: defendió la República frente a la sublevación franquista, combatió más tarde en las filas de la Resistencia francesa contra los nazis y acabó en el campo de concentración de Ravensbrück donde realizó numerosos sabotajes en la fábrica de armas en la que ingresó como trabajadora forzada. Este jueves, en silla de ruedas, con gruesas gafas de pasta, pero con un aspecto saludable ha sido testigo, en la puerta de la que fue su casa en la localidad tarraconense, del momento en que el artista alemán Gunter Demnig instalaba una piedra de memoria en su honor. Debido a su avanzada edad Neus no ha intervenido en el acto, pero ha emocionado a los asistentes cuando, escuchando una canción que interpretaba Marina Rosell, se ha arrancado espontáneamente a cantar algunas estrofas.

Ha sido el primer acto de la apretada agenda que Demnig va a desarrollar en Cataluña durante los próximos días como parte de su proyecto  Stolpersteine. Una iniciativa que, desde que se puso en marcha en 1993, ya ha sembrado 20 naciones europeas con más de 60.000 de estos adoquines coronados con una placa de latón en la que se graba el nombre y los datos personales de cada víctima del nazismo.

En octubre del pasado año este monumento global salió por primera vez del viejo continente y llegó hasta Buenos Aires para recordar a un grupo de niños judíos que tuvieron que viajar a Argentina escapando de la persecución a la que les sometía el III Reich. Resulta complejo españolizar el término  stolpersteine, aunque según sus promotores lo más correcto sería hablar de ""piedras de tropiezo"" porque el objetivo es que quien se encuentre con ellas se tropiece con la Historia y con la Memoria. Más fácil es resumir su fin utilizando el mantra que mueve a Demnig: ""Una persona solo es olvidada cuando su nombre es olvidado"".

La presencia del artista alemán en Cataluña ha sido coordinada por el Memorial Democratic y forma parte de los actos con motivo del Día Internacional de Conmemoración en Memoria de las Víctimas del Holocausto. Tras la colocación de la piedra en honor de Neus Catalá, Demnig visitará este viernes nada menos que diez pueblos: Torà, Sanaüja, Tarroja de Segarra, La Prenyanosa, Les Oluges, Cervera, Granyena de Segarra, Talavera, Sant Antolí-Ribera d’Ondara y Olesa de Montserrat. En cada uno de ellos, se instalará una  stolperstein por cada vecino deportado a los campos de concentración nazis.

El viernes las  stolpersteine ""brotarán"" en Sabadell. Un total de 23s piedras serán colocadas en recuerdo de los otros tantos paisanos de esa localidad que pasaron por los campos de la muerte de Hitler. Demnig tendrá que desplazarse por todo el municipio porque, tal y como se contempla en su proyecto, cada piedra quedará colocada frente al último domicilio en el que residieron antes de su deportación. En el caso de las víctimas españolas del nazismo, se trata de la casa en que vivían antes de tener que huir hacia Francia para escapar de las tropas franquistas.

Ese fue el primer paso de un camino que, tras las conversaciones mantenidas entre el régimen franquista y la cúpula nazi, condujo a casi 10.000 españoles y españolas a campos de concentración como Mauthausen, Buchenwald, Ravensbrück, Dachau, Sachsenhausen o Auschwitz. Demnig culminará su labor durante el domingo y el lunes en los que colocará siete adoquines en Granollers y otros dieciséis en Girona.

En España este monumento transfronterizo solo está presente en Cataluña. Ya en 2015 Demnig colocó las primeras  stolpersteine en nuestro país, concretamente en la localidad barcelonesa de Navàs. Durante 2016 y 2017 se realizaron algunos otros actos aislados, pero nunca antes se había llevado a cabo una instalación tan masiva como la que se va a ejecutar durante los próximos días.

En el resto de España algunas asociaciones han colocado, por su cuenta, una serie de  stolpersteine que, pese a no formar parte del proyecto original de Demnig, persiguen el mismo objetivo. El trabajo más intenso en este campo es el que está realizando el colectivo La Ilusión de Errentería que ha instalado un total de catorce piedras de tropiezo en memoria de otras tantas víctimas guipuzcoanas del nazismo. La Ilusión también colocó otra  stolperstein en la localidad francesa de Hendaya, en memoria del deportado socuellamino Luis Perea Bustos que sobrevivió a Mauthausen y residió en ese municipio fronterizo hasta su fallecimiento, en julio de 2014. En la ciudad de Madrid un grupo de activistas e historiadores lleva más de un año intentando que la capital se sume al proyecto que creó Demnig hace exactamente 25 años

A notícia do crime, que está sendo investigado pela Polícia Civil, foi recebida com tristeza e revolta pelos movimentos e organizações populares, diante da crescente onda de violência no campo que atinge trabalhadoras e trabalhadores camponeses em todo o Brasil.

Em nota, o MST destaca a importância da liderança e se solidariza com familiares, amigos e toda a militância do movimento.

Toda nossa rebeldia quando matam um Sem Terra

É com pesar e revolta que recebemos a triste notícia do assassinato do companheiro Márcio Matos (33), dirigente do MST e referência política na luta pela terra no estado da Bahia. Marcinho, como era conhecido, foi morto na noite desta quarta-feira (24), em sua casa, localizada no Assentamento Boa Sorte, em Iramaia, na região da Chapada Diamantina. Segundo relatos dos familiares e amigos, o dirigente foi morto com três tiros na frente de seu filho.

Natural de Vitória da Conquista, no sudoeste baiano, tornou-se uma das principais lideranças Sem Terra no estado, conhecido pela articulação com os partidos de esquerda, movimentos e organizações populares. No MST, assumiu a direção nacional ainda jovem e permaneceu na tarefa por oito anos, se destacando pelo perfil de mobilizador das massas.

Pai, camponês, filho da classe trabalhadora e comprometido com a transformação social, Marcinho assumiu, no último período, a Secretaria de

Administração de Itaetê e contribuiu diretamente com a Esquerda Popular Socialista (EPS), corrente interna do Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT).

Muitas das conquistas que tivemos nos últimos anos, Márcio esteve como um dos idealizadores, colocando em prática princípios como a solidariedade e o companheirismo, sem deixar passar despercebido valores forjados no bojo das lutas, como a sensibilidade política, a compreensão, o diálogo e uma incansável capacidade de se indignar com as injustiças.

A morte do companheiro se soma a um triste cenário nacional de violência contra os trabalhadores e trabalhadoras do campo. 2017, de acordo com a Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT), foi um ano sangrento. “O contexto vivido pelos povos da terra, das águas e das florestas exigiu teimosia, resistência e questionamento sobre o papel do Estado”, explica a entidade. Diante disso, aponta alguns dados parciais sobre a violência no campo. Segundo a Comissão foram 65 pessoas assassinadas em conflitos no campo, em muitos casos com requintes de crueldade, índice que confere ao Brasil o título de país mais violento às populações camponesas no mundo.

O cruel assassinato de Marcinho nos lembra que há cinco anos perdemos o companheiro Fábio Santos, que também era dirigente desta organização. Fábio foi assassinado com 15 tiros na frente de sua companheira e filhos, no percurso que realizava entre a sede do município de Iguaí ao distrito de Palmeirinha, ambos no Sudoeste da Bahia. Até então, ninguém foi preso e a impunidade persisti.

Este é um momento de luto, mas também de luta. Por isso, exigimos que a Justiça inicie imediatamente as investigações sobre o assassinato de Márcio. Não permitiremos que essa morte passe em puni e daremos continuidade a luta popular travada por ele nas diversas trincheiras.

Nos solidarizamos com os familiares, amigos e toda militância Sem Terra que encontra-se mobilizada nos assentamentos e acampamentos espalhados pela Bahia e juntos faremos nosso choro de repúdio ser escutado. Por isso, seguiremos em marcha, de cabeça erguida, contra o capital, o agronegócio e em defesa do Socialismo, para que o sangue dos trabalhadores, que pinta nossa bandeira de rebeldia, seja um dos motivos há mais que temos para permanecer em luta.

Considerando que os senhores nos ameaçam

Com fuzis e com canhões

Nós decidimos: de agora em diante

Temeremos mais a miséria do que a morte.

1401,1,,"Cerca de 800 famílias que vivem em seis acampamentos na região de Barra de Cunhaú, em Canguaretama – RN, foram despejadas e tiveram suas moradias destruídas e queimadas. A região é conhecida por sua especulação imobiliária, ou seja, são territórios que servem de estoque para serem vendidos no futuro, na perspectiva de aumentar seu valor de mercado e ter maior lucro. Nesse sentido, esses terrenos deixam de cumprir sua função social, seja para moradia ou para a produção agrícola, servindo apenas para uma reserva de valor e tornando-se mercadoria.

Para Cícero Araújo do setor de direitos humanos do Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST) “existe uma especulação imobiliária muito intensa capitaneada por empresas estrangeiras, belgas inclusive, por latifundiários e políticos locais que têm interesse nesses terrenos. Por outro lado, existe um contingente de famílias que demandam terras para serem desapropriadas, que sirvam ao interesse social, reivindicando seu direito constitucional á moradia”.

O processo de reintegração de posse aconteceu no mês de janeiro de 2018, mas vem sendo postergada desde 2017 em negociação com o governo do RN, além de ter tido todos os recursos de defesa indeferidos pela jurisdição de Canguaretama, culminando na não permanência das famílias no território. Durante o despejo não houve nenhum apoio e nem proteção social da Prefeitura aos desabrigados, pelo contrário, “foi feito acordos com o oficial de justiça e o comando de polícia, mas que não foram cumpridos, por exemplo, o acordo de termos um prazo de 1 hora para retirar os materiais das famílias acampadas, mesmo esse prazo não tendo vencido, os tratores destruíram e queimaram os materiais dos moradores, violando não só um acordo, mas os direitos humanos” comenta Cícero Araújo.

Ronaldo Maia, advogado popular, relata que “essa situação é muito difícil para todas as famílias, porque veem suas casas sendo destruídas, na qual houve situações de abusos em que os bens das pessoas foram queimados e isso será constado nos autos, tendo em vista a importância de mostrar como esses processos de reintegração de posse são abusivos, como eles são violentos para a classe trabalhadora. Para além de uma discussão de posse e de propriedade em relação a essas terras, há um debate político, há uma demanda social por moradia, e não pode ser tratada essa questão simplesmente sob um olhar civil e jurídico, tem que ser olhada a partir de um olhar político do poder público”.

1402,1,,"Teresa Leitão é deputada estadual de Pernambuco pelo Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT). Atua como presidenta da Comissão de Educação e Cultura da Assembleia Legislativa de Pernambuco (Alepe), suplente nas Comissões de Finanças, Orçamento e Tributação e de Ciência e Tecnologia e vice-líder da bancada de Oposição. Nesta entrevista ao Brasil de Fato Pernambuco conversou sobre os desafios para o ano, além dos cenários estaduais para as eleições 2018.

Brasil de Fato: Em um ano tão decisivo como 2018, quais são os desafios diante de disputas eleitorais tão importantes, sobretudo em Pernambuco?

Teresa Leitão: Todo esse contexto do golpe vai ser um divisor de águas durante esta campanha, que evidentemente terá como foco principal a candidatura de Lula. Então, isso vai se desdobrar nos estados. Aqui em Pernambuco, nós estamos discutindo no PT reafirmando a deliberação do nosso Congresso de apresentar uma candidatura própria. Uma vez que nós temos três nomes apresentados, o nome que tem feito movimentações mais fortes, com o apoio de movimentos sociais e vários diretórios municipais é o da vereadora do Recife, Marília Arraes. Que, inclusive é o nome que estou apoiando.

Lula e Dilma sempre foram muito bem votados aqui, independente de apoio de governo ou não. Isso não é determinante, um exemplo disso foram as eleições de 2014, quando o governo apoiou Marina no primeiro turno e Aécio no segundo turno, Lula e Dilma saiu com a vitória esmagadora aqui no estado. Na composição das chapas proporcionais, eu vou postular a reeleição, consciente de que será uma eleição muito difícil para o PT, mas ao mesmo tempo uma eleição onde teremos uma tarefa política de maior relevância. Acho que ninguém pode pensar somente em si nesta eleição. Vai ser um pleito eminentemente político, mais do que os outros, por conta deste contexto de golpe.

Quais são as pautas previstas para a Comissão de Educação e Cultura este ano?

Nesses três primeiros anos, a Comissão teve uma pauta muito focada nas reformas - sobretudo pós golpe -  que foram implementadas pelo Ministério de Educação. A última foi a Base Nacional Comum Curricular, antes tivemos a Reforma do Ensino Médio e muitos processos que foram desmontados quando o ministro Mendonça assumiu o ME. A Comissão de Educação também contabiliza uma vitória muito grande na relação aqui com o Governo do Estado, que foi a prorrogação do concurso público para professores.

Nós temos um número altíssimo de contratos temporários e esses contratos além de receberem menos do que um professor, eles não têm acesso ao plano de cargos, que é uma valorização profissional. Também vamos dar sequência a análise dos processos que foram investigados pela CPI dos Cursos Irregulares. Nós entregamos o relatório, a CPI concluiu seu trabalho, mas nós continuamos recebendo denúncias de outras entidades que continuam burlando a boa-fé dos estudantes. E focar na relação com o Governo do Estado na implementação do piso salarial dos profissionais de magistério, que é reajustado todo ano. Essas são as mais urgentes, mas sabemos que a educação tem uma dinâmica própria e podem surgir outras demandas que a comissão vai abraçar, com certeza.

Como estão as movimentações aqui em Pernambuco sobre a Lei da Escola Sem Partido?

O próprio nome é uma distorção, porque já não tem partido na escola, tem proposta pedagógica. Então, quem defende o partido fundamentalista é quem prega que a escola não deve ter partido. Vinculado a isso, tem a lei da mordaça também, que tenta proibir professores de tratar certos temas. E isso vai de encontro a Constituição. A escola tem que escolher sua proposta pedagógica, mas a liberdade de Cátedra existe. A autonomia das escolas de formularem os seus projetos, evidentemente de acordo com a legislação, e com tudo que existe do ponto de vista de diretrizes e bases para a educação. Mas, a escola sem partido nega tudo isso.  E a Assembleia tem dois lados sobre esse assunto.

Como você avalia a possível composição do Partido dos Trabalhadores na Alepe?

O PT hoje tem três deputados, um número razoavelmente baixo para o tamanho do partido. Mas, temos boas candidaturas. Eu acho que ou a gente mantém ou a gente amplia. Mas, depende muito também da composição que a gente fizer. Por exemplo, uma composição com o PSB, vai ser muito negativa para nós, porque o PSB tem 14 deputados – treze no exercício e um licenciado – então, é difícil a gente concorrer com esse tamanho.

Em termos de coligação, a comissão da direção estadual está conversando com os partidos de acordo com a deliberação nacional: partido do centro-esquerda, partidos que não tenham participado do golpe, partidos que não estejam apoiando as medidas restritivas e de retirada de direitos do governo Temer. Nós já conversamos com o Avante, com o PCO, vamos conversar com o PSOL e com o PCdoB - apesar do PCdoB fazer parte do governo Paulo Câmera, é um aliado importante em nível nacional. Daqui para Março ou Abril acho que essas coisas estarão definidas.

Na eleição estadual, muitas especulações sobre possíveis coligações ou se o PT terá candidatura própria. Qual a sua avaliação e posição sobre isso?

Eu vou repetir uma coisa que eu ouvir Lula dizer: o PT nesse momento, o que ele mais precisa é da sua militância para defender o partido. O PT tem resistido. São quatro anos de massacre e o PT tem resistido graças, sobretudo, a sua militância. Então, desprezar a opinião dela em um momento com esse é muito desastroso. A nossa militância e não apenas os seus dirigentes, estão absolutamente convictos que a candidatura própria é o melhor caminho. O PT precisa dessa disputa para dar um palanque a Lula sem constrangimentos e sem tantas contradições. A contradição faz parte da política, mas a incoerência é muito mal vinda para determinados momentos, como o de demarcação de campos, que estamos vivendo hoje. Acredito que o que vai prevalecer é a tese da candidatura própria.

Precisamos moldar essa tese para que ela seja um apoio importante a candidatura de Lula. Não que Lula necessariamente precise disto aqui, mas é importante que ele tenha esse palanque e que ele seja de muita identidade. Nós também precisamos de Lula. E o que Lula nos colocou foi isso: vamos seguir com a tese da candidatura própria. Por isso, é bom que o PT defina logo qual é o seu nome. E o nome de Marília é o que eu vejo com mais volume dentro do partido. E lá na frente se não der, ai é outra coisa. Mas, esse “se não der” tem que ser muito bem construído, porque você não pode afogar a militância. O importante nesse momento é formular o nosso programa de governo, ir para rua discutir o programa que foi lançado pelo PT nacional, “O Brasil que o povo quer”, e ir aglutinando forças políticas que podem ajudar a eleger Lula, Marília e as bancadas do PT.

1403,1,,"Rede Globo prepara mais um exercício de manipulação para enganar incautos

26 de Janeiro de 2018 às 08:00

Não se pode garantir desde já a manutenção da regras do jogo

Quer dizer que a TV Globo, useira e vezeira em manipular a informação com o objetivo de enganar os incautos, está conclamando os seus telespectadores no sentido de mandarem um vídeo de alguns segundos para comentar sobre o que desejam para o Brasil. A campanha para o envio de mensagem parece que os seus idealizadores estão lidando com debilóides ignorantes no manejo de celulares.

Mas isso é apenas uma parte do que vem por aí. Não é necessário nenhuma bola de cristal para adiantar o que ocorrerá em matéria de manipulação, até porque, como é costume do esquema Globo, não serão apresentadas mensagens que eventualmente entram em choque com o pensamento retrógrado da família Marinho. Os leitores por acaso imaginam o que fariam os editores se recebessem uma mensagem dizendo que “o Brasil seria muito melhor e mais saudável se não tivesse a Rede Globo para enganar os brasileiros incautos?”

Somente as mensagens de interesse do esquema Globo serão divulgadas. E, portanto, podem imaginar o que vem por aí e com o objetivo de na prática ajudar o candidato que mais estiver sintonizado com o esquema Globo. Podem ser Geraldo Alckmin, Henrique Meirelles e, dependendo de um milagre de aparecer melhor nas pesquisas, o patético Rodrigo Maia.

Quem tiver dúvidas sobre o que está sendo previsto aqui, basta acompanhar, se tiver estômago, o noticiário do Jornal Nacional a partir do momento da divulgação das mensagens. Mas a TV Globo pensa que engana os brasileiros e as brasileiras minimamente conscientes em relação à manipulação da informação.

Para combater realmente a manipulação, só resta mesmo que o candidato à Presidência do país se comprometa a regular a mídia, exatamente para evitar o que vem acontecendo há tempos por aqui. Essa perspectiva provoca pânico na família Marinho, que tem feito o possível para na base da mentira divulgar que quem defende essa perspectiva estimula a censura, quando ocorre exatamente o contrário, ou seja, regulamentar a mídia, algo comum em vários países ocidentais, significa democratizar a informação.

Tudo isso é por demais óbvio, sobretudo em um momento em a opinião pública está sendo convocada para escolher democraticamente quem vai suceder o lesa pátria Michel Temer, galgado de forma golpista à Presidência da República, inclusive executando um projeto repudiado pelo menos quatro vezes nas urnas.

Não se pode garantir desde já a manutenção da regras do jogo. Se os golpistas de 2016 sentirem que correm perigo vão tentar de tudo para evitar o veredicto  das urnas. Não se trata de um exercício de futurologia, mas apenas a constatação do óbvio, ou seja, o temor do julgamento pelo povo do projeto que vai executando Temer e sua patota vinculada ao mercado financeiro.

A Globo, por sinal, é uma das mídias que mais apoia esse projeto e está fazendo o possível e o impossível para a sua manutenção, custe o que custar, inclusive convocar incautos para enviarem suas mensagens, como a campanha já iniciada no Jornal Nacional.

1404,1,,"Outra vez eu me sirvo deste menino que faz o tal Tijolaço para ser meu cambono. Medíocre, é verdade, mas é quem está à mão, fazer o quê?

Para ver se revolvia a sua terra pouco fértil, mandei-lhe uma emanação, aqui do éter, para que ouvisse o que falei no enterro do Gláuber Rocha. Claro que não porque você esteja morto, como eu e ele, mas porque te quero sugerir que, como ele, esta noite, chore.

Eu disse lá: “O Gláuber chorava, chorava convulsivamente. O Gláuber chorava a dor que todos devíamos chorar,  a dor de todos os brasileiros. O Gláuber chorava as crianças com fome, O Gláuber chorava um país que não deu certo, o Gláuber chorava a brutalidade, a mediocridade, a estupidez”…

Pois então, meu caro Lula, sinta-se livre hoje para chorar. Não por você, que sei, por já ter tido a sua idade e um câncer como você, sei que não liga mais para si mesmo. Nem eu, que me amava tanto e tão profundamente, dava muita importância a mim, a não ser pelo que podia fazer, dizer e escrever. E nesta ordem.

Chore, Lula, chore. Mas chore só hoje.

Que amanhã, como você se acostumou, é dia de ir cedo para a fábrica. Porque é muito parecido, não é? Moldar ideias é como moldar metais: é duro, cheio de asperezas e sujeito a acidentes que nos machucam. E é pior, até, porque não tem descanso, nem fim de semana, e a falta de uma rede nos faz doer as costas de macunaímas.

Lula, os estatutos desta gafieira onde me encontro – não sei se é celeste ou infernal, porque não entendo um céu sem pecados e nem um inferno sem virtudes – impedem-me de te revelar o futuro.  Posso apenas te dizer que não é fácil como o de quem morre e vira santo, porque depois que a gente desencarna, até os cínicos nos aplaudem.

Quando a gente está vivo, nos acusam de tudo. A mim, usaram uma foto para dizer que eu me aliava a banqueiros do jogo do bicho. Como é que eu ia ser Secretário de Cultura do Rio de Janeiro, fazer o Sambódromo e cuidar do Carnaval sem encontrar os bicheiros das Escolas de Samba?

Nos limites em que Deus controla minha língua – sou justo, não me reprime nos diálogos que travamos, porque Deus é onisciente mas aceita a dúvida, ao contrário dos bobalhões togados que te condenaram hoje, posso te contar só um pouquinho.

Posso contar, apenas, o que já escrevi, e mando este menino que cavalgo mentalmente agora, vá buscar no meu “O Povo Brasileiro”:

Cada vez que um político nacionalista ou populista se encaminha para a revisão da institucionalidade, as classes dominantes apelam para a repressão e a força.

Eu mesmo sofri isso, como auxiliar de Jango. Só me deixaram voltar aos Brasil quando acharam – como vão achar você – prestes a morrer de um câncer que me levou um pulmão. Por isso, te digo, o que é ser preso perto de estar na iminência da morte?

Não é a primeira vez que escrevo sobre você. A primeira foi quando ainda estava por aí, em 1989, e desabafei:

Estou me cansando de ouvir falar de Lula com descaso. Qualquer advogadinho idiota, porque formado, se acha melhor que ele, mais preparado para governar. Um intelectual desses que leu meia dúzia de livros ou escreveu qualquer bobagem, um tecnocrata que desempenhou bem ou mal algum cargo, todos se acham melhores que Lula e falam dele sem sombra de respeito. Por que? Essa gente pensa que o exercício do poder, em postos de alta responsabilidade, cabe a uma categoria particularíssima de pessoas, na qual não incluiriam jamais um ex-operário ou um líder sindical, ainda que muito bem-sucedido.

Não errei, não é?

Nem eu nem você quisemos ser mártires – e eles, os grandões, também não querem, porque não há mídia que seja capaz de vencer mártires.

Mas estes caras são tão imbecis, tão idiotas, que nos fazem isso. Como eles são filhos e netos de senhores de escravos, acham que nos atar ao tronco e vergastar, vai encher de medo a senzala.

Na hora, sim, que ninguém é bobo de querer o chicote no lombo, mas lhes vai endurecendo o couro das mentes e  deixando que elas não aceitem mais a servidão.

Então, Lula, chore esta noite e acorde amanhã livre de rancores. Como um negro fugido, que os capitães de mato querem enjaular, seja sabido.

Eles verão um nordestino, que mal escapou de ser gabiru, virar ainda mais gigante.

Agora, por favor, não me obrigue mais a estas comunicações psicográficas e deixe que eu as reserve para a Dona Diva, aquela negra linda da Feira Literária de Parati, que é linda e 20 e tantos anos mais nova que eu -que a Catherine Deneuve nos abençoe.

Quando eu mandar, daqui, uma edição revisada de O Povo Brasileiro, prometo, cuido do que você é, a metamorfose ambulante com que se define.

Mas, antes, estou observando a borboleta voar.

1405,1,,"“O Judiciário (do Brasil) assume o papel de assessor do golpe. Uma decisão extremamente politizada. Apesar de os juízes tentarem mostrar que respeitam a democracia, foi uma grande farsa, a segunda parte da farsa desde o impeachment”, definiu Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, ex-ministro de Direitos Humanos de Fernando Henrique Cardoso, em entrevista para a Rádio Brasil Atual, pouco após o término do julgamento no Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região (TRF4) que manteve a condenação do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

“Realmente foram sentenças inacreditáveis. Eles não conseguiram achar nenhum defeito na sentença do Moro, que já era um escândalo”, afirmou. Para Pinheiro, a impressão é que os três juízes combinaram os votos, além de terem se “arvorado” como defensores da democracia, algo que, na opinião dele, é totalmente fora de contexto.

“Não é só uma decisão inaceitável, mas certamente gravíssima na perspectiva de um Judiciário independente. Essa decisão confirma que no atual Judiciário do Brasil não há condições de Lula ser examinado por uma Justiça equânime. Nos Estados Unidos se chama isso de 'tribunal canguru', quando já se sabe que o réu está condenado”, afirmou Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, que desde 1995 tem desempenhado diversas funções na Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU), entre elas, a de presidente da Comissão Internacional de Investigação para a Síria.

Pinheiro disse acreditar que a sentença dada nesta quarta-feira (24) pelo TRF4, ajudará no pedido da defesa do ex-presidente Lula feito ao Comitê de Direitos Humanos da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU). “Com todas as irregularidades, vai chamar a atenção dos membros do Comitê para essa decisão eminentemente política.”

O ex-coordenador da Comissão Nacional da Verdade (CNV) ainda ponderou que a sentença de Lula não repercute apenas na Europa ou outros países, mas é um péssimo precedente para o sistema de justiça de todo o continente latino-americano. “Não há a menor dúvida que essa sentença combinada visa tirar Lula das eleições.”

Para o ex-ministro de FHC, é preciso haver uma grande mobilização para impedir que o golpe se fortaleça cada vez mais. “Se a sociedade ficar imóvel, os grupos que avançam em direção a um governo totalitário só irão se fortalecer.”

1406,1,,"Em entrevista ao Brasil de Fato, o advogado Antonio Escrivão Filho, professor da Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de Brasília (UnB), criticou a decisão da 10a Vara da Justiça Federal do Distrito Federal (DF), que determina a apreensão do passaporte do ex-presidente Lula e o proíbe de viajar ao exterior.

O professor aponta como um dos problemas o fato de o juiz Ricardo Leite, autor da decisão, ter baseado sua decisão no caso triplex para justificar a liminar. O caso não é objeto de apreciação de Leite, o que o impossibilitaria de tomar tal atitude.

""O juiz deu uma decisão fundamentada em argumentos que não foram franqueados pela defesa para que ela se defendesse. A defesa não chega num processo judicial e se defende de tudo o que acontece no mundo. Ela se defende do que foi acusada"", argumenta Escrivão Filho.

Leite cuida do processo que está no âmbito da 10a Vara Federal do DF, em que Lula responde por suposto tráfico de influência na compra de aviões militares suecos por parte da Força Aérea Brasilia (FAB), entre 2013 e 2015, durante o governo de Dilma Rousseff (PT).

Diante disso, o professor, que também é membro da Frente Brasil de Juristas pela Democracia, avalia que a liminar teria um caráter ""autoritário"".

""O processo judicial volta dois séculos e passa a ser um processo inquisitorial, em que a acusação tem à sua disposição qualquer argumento retórico para, então, forjar aí uma narrativa de acusação. Não importa o que a defesa tenha a dizer. É a acusação que interessa. Essa é a forma da Inquisição"", acrescenta.

Escrivão Filho também aponta que a liminar retrocede em relação aos avanços conquistados pela sociedade contemporânea.

Por fim, o jurista avalia que a decisão extrapola os limites do poder dos magistrados.

""A função de um juiz em um Estado Democrático de Direito é uma função política, mas ele não pode julgar com parâmetros políticos. A função dele tem que ser pautada no processo, nas regras processuais. Essa decisão tangencia o autoritarismo"", classifica.

Lula tinha uma viagem agendada para a madrugada desta sexta-feira (26) para a Etiópia, na África, onde iria participar de uma reunião da Organização das Nações Unidas para a Alimentação e a Agricultura (FAO). Ele não embarcou para o país. Cristiano Zanin Martins entregou nas manhã desta sexta-feira (26), à Polícia Federal, em São Paulo, o passaporte de Lula.

Na nota divulgada à imprensa, Zanin se disse ""estarrecido"" com a decisão. Ele criticou duramente a liminar e disse que o TRF-4 havia sido informado sobre a viagem do petista à Etiópia e não impôs restrição.

""O ex-presidente Lula tem assegurado pela Constituição Federal o direito de ir e vir (CF, art. 5º, XV), o qual somente pode ser restringido na hipótese de decisão condenatória transitada em julgado, da qual não caiba qualquer recurso, o que não existe e acreditamos que não existirá porque ele não praticou qualquer crime"", completou.

1407,1,,"A maioria dos bairros da Região Metropolitana do Recife tem algum grupo que joga uma “pelada” em algum campo da localidade. E tem também algum projeto que trabalha o esporte como ferramenta de mudança social. Pensando em integrar essas comunidades e, por consequência, descobrir novos talentos, que a Taça Recife de Comunidades – TARECO chega a sua quinta edição.

A competição acontece no mês de janeiro e funciona no sistema de mata-mata: todas as equipes se enfrentam. Quem perder está fora da disputa. Em 2018 tem novidade no regulamento, agora a competição está dividida em série A e série B. Na primeira divisão, jogam as 16 equipes que ficaram nas melhores posições na disputa do ano passado. E para a série B, as outras 16 que perderam e mais outras 16 que serão escolhidas através das inscrições feitas pelo site. Para se inscrever é só acessar o site http://www.tarecofutebol.com.br, colocar todos os dados do projeto e esperar uma visita da equipe organizadora. Os requisitos são estabilidade e seriedade do projeto.

A TARECO tem o apoio da Central Única das Favelas - Pernambuco (CUFA PE) e da Federação Pernambucana de Futebol (FPF PE). A competição acontece entre 32 comunidades do Recife, Olinda e Jaboatão. Participam mais de 1000 jovens entre 13 e 15 anos. Para o coordenador de comunicação da CUFA-PE, Guilherme Dias, o campeonato é muito importante para a vida social das comunidades “é um momento que nós conseguimos fazer com que os meninos que estão de férias, sem ter muita opção do que fazer, tenha uma atividade produtiva e que integra com outras localidades”, conta.

Na competição passada, a comunidade de Vila Cardeal, após jogos difíceis e disputas de pênaltis conquistou o seu bicampeonato contra a equipe do Campo do Banco. Todas as finais são disputadas no campo do Derby e, na verdade, todas as equipes saem ganhando. “Temos muitas comunidades que eram “rivais” e que com esse trabalho se enfrentam em campo e até visitam os campos adversários, sem nenhum problema. Isso é muito significativo”, ressalta Guilherme.

1408,1,,"Nos últimos dias o Brasil entrou em ebulição com diversas atividades de mobilização, escrachos e vigílias na expectativa para o julgamento e condenação do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT). Diante do cenário de perseguição política que se montou em torno da figura dele, o resultado do julgamento já era esperado, no entanto, isso não retirou dele e nem do povo a vontade de elegê-lo, mais uma vez, presidente da república.

O golpe em curso no país, após retirar a presidenta democraticamente eleita Dilma Rousseff (PT), retira os direitos dos trabalhadores, ameaça a previdência pública, privatiza a Petrobras, bem como tenta fazer com a Chesf, sucateia os bancos públicos e deforma a educação. A cartada final é tornar Lula inelegível em 2018.

Por isso, para impedir a candidatura de Lula vale tudo: condenação no tribunal de Porto Alegre durante período de recesso, proposta de semiparlamentarismo e até adiar as eleições. Fica evidente de que se trata de uma perseguição totalmente política, que só será derrotada no terreno da política.

Diante disso, a Frente Brasil Popular e os diversos movimentos populares e organizações políticas que a compõem organizaram um calendário de lutas em defesa da democracia e do direito de Lula ser candidato. Aqui em Pernambuco, a movimentação ocorreu no Recife com a etapa metropolitana da II Caravana Popular em Defesa da Democracia e de Lula que entre os dias 12 e 24 de janeiro organizaram uma série de atividades, entre ato político-cultural, café da manhã, lançamento de comitê, organização de troça carnavalesca e a distribuição de material explicando as irregularidades do processo pelo qual Lula foi julgado no dia 24.

Do litoral ao sertão o povo pernambucano se organizou pra mandar o recado ao judiciário de que “eleição sem Lula é fraude”. Caruaru, Afogados da Ingazeira, Serra Talhada, Petrolândia, Ouricuri e Petrolina foram alguns desses locais onde houve também adesivaço, vigília, e mobilizações diversas. Além das tantas outras milhares de pessoas que ocuparam Porto Alegre para tensionar o Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª regional (TRF-4) e mostrar a força povo contra esse sistema judiciário arbitrário.

Toda esta movimentação tem a ver com a memória coletiva que o povo tem da melhoria de vida durante os governos de Lula e Dilma, entrar na universidade e andar de avião pela primeira vez, ter energia elétrica e uma cisterna, não há juiz que faça esquecer. Portanto, apesar da condenação, a esperança de uma vida melhor é mais forte e é o que faz nossa gente permanecer nas ruas lutando em de defesa Lula, porque ele representa a síntese da classe trabalhadora.

Vivemos um período difícil, é preciso restaurar os direitos sociais que estão sendo perdidos com esse golpe ou então seremos derrotados e assistiremos a definitiva implantação de uma sociedade neoliberal com seu irrestrito pacote de maldades. Portanto, é necessário permanecer em defesa da candidatura de Lula pois defendê-lo é defender a democracia.

1409,1,,"Se o governo e a Câmara dos Deputados tentarem pôr em votação a “reforma” da Previdência no dia 19 de fevereiro, como têm anunciado, o Brasil terá a maior greve geral de sua história. A declaração foi feita pelo presidente da CUT, Vagner Freitas, nesta quinta-feira (25). A central foi anfitriã da reunião da direção do PT que oficializou hoje a indicação do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva para a disputa presidencial em outubro.

“Temos que fazer uma rebelião para garantir o Estado Democrático de Direito e não vamos deixar os capitalistas rasgarem a Constituição. Eles serão derrotados nas ruas se não recuarem. Vamos desautorizar o TRF4”, avisou Vagner, associando a luta pelo direito de Lula de disputar a eleição à luta em defesa dos direitos dos trabalhadores. “A CUT nasceu defendendo a democracia e, por isso, este é o local adequado para este ato de resistência aos ataques golpistas contra os trabalhadores e contra Lula.”

Para o presidente da central, a decisão do Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região (TRF4) de manter a condenação do ex-presidente trouxe ainda mais insegurança jurídica e social para o Brasil, que desde o golpe de 2016 também vem atravessando um grande revés econômico.

“Será que os capitalistas brasileiros, que foram os pais do golpe, acham que vão ter condições de crescer com o país arrebentado e com os trabalhadores descontentes?”, questionou. “Vamos fazer greve nos bancos de vocês, vamos fazer greve nas empresas de vocês, vamos fazer greve no agronegócio. O desempenho das empresas vai cair ainda mais, porque vocês arrebentaram as relações de trabalho e ganharam ainda mais insegurança jurídica. E a greve do dia 19 será ainda maior do que a de 28 de abril, quando milhões de trabalhadores cruzaram os braços.”

Coordenador nacional do Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST), João Pedro Stédile defendeu, minutos antes, além da greve no dia 19, uma agenda prolongada de resistência à consolidação do “golpe” que tenta tirar Lula da disputa. “No TRF4 o jogo era deles, deixando mais claro que o Poder Judiciário é contra o povo, que não tem compromisso com o Brasil. Isso não vai nos intimidar. Saímos mais revigorados”, afirmou.

O líder do MST disse ainda que “quem escolheu Lula como candidato foi o povo e não o PT”, mandando outro recado ao Judiciário e aos golpistas: “Não pensem que vocês mandam no país. Nós vamos impedir que Lula seja preso”. Stédile disse que, além do 19 de fevereiro, as ações do Dia Internacional da Mulher, no 8 de março, também terão essa abordagem de resistência em defesa de Lula, da democracia e dos direitos.

Ao lado de Raimundo Bonfim, coordenador da Central de Movimentos Populares (CMP), Stédile anunciou ainda que a Frente Brasil Popular – integrada por CUT, CMP, MST e outras dezenas de entidades – realizará “congressos populares” no maior número possível de cidades do país. O objetivo é ampliar a organização pela resistência nas ruas e discutir projetos para o Brasil “junto com o povo”. Os passos seguintes seriam a realização desse eventos em nível estadual, em julho.  “Vamos encher o Estádio do Maracanã, no Rio de Janeiro, para definir a plataforma nacional dos trabalhadores.

Raimundo Bonfim reforçou que o povo brasileiro não vai se aquietar. “Não vamos respeitar a farsa construída ontem pelo Judiciário. Não há outro caminho senão o povo nas ruas, senão a desobediência civil. Se eles não respeitam a Constituição de 1988, também não serão respeitados”, afirmou, referindo-se ao uso do sistema de Justiça para criminalizar as forças populares e a política.

Lula foi condenado em segunda instância a 12 anos e 1 mês de prisão pelos crimes de lavagem de dinheiro e corrupção. A pena anterior, determinada pelo juiz Sérgio Moro, era de 9 anos e 6 meses.

O Brasil se tornou um feitor, foi humilhado pelos senhores da casa grande

Na época da escravidão a figura do capitão do mato sintetizava o que existia de pior em termos humanos. Era o responsável por exercer o poder desumanizador de forma sempre violenta. O mais sujo de todo o trabalho era um misto de subserviência, admiração e medo. O capitão do mato se submetia ao patrão como um rato, queria ser como ele em seus sonhos de emancipação de sua vida ordinária e temia ocupar o lugar da pessoa que martirizava. Por outro lado, tinha a capacidade de reunir em si tudo que era mais desprezível num ser vivo, alimentando o desprezo dos senhores, o repúdio dos cidadãos e o ódio dos escravos.

O Brasil do golpe é um capitão do mato, tendo como patrão o capitalismo internacional, mais especialmente, os Estados Unidos e o que eles representam. Simbolicamente, a autodenominada elite defende valores de mercado, como os americanos; elogia a imprensa livre, como a gringa; incensa a justiça independente, como a estadunidense. No entanto, em sua sanha mimética excessiva, costuma errar na mão e recolher apenas o escárnio pelo arremedo que acaba por produzir: um mercado protegido, uma imprensa partidária, uma justiça de classe.

O pior desse diagnóstico é que ele vem embalado por declarações dos próprios modelos que se busca emular. Documentos oficiais, notícias e artigos de opinião produzidos por autoridades, juristas e jornalistas norte-americanos, em torno do julgamento de Lula em segunda instância, dão conta da vergonha de nosso infeliz destino de capitães do mato do neoliberalismo. Para quem de imitar se orgulhava, o resultado pífio da paródia custa agora a vergonha internacional.

Em poucos dias, o Brasil se tornou um feitor, foi humilhado pelos senhores da casa grande do Norte global. Em pelo menos três dimensões.

Na primeira, a diplomacia. O congresso americano, por meio de uma dúzia de deputados do Comitê de Relações Exteriores, enviou uma carta ao embaixador brasileiro, Sergio Silva do Amaral, manifestando sua preocupação como o respeito aos direitos básicos de Lula durante o julgamento. O documento chama atenção para o risco de o Brasil passar por cima de compromissos assumidos em tratados internacionais. O tom é de desconfiança. De nada adiantou o Brasil ter desviado o rumo de sua diplomacia independente e altiva e se alinhado de forma inferiorizada aos interesses norte-americanos, sob José Serra e Aloysio Nunes. Recebeu um pito e uma reprimenda. Capitães do mato das relações exteriores.

A segunda humilhação veio da imprensa. O principal jornal estadunidense, New York Times, secundado por várias outras publicações, deixou claro que o jornalismo brasileiro vem fazendo um papelão. Não noticia com independência, é avesso à pluralidade, não entende de liberdade. Mesmo o mais capitalista dos países sabe que uma imprensa livre é um valor para democracia. Na verdade, é uma de suas condições. O artigo publicado no NYT é um puxão de orelhas na imprensa venal, que deixou os fatos de lado para construir teses e defender bandeiras políticas como se fossem racionais, como o caso da reforma da previdência. A cobertura do julgamento de Porto Alegre foi a mais vergonhosa demonstração de sabujice da história. Os jornalistas prelibavam, babavam e se confraternizavam em frente às câmeras. Capitães do mato do jornalismo.

A terceira estação de nossa submissão constrangedora veio do próprio campo judicial. As demonstrações dadas durante todo o processo, que apontavam orgulhosamente a inspiração na jurisprudência americana, sobretudo por Moro e pela força tarefa da Lava Jato, ficou à mercê de um passa-fora dos juristas daquele país. Em várias manifestações, ficou patente a estranheza com o rito seguido no Brasil. Não foram poucos os que disseram que o sistema judicial de outros países não aceitaria como válidas diversas ações do juiz de Curitiba, referendadas e até elogiadas pelos desembargadores da TRF4. As decisões – e atos de instrução e investigação do processo – seriam rejeitadas de pronto pela maioria das cortes do mundo. A suspeição do juiz foi tida como evidente, além da incompreensível junção das tarefas de investigar e julgar exercidas pela mesma pessoa. Capitães do mato da justiça.

O representante do ex-presidente Lula em processo na Comissão de Direitos Humanos da ONU, o advogado britânico Geoffrey Robertson, também criticou o arremedo de julgamento em Porto Alegre. Entre outras observações, estranhou o fato de o promotor Mauricio Gotardo Gerum se sentar junto e ter conversas particulares com os desembargadores. Confirmando a impressão de que se encenava um teatro de cartas marcadas – e não um momento em que um colegiado independente analisa uma sentença proferida em outra instância – ficou perplexo com o orgulho dos julgadores em chegar à sessão com votos de centenas de páginas, minuciosamente coincidentes em argumentos e aumento das penas, na mesmíssima dosimetria. Capitães do mato da desfaçatez.

Os artífices do Estado de exceção implantado no Brasil tinham como horizonte a lei, a justiça e a imprensa norte-americanas. Tomaram bomba nas três, em notas conferidas pelos próprios bedéis. Deram prova ao mundo que o país desrespeita regras internacionais, que não opera a justiça com respeito aos direitos fundamentais e que tem a pior imprensa do mundo.

Depois dizem que Lula foi o maior derrotado.

1412,1,,"A festa dos orixás vai desfilar nas ruas de BH neste fim de semana. Acontece no Centro de Referência da Juventude (CRJ), dos dias 26 a 28 de janeiro, a VII Chamada de Afoxé. O afoxé é a junção de dança, instrumentos de percussão (atabaque, agogô, xequerê) e músicas em português e também em Iorubá, uma das línguas faladas na África.

A integrante do grupo de capoeira Lenço de Seda (CECAB), Ana Maria Maia, que participa da organização, explica que o afoxé literalmente significa “a fala que faz acontecer”. Belo Horizonte teve um grupo de Afoxé de 1980 a 1988, o Ilê Odara, mas fundou após a morte de Mãe Gigi. O evento “Chamada de Afoxé” nasce em 2011 e traz novamente a tradição para a capital mineira.

O evento tem como mentor o Mestre Moa do Katendê. Ele é um dos fundadores do Ilê Odara e também fundador do Badauê e do Amigos do Katendê, afoxés de Salvador. O mestre é compositor, dançarino, capoeirista, artesão, ogã (chefe) percussionista e educador, natural de Salvador. Hoje faz oficinas de afoxé em diversos estados do país e na Europa.

Segundo Rômulo Marcio, da Companhia de dança Motumbá, que também organiza o evento, a Chamada é aberta a todas as pessoas que estão buscando “um novo caminho de comunhão com as pessoas da própria cidade. É o afoxé da paz”. Para pagar os custos, os organizadores fazem uma rifa no valor de R$10 de um berimbau e um atabaque, e contam com a doação voluntária de apoiadores.

Na sexta (26) acontece a abertura, às 19h, com o “Círculo de Saberes – Entre a Fé e o Direito. Debate das políticas públicas e as práticas religiosas de matrizes africanas”. No sábado (27) é realizada a Oficina de Ritmo, Canto e Dança com Mestre Mao do Katendê, das 9h às 18h. E no domingo (28), os participantes saem em cortejo, junto ao Centro Nacional de Africanidade e Resistência Afro-Brasileira (CENARAB), contra a intolerância religiosa e pela Democracia. A concentração é às 13h em frente ao CRJ e cortejo às 15h, rumo à Praça da Liberdade. “Participe, venha de branco”, convoca a chamada. Todo o evento é gratuito.

1413,1,,"O comportamento apresentado pela grande mídia brasileira na cobertura do julgamento do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, na última quarta-feira (24), serviu de motor para a campanha conservadora que pede a condenação do petista. A conclusão é do coletivo Intervozes — entidade que atua pela garantia do direito à comunicação no Brasil —, que monitorou a cobertura dos principais canais de TV e veículos impressos de circulação nacional nos últimos dois dias.

De acordo com a coordenadora-executiva do coletivo Bia Barbosa, na mídia televisiva, teve destaque, mais uma vez, a conduta das Organizações Globo. Ela realça a cobertura do canal de TV por assinatura GloboNews, que transmitiu o julgamento durante toda a quarta-feira.

Ao longo do dia, a emissora destacou as falas dos três desembargadores que julgaram o caso e, após o resultado, o posicionamento da acusação, representada pelo Ministério Público Federal, sem, no entanto, apresentar a defesa do ex-presidente. As manifestações da defesa foram ao ar somente na programação noturna da emissora.

O monitoramento constatou, por exemplo, que a primeira declaração do advogado de Lula, Cristiano Zanin Martins, foi ao ar às 21h08min, depois de 1h30min de duração do jornal.

Para Bia Barbosa, a conduta demonstra uma tentativa de sufocar o conflito existente em torno dos argumentos da acusação. ""É inconcebível você pensar que um telejornal que vai fazer uma síntese do julgamento não traga a fala dos acusados. O único motivo que justifica eles não terem soltado essas falas [antes] é uma escolha editorial"", aponta.

Outro caso constatado pelo monitoramento é o que aponta que o ex-presidente Lula apareceu na GloboNews somente às 22h06min. O julgamento tece início às 8h30min. O desequilíbrio, segundo Bia Barbosa, fere o direito à informação, que trata de uma garantia constitucional e diz respeito ao exercício da cidadania.

""Se eu ligo um telejornal e só assisto nele o que disseram a acusação e os desembargadores e não fico sabendo os argumentos da defesa, certamente tendo a formar minha opinião aderindo às teses que foram divulgadas. Quando você recebe uma visão parcial do que aconteceu, esse direito [à informação] está sendo claramente violado"", explica.

No caso do Jornal Nacional, transmitido pelo canal aberto TV Globo no período noturno e considerado o telejornal de maior audiência no país, a cobertura se concentrou nas falas dos três desembargadores, cujo discurso esteve mais voltado para as acusações. Bia Barbosa salienta que, novamente, o jornal agiu com desequilíbrio diante do caso.

A coordenadora-executiva aponta ainda que a fala do ex-presidente veiculada pelo Jornal Nacional trata de uma declaração em que o petista afirmava que o processo carecia de provas e que, por conta disso, ele ganharia ""de 3x0"" no julgamento. A declaração ganhou, na leitura do Intervozes, um tom irônico diante do contexto geral da edição do jornal e da notícia mais forte do dia, que trazia um placar exatamente inverso.

""A escolha dessas aspas foi pra deslegitimar a fala dele. Ela tem um simbolismo no sentido de tratar o Lula como alguém que estava completamente 'fora da realidade'"", critica Barbosa.

O coletivo Intervozes também realizou uma análise similar, publicada nesta sexta-feira (26), em relação a grandes jornais impressos de cobertura nacional: Folha de São Paulo, Estadão e O Globo.

Ana Mielke, também coordenadora-executiva do coletivo, destaca o que chama de ""criminalização da resistência"". Segundo ela, a assimetria de tratamento entre as partes deu o tom do debate e conduziu a cobertura não só para o sufocamento das vozes dissonantes, mas também para a criminalização daqueles que discordam do discurso oficial apresentado pelo Ministério Público Federal (MPF) e pela Justiça.

""O discurso dos jornais tem legitimado as decisões da Justiça como se elas fossem infalíveis e não fossem questionáveis, como se estivessem acima de qualquer suspeita. Esse discurso criminaliza a discordância e não tem apego nem mesmo entre os cientistas políticos"", critica Mielke.

Outro aspecto de realce na cobertura, segundo o Intervozes, seria a tentativa dos jornais de convencer a opinião pública sobre uma suposta necessidade de condenação de Lula para levar à estabilização da economia. Mielke aponta que tal argumentação não poderia ser considerada ""concreta"".

""A grande mídia se utilizou desse argumento pra tentar gerar empatia na população, mas quais são os dados que reforçam essa argumentação? São estritamente especulativos, ou seja, vêm do mercado financeiro. São um espectro, quase uma assombração"", complementa.

O professor César Bolaño, da Pós-Graduação em Comunicação Social da Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS), considera que a cobertura apresentada pelos grandes jornais em relação ao julgamento do ex-presidente Lula compromete as boas práticas do jornalismo e os próprios valores democráticos. Ele acrescenta que o problema está diretamente relacionado à alta concentração da propriedade dos meios de comunicação no Brasil.

""A informação é muito controlada. Não se tem nem uma diversidade de veículos com posições diferentes e nem uma diversidade dentro dos veículos. Estamos diante do pior dos mundos do ponto de vista da mídia hegemônica"", finaliza.

1414,1,,"Um grupo de advogados teve o pedido de apreensão do passaporte do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva negado pelo desembargador João Pedro Gebran Neto, do Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região (TRF4), de Porto Alegre, nesta sexta-feira (26).

Gebran se baseou no entendimento de que somente o Ministério Público Federal (MPF), a Policia Federal e outras partes do processo poderiam fazer tal pedido, classificado por ele como “inusitado”, já que dos advogados são estranhos ao processo que corre na Justiça contra o ex-presidente.

O desembargador foi relator do chamado Caso Triplex no TRF4, que confirmou a condenação de Lula em segunda instância e aumentou a pena de nove anos e seis meses para 12 anos e um mês de prisão.

A decisão do desembargador, no entanto, não interfere no pedido do juiz federal Ricardo Leite, da 10ª Vara Federal do Distrito Federal , que, nesta quinta-feira (25), ordenou a retenção do passaporte do ex-presidente e o proibiu de sair do país.

Lula viajaria nesta sexta-feira para a Etiópia, onde participaria de um evento da Organização das Nações Unidas para Agricultura e Alimentação (FAO).

O doutor em direito pela Universidade de São Paulo (USP) e membro da Associação Brasil de Juristas pela Democracia Thiago Barison avalia que mais uma vez a Justiça fez uso político de suas atribuições com essa decisão.

“Restringir o direito de ir e vir de Lula para uma viagem a convite da ONU, de conhecimento prévio de todos, é um descalabro cometido pelo juiz Ricardo Leite da 10ª Vara de Brasília, que assim atua politicamente de modo descarado, invadindo a competência jurisdicional do TRF4"", afirmou.

O jurista destacou que a medida tem o objetivo de censurar o ex-mandatário: ""O objetivo é impedir que Lula fale. Parece o caso do Giordano Bruno, em que foi posta uma mordaça"", afirmou. O advogado se refere ao teólogo italiano do século 16 que, defensor do conceito de que a verdade deve prevalecer sobre as crenças e um dos inspiradores do movimento iluminista, foi julgado e queimado na fogueira pela inquisição em 17 de fevereiro de 1600.

Barison fez coro à fala do advogado de defesa de Lula Cristiano Zanin, para quem a decisão da 10ª Vara Federal de Brasília representa “uma restrição do direito de ir e vir do ex-presidente Lula, que não se justifica”.

O passaporte do ex-presidente foi entregue na manhã desta sexta-feira na Superintendência da Polícia Federal em São Paulo. A defesa de Lula pretende reverter a decisão. Como esta se deu no Distrito Federal, sua possível revisão também deve ser resolvida na Justiça Federal da capital do país.

1418,3,1.0,"There's always a few of them in every game, and even though we give the New England Patriots all the credit for winning this one and grinding it out for an incredible comeback victory, there were certainly some questionable officiating decisions that hurt the Jaguars. Then again, both teams had their fair share in this one, and it's just the nature of a fast-paced game. Let's take a closer look at some that were complete misses.

Third-and-seven at the Patriots 44-yard line and Blake Bortles hits Marcedes Lewis for a huge first down before the two-minute warning leading into half time! Great play, except it never counted due to a questionable delay of game penalty. They were not able to convert in the ensuing play and the Pats took over to score before the half. If it were to go the Jags way, they would have been in field goal range with a chance to take the second quarter all the way down. That one call accounted for a possible 10-point swing or more.

This could have been a game-changer. With a 10 point lead at the start of the fourth quarter, LB Myles Jack made an incredible play to force a fumble, and seemingly had an open path to the end zone for a possible TD return. However, the refs errantly blew the play dead, costing the Jags what could have been a pivotal six points. The Jags went three and out on the ensuing drive, and gave the ball right back to New England. This could've changed everything.

With the Pats down three in the fourth quarter and little over six minutes left, Brady heaved a pass down the sideline to Brandin Cooks that was way under thrown, forcing Jalen Ramsey and Cooks to have to slam the breaks to come back to the ball. A physical battle led to a pass interference call and a huge penalty that flipped the field and eventually led to the go-ahead score. Ramsey had his head turned toward the ball and was trying to make a play on the ball, as was Cooks. Tough break for the Jags.

This one will debated for the entire game, as the majority of personal foul hits on defenseless receivers are, but it looked like Barry Church led with the left shoulder on a great hit to dislodge the ball from Rob Gronkowski. The hit was flagged as Gronk was hurt on the play, which eventually forced him from the game. The result of it all was the Pats marching down the field and cutting the 14-3 deficit to just four points heading into the half. That was the turning point of the game.

We don't know which calls were missed. We don't know which ticky-tack, could-go-either-way calls were ignored.

But we DO know that the New England Patriots somehow weren't called  for a single offensive or defensive penalty in this scrum, only succumbing to one single ding on a punt return. The New England Patriots certainly committed a penalty or two in this game. To not see them penalized even once? That's not ""bias"". That's delusion.

Living in Seattle definitely has its perk – Today, I went to check out the new Amazon Go store that just opened yesterday (1/22/2018). It is situated right in the heart of downtown Seattle by the Amazon Sphere. This automated mini-market is one of its kind and the first in the world. Walk in with a phone in hand (no credit card & no cash), take whatever I want, and then just walk out! Literally, no line, no cashier, and not even a self-checkout station. It was so convenient! Because today is the 2nd day since opening to the public, most people in the store were more interested in taking pictures, videos, and discussing the technology behind this 1,800 sq. ft. retail space. Who wouldn’t right? After about 5 – 10 mins, I got a notification on my phone and it was a receipt from Amazon Go. After confirming I got charged correctly, it then charged the credit card I input when I first got the app.

You may wonder what kinds of things are being sold at Amazon Go. Basically, they have grocery essentials like bread, milk, cheese, and wine (of course). What I personally love is all the ready-to-eat varieties – salmon teriyaki with rice, steak with salsa salami, salad, sandwiches, and etc. They also carry local items from Seattle such as Rachel Ginger Beer and Eat Local (frozen food). Only a few things are unique to only Amazon Go – “Just Walk Out Shopping” mug, Amazon Go Vacuum Insulated bottle, Theo/Amazon Go chocolate, and Amazon Meal Kits.

Technology-wise, Amazon Go did a really good job hiding all the advanced technology such as sensor allowing me to shop seamlessly. It’s barely noticeable – unless you look up! Then, you will see lots of tiny cameras.

Overall, Amazon Go did not disappoint and I am still excited after walking out the store. I guess I have a place to go get lunch even if I forgot my wallet at home! Thank you, Amazon Go.

Things you might not know about Amazon Go:

There are “subway” gates right when you enter the store for you to scan your QR code from your phone.

Amazon Go app records how long you take to shop.

Can’t share your QR code by taking a screenshot. It won’t let you. Not EVERYTHING is automated with advanced technology. There are people working in the store to make ready-to-eat food, stock shelves, and help customers. A person will also check your ID when you go into the alcoholic beverage section.

1423,3,1.0,"Do you ever feel—despite the supposed economic ""recovery"" of recent years—that something in America is still not quite right?

If so, you are not alone.

After all, how can things be ""OK"" when nearly half the men ages 18-34 now live with their parents—the highest level since the Great Depression?

How can it be ""normal"" when in one of America's richest cities (Seattle) there are now 400 unauthorized homeless camps under bridges and along freeway medians?

How can it be a ""recovery"" when 78% of the U. S. population now lives paycheck to paycheck, with essentially zero savings?

How can you explain things like the dramatic rise of the militant left-wing group ‘Antifa'... the resurgence of White Supremacists... and the booming popularity of the Democratic Socialists—they've doubled membership in recent months.

Sure, some people—CEOs, tech entrepreneurs, and other members of the ""1%""—are doing great. There's never been a better time for wealthy Americans. But the truth is, for most people, the situation is getting much, much worse.

Today I want to share a few facts our politicians are afraid to tell you—including the secret reason why working class Americans have gotten dramatically poorer over the past 40 years.

I've never seen this information published anywhere else. It's a secret that explains why the rich are really getting so much richer—while everyone else is falling behind.

Once you understand this secret, you'll see why, for millions of Americans, a crisis is coming.

I'm talking about a political event unlike anything we've seen in our country in nearly 50 years.

It will ""reset"" the financial system in ways most Americans can't imagine—and for most, it will be a national nightmare.

This secret I'm going to share with you protects the very rich and powerful. So they'll never reveal it.

But I'm going to explain it as clearly and simply as possible right now...

Why are so many Americans so angry?

Hi, my name is Porter Stansberry.

You may not know me, but nearly 20 years ago, I started a financial research and education business called Stansberry Research.

Today we have offices in the U. S., Hong Kong, and Singapore. We serve more than half a million paid customers in virtually every country (172 at last count). We have nearly 500 employees, including dozens of financial analysts, corporate attorneys, accountants, technology experts, former hedge fund managers, and even a medical doctor.

But what really sets us apart in the financial industry is our independence. We don't accept advertising. And we don't manage money.

So we're not hamstrung like major newspapers who can't offend advertisers. And we're not beholden to politicians for financial licenses. We operate under the protection of the First Amendment—so we can afford to be brutally honest about whatever is most important to our subscribers.

Today I'm contacting you with a serious warning: We've hit a serious tipping point in America.

Our nation, as I'm sure you've noticed, has become a financial, cultural, and demographic pressure cooker.

You've seen it in the riots and protests in Charlottesville, Ferguson, Milwaukee, and Baltimore.

VP Mike Pence walked out of this NFL game. What are these protests really about? And what's coming next? The answers are below...

You've seen it in mass shootings... the attacks on college campuses... the arguments about immigration... and the refusal of NFL players to stand for the national anthem.

These uprisings and protests may be nominally about race.

But what they're really about, underneath it all, is money... and hopelessness.

Now, you might hear the mainstream press and politicians talking about ""wealth inequality"" when referencing our country's social problems and political polarization.

But what they don't tell you is that the growing disparity between rich and poor in America is a symptom of our problem... not the root cause.

Yes, today the richest 10% of America owns 75% of the nation's wealth... a level we have not seen since the 1930s. Just look at the chart below...

So what's the real problem then?

Well, it isn't that a small number of Americans have done well. The real problem is how they've done well. And I'm going to explain this secret to you in just a minute: How the tremendous gains in wealth for the few have come directly at the expense of most working-class folks.

This is what's driving the anger, the radical politics, and the growing racism in our society.

You see, while the rich are getting richer, everyone else is losing ground. Look at this chart, which shows how for most Americans, real wages have been stagnant or falling for decades...

Most Americans are Getting Poorer:

The middle class—the most politically and economically stable part of our society—is disappearing.

The foundation of the middle class in America was a long history of consistently rising wages. For millions of Americans, life got a little better, year after year, as the value of their wages increased and our economy grew into the world's largest.

But this is no longer happening. Low income earners now make LESS in real terms than they did in 1980! And middle income earners make just 6% more than they made back in 1980. That's an increase of just 0.00172% a year!

Can you imagine your boss telling you for 34 straight years that you're never getting more than a 0.00172% raise each year?

No wonder people are so angry and stressed.

They've been going to work, year after year, but instead of earning more over time, they've actually been earning less, in terms of what their wages can buy.

Despite the boom in the U.S. economy and financial assets over the past 30 years—which boosted the wealth and incomes of the wealthiest Americans like never before—average Americans are actually worse off than they were decades ago.

And so, they've been forced to borrow more and more money simply to keep up.

You can see that in the data—and I'll show it to you below.

But I bet you don't even need to see the data. Just think about your friends and people you know, and how much more debt these folks have to take on, just to keep their heads above water.

It used to be that most Americans didn't hold debt, outside of a mortgage on their first home. But after almost 40 years of declining real wages, Americans now have to go into serious amounts of debt for just about everything they buy.

Americans now have more than $1.5 trillion in college debt, for example. Look at this incredible chart...

And it's not just college loans that have soared.

Americans also have more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, and more than $1 trillion in auto loan debt—all record highs.

It's gotten so bad, 73% of Americans now die with debt... with an average total of more than $60,000!

Being in debt is an incredibly stressful way to live. You're in a hole and there is simply no way out. So it's no surprise that deaths by drugs and poisoning for the bottom 60% of American's population have doubled since the year 2000... and suicide rates have doubled as well over the same period.

This is incredibly sad—and it's unfathomable that this is happening in the greatest country on earth.

Unfortunately, the problem is going to get much, much worse.

You see, tens of millions of people in America are desperate. They have no way out. And sooner or later this hopelessness and desperation are going to lead to violent and radical politics.

And this enormous political powder keg is leading to THE biggest political event our country has seen in decades. I'll explain exactly what's going to play out in just a second.

But first, like I promised above...

I want to explain the secret reason why investors and the rich have become so much richer... while so many Americans have become trapped in a cycle of poverty...

The underlying economic problem in America today is that money no longer flows to everyone equally in the way that it used to.

That much is obvious, right? As our country has gotten richer than ever... the income disparity widens every year.

But most Americans don't understand why this is happening.

The real underlying cause of our wealth and income disparity in America is that wages are no longer connected to gains in productivity.

I know that sounds like economic doublespeak, but please stick with me...

If you can grasp this concept, you will be way ahead of 99% of the population, and it will help you make a heck of a lot of money and avoid enormous losses.

So let me explain what it means. It's not complicated...

You see, back in the early part of the 20th century, economic gains were shared by both owners and workers.

Ford—and his employees—got rich boosting productivity. A  new book by Porter Stansberry explains why only corporate executives get rich today.

He got rich making the automobile affordable with the assembly line—a huge increase in productivity. And these gains in productivity flowed directly to Ford's employees. Ford made headlines across the nation when he more than doubled his minimum pay, overnight, in 1914.

But that doesn't happen anymore. Real wages have declined for most Americans, despite huge gains in productivity over the last several decades.

Look at this chart based on research from the Economic Policy Institute, which shows this problem clearly...

What's going on here?

It's not that computers are destroying our jobs. Or that we've moved jobs overseas.

As you can see, back in Henry Ford's days and decades after, productivity—a measure of how efficient we are at producing goods and services—and income gains moved hand in hand.

But then, something happened. As the Economic Policy Institute States:

""From 1973 to 2016, net productivity rose 73.7 percent, while the hourly pay essentially stagnated—increasing only 12.5 percent over 43 years... This means although Americans are working more productively than ever, the fruits of their labors have primarily accrued to those at the top and to corporate profits, especially in recent years.""

You'll notice that the divergence begins around 1971... the year President Nixon removed the U. S. dollar from gold.

Why is this important?

Because paper money printed out of thin air doesn't transmit gains in productivity like real, sound money should.

When money is sound and reliable, it doesn't lose value over time. In fact, quite the opposite—it buys more and more, because of increases in productivity and efficiency.

But the link between productivity and wages was permanently changed in the early 1970s when Nixon forever broke the link between our dollar and gold.

As a result, today our monetary system isn't sound or reliable.

Our politicians monkey around with the money supply constantly. They increase the amount of money by huge amounts, in response to demands from powerful groups—especially banks.

As a result, the things you need to live a regular life—such as gasoline, milk, housing, and medical care—constantly get more expensive. These prices go up, year after year, even when wages don't.

In other words, even though there's been an enormous amount of wealth created by our economy (look at all the huge new houses, condos, skyscrapers... and electronic cars), life for average Americans hasn't improved one bit. The average worker has gotten poorer.

Again: That's not because our economy hasn't gotten better.

Our economy has boomed through enormous increases in productivity—technologies like personal computers, cell phones, the Internet, RFID tags (for inventory control), gene sequencing, GPS, and fantastic increases to fuel efficiency.

You can see these gains in your everyday life.

But... on the other hand... everything you need to live and prosper—from food to housing, healthcare to cars and education—has gotten way, way more expensive.

Look at the price of a new Ford F-150 pickup truck, for example. It's the best-selling vehicle in America and has been for decades.

Price of a new Ford F-150 Since the 1960s

In 1969, a new truck was $2,500. But today a new F-150 costs about $30,000 for the base model. For an F-150 you'd actually want to drive, the cost is about $45,000. That's almost an entire year of after-tax wages for the average worker!

This all means some folks in America are doing great...

Look at the huge increase in the number of American billionaires. Look at how many more planes Boeing is selling... at the cars Ford and GM are selling all over the world... at the way our entertainment industry dominates movies around the world, and at the way our tech firms (Apple, Google, Facebook) rule the Internet.

That's been great for investors and for tech-savvy engineers.

But what about the average American?

These terrific gains haven't impacted most wage earners because the gains in productivity and technology didn't flow through our entire economy the way they should... the way they used to.

These gains in productivity, especially the improvements in technology, should have made our currency much stronger... and should have made everything you buy—from Ford trucks to milk—much cheaper.

But that's not what happened, as you know.

Instead, the cost of just about everything has always gone up. Way up.

That's because, no matter how big the gains in productivity are, the government—politicians and their minions at the Federal Reserve—have always created more money.

Sometimes they do it by creating a lot of new credit. And sometimes by simply printing trillions of new dollars out of thin air.

All of this new money ALWAYS causes prices to rise more than productivity.

And this is the big secret the corporate executives and politicians hope you never understand.

Because wages are no longer connected to gains in productivity... Over time... there's nothing the average American can do to stay ahead of inflation.

So most Americans have been forced to borrow—in a way that is unprecedented in our history...

U.S. consumers now have nearly $13 trillion in total debt... the highest total ever, even more than was owed right before the crash in 2007... in order to pay for food, housing, cars, education, healthcare, and other basic expenses.

We owe a trillion dollars on our credit cards—which often have interest rates as high as 28%! We've borrowed a trillion dollars to buy new cars—which plummet in value the minute you drive off the lot. And we've racked up about $1.5 trillion for college education with dubious worth.

The debt load for the working poor has nearly quadrupled in the past 20 years as a percentage of their income. And this debt can never, ever be repaid.

It's this system that dooms every average worker to poverty. And almost guarantees that the rich and the powerful will stay that way.

Simply working harder—or working smarter—isn't benefiting employees anymore. On the other hand, Americans who own assets and businesses have seen their wealth soar over the last 40 years.

And so we are left with the biggest income and wealth disparity in America in nearly 100 years.

For those who have taken on these incredible new debt loads, it's a very stressful way to live. So many Americans today are in a hole. They are extremely stressed out, and there is no way out.

And herein lies the problem.

This group is growing, and this stress and anger is building... ultimately fueling many of today's biggest issues...

The next big crisis is already underway...

Protests like the one in Charlottesville were just the beginning. Wait until you see what's coming next in America...

It's why you see people rioting in Charlottesville, Virginia...

It's why you see massive increases in violence and desperation in cities like Baltimore and Chicago...

It's why you see more and more radicalized politics—like resurgent neo-Nazi groups and the rise of Black Lives Matter...

It's why you see the tearing down of historic statues, and why according to a recent Harvard study, more than 50% of young people no longer believe in capitalism!

It's why we now have the highest-ever percentage of people on food stamps—double the historical rate.

It's why in some states, nearly 10% of working age adults receive disability payments!

Remember: These uprisings and protests may be nominally about race, or Donald Trump, police brutality, or immigration.

But what they're really all about is money, debt, and economics.

And that's why we will soon see a dramatic political and economic event, the likes of which we haven't seen in nearly 50 years...

Very soon, millions of Americans will be calling for the government to ""do something.""

Specifically, they'll be calling for a clean slate... to wipe out their debts and ""reset"" the financial system.

The crowds will cheer and march like never before. The violence will escalate. Our politicians will promise this reset of the financial system as a way to a ""new and better prosperity.""

And while it might sound like good news to those who have gotten in over their head—what will really happen is a national nightmare.

You see, this idea of erasing debts to reset the financial system is not new. In fact, in the Bible, it's referred to as a ""Jubilee.""

If you're unfamiliar with the term, it comes from The Old Testament, the Book of Leviticus, Chapter 25.

A Jubilee in the Jewish tradition was said to occur roughly every 50 years.

It was a time for total forgiveness of debt, the freeing of slaves, and the returning of lands. Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed the first Christian Jubilee in 1300.

Since then, it's been used dozens of times, when anger among a population hits extreme levels, typically because of an explosive divide between the wealthy and the working class.

And very soon, millions will be calling for a new Debt Jubilee here in America.

Believe it or not, many are already doing so...

Folks like Carla Reinhart of Harvard University and Stephen Roach of Yale have advocated for a Debt Jubilee in one form or another. So have financial pundits Barry Ritholtz and Chris Whalen.

In Congress, more than a half-dozen Jubilee-style laws have been proposed, by folks such as Rep. Kathy Castor and Senator Bill Nelson from Florida.

And many of the most powerful left-wing economic ""experts"" are calling for a Debt Jubilee by name...

London School of Economics Professor David Graeber says: ""we are long overdue for some kind of Biblical-style Jubilee... it would relieve so much genuine human suffering.""

The national affairs correspondent for The Nation says we should: ""Think Jubilee, American Style... because it combines a sense of social justice with old-fashioned common sense.""

Paul Kedrosky, a senior fellow at the Kaufman Foundation (a liberal think tank), says: ""we need a fresh start, and we need it now... we need... a Jubilee.""

A Jubilee—which wipes the slate clean for millions of the most indebted Americans and ""resets"" the financial system—is inevitable.

This trend will accelerate. The idea of a Debt Jubilee will become THE leading political issue in the months to come.

Today, for millions of Americans, there's no more powerful political promise than a Debt Jubilee. Politicians will soon be promising it all...

I will wipe out your debts.

I will allow you to start fresh.

I will reward all of your bad decisions.

I will solve America's massive income inequality.

Who will pay for it?

You, me, and millions of Americans with pensions, retirement accounts, and other types of savings.

Just as in the past, the folks in Washington will disguise this Jubilee under a different name.

They might call it a ""National Restoration"" or ""Patriotic Solvency.""

They'll pass an ""Act"" like they did in 1841... or invoke an Executive Order as was done in 1933 (Executive Order #6102)... or simply issue a mandate to the Secretary of the Treasury (which they did in 1971).

But it all means the same thing. The Jubilee will redistribute trillions of dollars from those who have invested and saved... to those who can no longer pay their debts.

So what does a Jubilee look like in the real world... how will it unfold in America... and what will it mean for you, your money, and your retirement?

Well, my research team and I have done more work on this subject than anyone else in the financial industry—and we've just finished what could become the most important book in America over the next few years.

It's called: The American Jubilee, and it explains much more about America's biggest problem today... and what you MUST do to survive and prosper in the years to come.

Today I'd like to send you a hardback copy of our new 266-page book for 60% off the regular price others will pay.

You see, I've been studying these ideas for more than 20 years, and I've been one of the lucky Americans.

My parents weren't rich. We were middle class, and lived in a modest house. We had a mortgage. But, my dad worked for Coca-Cola. And the company had an employee stock program. My dad was wise enough to buy as much stock as they would let him... for years and years.

As our country experienced a financial boom, my family benefitted because we were part of the ""asset owners"" and not just the wage earners.

That was very lucky. And it led to wealth for my parents: a second home in the mountains, travel, and college for my siblings and me.

That experience planted a seed in me.

I remember my dad checking the price of Coke stock every morning in the early 1980s. I remember thinking how incredible it was that through the stock market you could become an owner of almost any kind of business in the world, and how making the right decisions with your money could dramatically transform your life.

And so I've spent my entire adult life helping people all around the world understand how investing works... the benefits, the pitfalls... and exactly what to buy and what to avoid.

I started my investment research firm in 1999, during the last big investment mania (Internet stocks.) I helped investors profit... and get them out before the crash.

And that's exactly what we're trying to do again today.

What's coming next in our country will be a lot worse than the tech crash. It will be a lot worse than the mortgage crisis too. And I can tell you that no matter how sound your financial footing, this is the most important issue facing you and your money today.

That's why we just put together our brand-new book: The American Jubilee. It's a compilation of our best research and recommendations on this subject—and it's not available in any bookstore. (If we decide to sell it on Amazon, the price will be nearly 3-times what you'll pay today.)

This book explains in great detail how we got to where we are today. It explains the history of financial Jubilees in America and elsewhere around the world.

And most importantly, it explains everything you need to know and what to do to prepare for the first Jubilee in our country in nearly 50 years.

What will this Jubilee mean

for you and your family?

You see, around the world today, the idea of a Jubilee has become the de facto solution for extreme financial problems... when debts can't be repaid.

Iceland used a Jubilee to restructure mortgages that were underwater. Croatia used a Jubilee in 2015 to wipe out millions in consumer debt. Japan is doing the same right now with nearly half its national debt.

The idea of a debt Jubilee has become the de facto solution when debts can't be paid. President Trump proposed exactly this after Hurricane Maria.

President Trump has suggested a Debt Jubilee for all of Puerto Rico's bond debt after Hurricane Maria.

After studying hundreds of years of financial history, I believe America's upcoming Jubilee will strongly resemble the one that took place in our country way back in 1841...

Back then, the laws were temporarily changed, so debtors could be discharged of their debts... without the consent of the creditors. Over a period of 13 months... more than 40,000 people wiped away their debts before the act was rescinded.

But of course, this time around, the Jubilee won't be tens of thousands of people like it was in 1841... it will instead be tens of millions of people, and trillions of dollars.

Now, if you don't think a debt Jubilee is possible in America, you haven't studied U. S. history... and you aren't paying attention to the current political climate...

Look at the staggering figures behind student loans alone...

Over the past ten years, students (most of whom are young and have virtually no income) have racked up enormous debts, which currently total about $1.5 trillion.

Incredibly, that's what our entire federal government owed a little more than 30 years ago.

And these debts have ballooned to absurd amounts. The number of students with debts over $100,000 has quadrupled in the last ten years. Most of this money will never, ever be repaid.

And most Americans don't realize that the Millennials (who hold nearly 65% of this debt) are now our country's largest generation, outnumbering Baby Boomers.

Just think about the political implications...

These people have an enormous stake in whether or not a national Debt Jubilee is declared.

You see, when the rich—a very small percentage of the population—get in trouble with debt, it's an economic problem.

But when the poor and middle class—a huge percentage of the population—get in trouble with debt, it's a political problem.

And there will be major consequences...

Millions of investors, pensioners, insurance customers, and creditors will lose a fortune.

Stocks will collapse. Dozens of companies will go bankrupt.

Just one quick example of how this problem will affect EVERYONE in America...

Do you remember during the last crisis... the mortgage crisis... how many lenders never bothered to verify the income of people they were lending money to?

Some referred to these as ""Liar Loans,"" which allowed borrowers to make up whatever income figure they wanted... and get a much more expensive house than they could realistically afford.

Well... believe it or not, the same thing is happening again right now with auto loans.

One company I've written about more than a dozen times has made an extraordinary number of these ""Liar Loans"" for cars. And a recent Bloomberg story says this firm verified the income on only 8% of the loans they made!

Just like the mortgage crisis of 2008, these loans have been packaged up into what are known as ""Asset Backed Securities,"" and sold to hundreds of mutual funds, insurance companies, investment firms, even state pension plans.

The financial lawyer on my research team found more than 120 entities that own these dangerous ""Asset Backed Securities.""

When the Debt Jubilee arrives, the problems with all this bad consumer debt will hit at once.

Everyone will freak out.

And that's the biggest problem—the uncertainty.

No one will know for months how it will all get sorted out. So the markets will react violently.

In The American Jubilee, I'll show you the various ways it could play out.

One proposed scenario comes from Rob Johnson, a former banker, who now runs the Institute of New Economic Thinking. He says:

""You call a month-long bank holiday for the twenty largest banks, and that holds everything in place while the regulators mark down the assets and see how everybody's losses will affect everyone else.

""Then you wipe out stockholders, wipe out management, possibly some of the unsecured debt... Once everybody has taken their hit and you've wiped out existing stockholders, then the government comes in and properly, transparently recapitalizes all of them. As these new institutions gain a footing, eventually they can be sold back to the private market.""

No one can know exactly how it will be done, but through one mechanism or another, the government will seek to reset the financial system... and they will start by wiping out trillions of dollars in bad debt.

Car companies, homebuilders, credit card companies, insurance firms, banks, other lending institutions, and any business operating with leverage, will take a huge hit.

Stocks will fall considerably. Banks will close. There will be trillions in losses.

In fact, at the end of the day, I believe the losses at an institution like Wells Fargo could be enough to start a bank run.

And this brings me to...

What can you do to prepare?

In The American Jubilee, you'll learn everything you need to know to prepare for this tumultuous time...

First, we'll provide the ultimate guide to understanding EVERYTHING YOU DO NOT want to own as America's Jubilee unfolds.

This is important, because there will be huge losses.

A Harvard study showed that during a Debt Jubilee in the 1930s, the U. S. government's radical changes in the financial system took more than $700 million in a single year from one segment of the population. Another change caused millions of Americans to lose 69% of their savings, practically overnight.

In The American Jubilee, you'll learn not only what happened in the 1930s... but also what happened during two of America's other Jubilees, in the 1840s and 1960s. And you'll learn how other countries have implemented Jubilees of their own...

In 2015, for example, the Croatian government used a Jubilee to erase more than $20 million in debts for 60,000 people. This was money owed to banks, telecom operators, municipal authorities, and utility companies.

Not a single person or investor was refunded for their losses.

And it's probably no surprise that the stock market went down significantly over the next year.

Keep in mind, the money that I predict will be written off in America's upcoming Jubilee will likely be 100,000-times higher than what we saw in Croatia (around $2 trillion compared to $20 million).

I have an in-house research team of two accountants, a financial lawyer, and a half-dozen analysts. And we've done more work on this subject than anyone else. We've studied thousands of companies. We've looked at 40,000 corporate bond offerings. And in The American Jubilee...

We'll show you the 50 most dangerous companies in America today. There's a good chance you own one of these firms. (page 44)

We'll show you which investment sectors to avoid. (page 43)

We'll show you a critical move you absolutely must make in your bank account. (page 47)

We'll show you what you absolutely must do with your retirement account (like a 401(k)). (page 53)

If you do nothing else, please heed these warnings.

There's an entire section in this book called: The Safety Fund.

As the next Debt Jubilee unfolds, I want to make sure you know about the small group of stocks you can safely hold, with as much of your investment portfolio as you want.*

*The examples provided may not be representative of typical results. Your capital is at risk when you invest in securities—you can lose some or all of your money. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

You see, during the market crash of 2008, a small handful of stocks did not fall at all—they actually went up.*

*The examples provided may not be representative of typical results. Your capital is at risk when you invest in securities—you can lose some or all of your money. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

These companies we profile are the most financially stable companies in the world, and they also produce extraordinary returns. One has gained about 200% over the last five years. Another has gained 600% over the same period.*

*The examples provided may not be representative of typical results. Your capital is at risk when you invest in securities—you can lose some or all of your money. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

The full list and everything you need to know all starts on page 57 of our new book: The American Jubilee.

There's so much more you'll learn too including...

How financial Jubilees unfolded in America during the 1930s and the 1970s. What laws were passed... how it affected regular folks like you and me, and how some assets soared thousands of percent during these periods. (page 7)

The four warning signs to watch for to know when the next Jubilee announcement is imminent. (page 1)

The one financial asset you must have to survive the next crisis. There's no telling how bad social unrest may be. This strategy was taught to me by one of the richest and most successful men I know when we were in the middle of a crisis in South America. This secret costs you almost nothing but could save your life. (page 82)

The incredible way the U.S. government took nearly 69% of Americans' hard-earned savings, practically overnight, during a previous Jubilee. (page 7)

A unique way of owning U.S. currency that will soar in a crisis. This is a clever way of holding real U.S. money. But you can't get this money from your bank. In 2009, during the last big crisis, it went up 50% in a single year... and could easily soar 500% during the next financial crisis.* (page 105)

*The examples provided may not be representative of typical results. Your capital is at risk when you invest in securities—you can lose some or all of your money. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

Why the debts Americans owe today on college, autos, and credit cards are actually much more dangerous than the money owed during the mortgage crisis of 2008. (page 27)

And much, much more... including how one neighborhood survived extreme conditions after hurricane Katrina (page 85)... how to buy the world's ""Trophy Assets"" when they are selling at fire sale prices (page 130)... and a secret way to get some of your money out of the U.S. financial system, without having to open an offshore checking account or anything like that (page 88).

And here's the best part: You’ll pay just $19 for an advance hardback copy of my new 266-page book. I'll even cover the shipping costs. (You can get your copy by  clicking here.)

Plus, in addition to our new book, I want to send you a special series of Research Reports, at no additional charge.

You see, every market-rattling event such as this creates not only losses, but big winners too.

In the American Jubilee of the 1970s, for example, gold went up over 1,400%. Silver went up over 2,000% in just a few years. And another investment I'm going to tell you how to own in a minute, went up more than 1,800%.*

*The examples provided may not be representative of typical results. Your capital is at risk when you invest in securities—you can lose some or all of your money. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

So the next few things I'm going to show you how to do are different... and controversial. I say that because these moves should make you vast amounts of money.

But I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

I don't want you to be happy that other people are going to get hurt.

But these market moves are going to happen, no matter what. There's nothing you or I can do to stop it. All you can do is prepare.

That's why I've outlined a series of simple steps in these reports, to help you safely protect what you've got... and actually make a lot of money over the next few years:

This is a clever investment first created by my friend, the legendary natural resources investor, T. Boone Pickens. It has a history of going up as much as 500% or more just a few years, and you'll learn everything you need to know about it in this free bonus special report.

There's a huge opportunity to make a fortune thanks to major currency fluctuations on the horizon, and you'll learn about an asset that has soared more than 1,000% over a number of years. I think you could conservatively make 500% on this in the next few years*. Again this free report details exactly how to execute this trade.

*The examples provided may not be representative of typical results. Your capital is at risk when you invest in securities—you can lose some or all of your money. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

This trade is already up more than 50% since last fall. It has much, much further to go. You want to get in now.

When there's a big shakeup in the financial markets, the price of silver goes wild. During America's last Jubilee, in the early 1970s, the price of silver went up 2,400%.

You could buy silver bullion... silver mining stocks... or a silver royalty stock. But I want to show you something different. You could realistically make gains of 10,000% or more over a period of several years*.

*The examples provided may not be representative of typical results. Your capital is at risk when you invest in securities—you can lose some or all of your money. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

But you must keep in mind: This silver secret is a pure and absolute speculation. Every step is outlined in this special report, that comes to you free of charge when you purchase a copy of my new book.

Now look... what I've described to you here—a national Jubilee that could wipe out trillions in debt from irresponsible borrowers, while robbing millions of Americans of their legitimate savings—is EXTREMELY controversial.

I know there's sure to be a legion of ""experts"" who will be trotted out on MSNBC and CNN to discredit me and my firm.

They will say the most outrageous things about me.

But I'm not afraid to take on the establishment. I've done it many times before...

No one believed me back in 2006, when I said the two biggest mortgage companies in America (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) would go bankrupt. But I was featured in Barron's when it was clear my prediction was coming true.

People thought I was crazy when I made similar predictions about General Motors. But again, that's exactly what happened.

Few believed me when I said America's biggest mall owner, (General Growth Properties) would collapse. But then it did.

And even fewer people believed me when I said oil prices would drop from well over $100 a barrel to less than $40. But again, that's exactly what happened.

Just as these events were inevitable, so is America's next Jubilee.

Huge losses coming. Economists know it. Most of the senior leaders in Washington know it too.

But what can our leaders do?

The crowds are only going to get angrier and more violent.

A Jubilee that wipes out the debts of millions of the working poor and resets the financial system, is the only answer.

Get the facts for yourself. Learn what you can do now.

Today, a hardback copy of The American Jubilee, costs just $19. And like I said, I'll cover the costs of shipping.

And remember: This book is NOT available anywhere else. If and when it ultimately goes on sale on Amazon, the price will be $49.

1424,2,,"The growing saga over text messages sent between two FBI colleagues who briefly worked on special counsel Robert Mueller’s team took some unexpected turns Thursday, as a cache of missing messages characterized by President Donald Trump as a major scandal had been recovered and as a top Republican backed off a claim that FBI agents formed a “secret society” to undermine Trump.

Earlier this week, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and other Republicans suggested that a months-old text message between the two FBI officials revealed that ""secret society,” and Johnson said a “whistleblower” had corroborated the allegation.

But Johnson refused to publicly release the full text message, sent the day after Trump was elected in November 2016, or to characterize the “whistleblower” in any way.

On Wednesday, ABC News and other news outlets obtained copies of the relevant text message, which indicated the reference to a “secret society” may have been an inside joke.

""Are you even going to give out your calendars? Seems kind of depressing. Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society,"" FBI lawyer Lisa Page wrote to senior FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was working on the FBI’s probe of Russian meddling in the presidential election and would later join Page for a brief period on Mueller’s team.

Thursday, in the wake of news reports quoting the fuller text message, Johnson told reporters “it’s a real possibility” that Strzok and Page cited a “secret society” in jest, and he said he’s now considering releasing more messages sent between the pair.

In addition, the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, Thursday called on Johnson to provide more information about the “whistleblower.”

“The FBI and the people that work there put their lives on the line every day defending our country from a huge array of threats,” McCaskill said in a statement. “We deserve to see all the evidence that Chairman Johnson has in order to understand these incredibly serious allegations.”

The “secret society” text is among a large cache of messages handed over to House and Senate committees in the past two months. After recent news accounts reported that Strzok was axed from Mueller's team for sending potentially anti-Trump messages, lawmakers demanded to see the messages for themselves.

Last Friday, the Justice Department handed Johnson’s committee and other committees batch of more than 1,000 messages sent between Strzok and Page. The department had already provided lawmakers with 375 other messages, including ones in which Strzok repeatedly called Trump an “idiot.”

But that Friday the Justice Department also noted that five months’ worth of messages had gone missing from the FBI and weren’t recovered. Trump and his Republican allies called foul.

“In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “Wow.”

The Justice Department said the messages disappeared due to a ""technical"" glitch and ""misconfiguration issues"" after the FBI tried to upgrade devices used by its agents in the field.

And Thursday, the Justice Department’s inspector general, which first discovered the Strzok-Page messages as part of a broader probe, said it had some – if not all – of the missing messages.

“The [inspector general’s office] has been investigating this matter and, this week, succeeded in using forensic tools to recover text messages from FBI devices, including text messages between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page that were sent or received between December 14, 2016, and May 17, 2017,” the inspector general wrote in a letter to Congress today. “Our effort to recover any additional text messages is ongoing.”

Republican lawmakers have pounced on Strzok and Page’s messages as evidence that the FBI and special counsel probes – with Strzok's involvement – were propelled by political bias.

But in a May 2017 text message from Strzok released by Johnson Monday, Strzok expressed reticence to join Mueller's team, saying he believed ""there's no big there there.""

And Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has dismissed such suggestions, insisting there is nobody ""better qualified for this job"" than Mueller and noting ""political affiliation"" is not the same as political ""bias.""

""We recognize we have employees with political opinions. It's our responsibility to make sure those opinions do not influence their actions,"" Rosenstein recently told a House panel.

1427,3,1.0,"The copycat recipes you really love probably came from here.

Even though this stuff looks like mayonnaise, Food and Drug Administration dudes say it has to be called ""dressing."" Miracle Whip was invented in 1933 as a sweeter, more flavorful alternative to mayonnaise, but it contains a few extra ingredients that the FDA says aren't supposed to be in mayonnaise, such as sugar, paprika, and garlic powder. If you're a fan of Kraft's variation on the creamy white mother sauce, you must try this clone. As with homemade mayonnaise, you make a simple emulsion with egg yolk and oil. Add in the other ingredients and you've got yourself a Miracle Whip kitchen copy that's way fresher than any bottle on store shelves.

This recipe is available in

1. Whisk the egg yolk by hand for 15 seconds.

2. Combine the vinegar, sugar, salt, and lemon juice in a small bowl or  glass measuring cup. Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved. Add half of this solution to the egg yolk and whisk for another 15 seconds.

3. Pour the canola oil into a plastic squirt bottle or measuring cup with a spout. This will allow you to drizzle the oil into the egg yolk with one hand while whisking with the other. Dribble a few drops of oil into the yolk and whisk, and continue to add oil a little bit at a time while whisking non-stop. When you are about halfway through the oil, your mayonnaise should be very thick. Whisk in the remaining vinegar solution and add the  mustard,  paprika, and garlic powder. Now you can add the remaining oil in a steady stream while whisking until all of the oil has been added.

4. Put the dressing into an old mayonnaise jar and seal it with a lid. Keep up to 7 to 10 days in your refrigerator.

Makes 1 cup.

Tidbits: If you are concerned about the raw egg yolk used in this recipe (even though the risk of salmonella poisoning from well-chilled fresh eggs is extremely low), you can buy eggs that have been heat-treated (pasteurized) for a bit more scratch. The vinegar used in the recipe also helps to kill any stray bacteria baddies.

Recipe ingredients are great combo. Instead of all the steps though I just put everything in my miracle whip jar I use and my stick blender and it comes out perfect. Then chill. Great recipe. Thank you. I didn't think it was possible but I like it even more than the store bought miracle whip.

Great Copycat Recipe!  I forgot to buy some Miracle Whip for my husband's apple salad and decided to find a homemade solution.  I first tried the recipe to convert mayo, but it still tasted too much like mayonnaise.  Then I tried this one and it is perfect!  I used an immersion blender and followed directions.  It came out perfectly!

Global megastar Dwayne Johnson headlines the action adventure “Rampage,” directed by Brad Peyton.     Primatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth.  But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.     “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”), Jason Liles (“Death Note”), Demetrius Grosse (TV’s “The Brave”), Will Yun Lee (TV’s “Hawaii Five-O”).

Peyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage.

“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing.

The creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”

The “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).

“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.

A New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.

1436,3,1.0,"PORTO ALEGRE - A presidente do PT, senadora Gleisi Hoffmann, discursava aos apoiadores de Lula na região próxima à sede do Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região (TRF-4) no momento em que relator do caso, desembargador João Pedro Gebran, concluiu o seu voto a favor do aumento da pena do ex-presidente para 12 anos e um mês. Gleisi afirmou que o voto já era esperado e que agora é hora de “radicalizar”.

— Vamos radicalizar. Não vamos sair das ruas — afirmou Gleisi.

PERGUNTAS E RESPOSTAS: Lula pode ser candidato se for condenado?

LEIA MAIS: Bar oferece 1% de desconto para cada ano de pena de Lula

Na hora em que foi feito o anúncio, parte dos presentes gritou palavras de ordem a favor de Lula.

A presidente do PT acrescentou que Gebran seguiu o roteiro que os petistas já esperavam: “sem surpresas”. Acrescentou que o relator “gastou mais de 200 páginas do seu voto para defender a sentença do (juiz Sergio) Moro”.

Apesar de ter falado como se o julgamento já estivesse decidido, Gleisi disse acreditar que os outros dois desembargadores, Leandro Paulsen e Victor Laus, seguirão caminho diferente do de Gebran por serem “mais técnicos”.

— Espero que os votos deles sejam pela Justiça e não pela política.

Após discursar, Gleisi embarcou para São Paulo, onde vai se encontra com Lula em ato programado para acontecer na Avenida Paulista, no começo da noite. Em São Bernardo do Campo (SP), o ex-presidente já discursou nesta quarta-feira e disse estar extremamente tranquilo com o julgamento.

Nesta quarta-feira, o vice-presidente do Senado, Cássio Cunha Lima (PSDB-PB), cobrou providências das instâncias jurídicas contra Gleisi Hoffman, pelo que chamou de “incitação a violência” da população, por não aceitar a confirmação da condenação do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Cássio disse que, sem conseguir defender Lula, a presidente do PT assumiu comportamento ""incendiário"" intolerável.

INFOGRÁFICO: Os argumentos da defesa de Lula

— O livre funcionamento da Justiça é algo essencial a democracia. A condenação ou a absolvição de um réu é algo natural. O que não ser tolerado é a incitação á violência pelo PT, que não conseguindo se defender das graves acusações, não bastasse quebrar o Brasil, quer agora incendiar o país — criticou o senador.

Na semana passada, a presidente do PT causou polêmica ao dizer que para Lula ser preso “vai ter que prender muita gente, mais do que isso, vai ter que matar gente”.

'É A VINGAÇANUA E CRUA', DIZ LINDBERGH FARIAS

Em seu perfil no Twitter, o deputado federal Lindbergh Farias (PT-RJ) afirmou que “Gebran conclui seu voto ampliando a pena de Lula para 12 anos em regime fechado e pagamento de multa de 1 milhão. É a vingança nua e crua: tudo se justifica pelo desejo de desmoralizar a esquerda e destruir seus símbolos”.

Segundo o deputado, o “grande trabalho do relator Gebran foi compilar delações para vomitá-las arbitrariamente em rede nacional. Não existem provas; o que sobra é a convicção formada ao longo dos anos de convívio nos salões das elite”. Lindbergh Farias disse ainda que a frase “Lula traiu a esperança do povo brasileiro” é o requinte de cinismo de um relatório infame.

“É inacreditável que o relator do processo do Lula no TRF4 seja exatamente o cidadão que figura nos agradecimentos especiais da dissertação do juiz de Curitiba”, concluiu Lindbergh Farias.

1439,1,,"In an exclusive interview with teleSUR, Brazilian professor and researcher Sabrina Fernandes discusses former President Luiz Inacio “Lula” da Silva's Jan. 24 corruption trial and forthcoming elections in the South American country.

What has been the response of the non-Workers’ Party, PT, left to the current situation and in the lead up to the presidential election?

The non-PT left is divided between the organizations in the left that were part of the PT governments and its base, and the left that has stood in a critical stance of the governments, pushing for a more radical agenda.

The first is standing together with Lula throughout the sentencing and appeal process and part of it supports him as their preferential candidate, with the notable exception of Manuela D'Avila, from the Communist Party of Brazil, PCdoB. The opposition left, which I call the radical left, is a very fragmented one, so its own positions are also fragmented.

Most of the Socialism and Liberty Party, PSOL, internal organizations are standing in solidarity with Lula for his right to be a candidate, which depends on a successful appeal, although the PSOL will have its own presidential candidate. Other parties such as the Unified Socialist Workers' Party, PSTU, and the Brazilian Communist Party, PCB, have kept a wider distance from the troubles afflicting the PT, and it's noteworthy that the PSTU promoted a ""Out with all of them!"" campaign during the former President Dilma Rousseff impeachment crisis and they are urging the working class to organize against President Michel Temer's reforms, rather than focusing on the trial.

Lula has been working his way through the country on his caravan. Do you think this has had impact? If so, what?

In some ways, yes.

Lula is a very well liked public personality in many parts of the country, despite the years of character assassination promoted by the mainstream media. Even leftist critics who have stood in fierce opposition to his policies tend to acknowledge him as a savvy politician and widely popular former president.

The caravan helped to remind some of the former Lula base that he is still a powerful contender and kept his name in the headlines through positive media frames in contrast to the investigation and trial reports. In the event that Lula is cleared and becomes, officially, a presidential candidate, the caravan will have served the purpose of paving the way for a campaign.

However, in terms of the trial, I don't believe it was that paramount to build a supporter base to stand with him in Porto Alegre. Most of the protesters joining him in solidarity against the charges are connected to the organized left, especially sectors that have supported Lula from the beginning.

In the event of Lula not being able to run in 2018, what does the race look like?

The race will be very polarized between the left and the right, but it will face a far more fragmented electoral left than in the past 30 years because there is no other name in the left with the stature of Lula's name.

A conviction may also act in detriment of the PT candidate that replaces him, as well as explicit endorsement by the former president. There is much speculation about who the PT would promote instead, but no obvious name given that their sole efforts have been on guaranteeing Lula's appeal so that he can be the candidate.

It's important to say that the electoral right is also very fragmented in 2018, with direct disputes inside of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, PSDB, the PT's traditional right-wing opponent in the federal elections, and names like Jair Bolsonaro push the spectrum to the extreme right. While Bolsonaro presents a definite setback, the fragmentation inside the right ensures that his support is limited, especially since he is controversial and hasn't managed to gather enough support from the markets and main representatives from the elites in Brazil, who we know influence the media and the electability of a candidate.

Does the PT have a contingency? Is there a plan B for pro-Lula/PT social movements like some of the unions and the Landless Workers’ Movement, MST?

If Lula is convicted, he can still be the PT's presidential candidate up to the point where the Superior Electoral Court also finds him guilty through the Ficha Limpa law and prevents him from running.

It's my guess that the party will keep Lula on the race as long as possible and that, once the Ficha Limpa process is concluded, they will replace him with a different candidate. This will allow the PT to try to build support for Lula as an endorser and to keep the party in the headlines.

It will be the task of the PT and the organizations that support it to take this time to find a new candidate and build their name as well. At the same time, with a conviction that results from such a flawed process — from the investigations to Moro's sentencing — Lula may become a bit of a martyr, representing the elites' prosecutorial approach to the left in general and the interests of the people.

Even if the PT government's are seen as not having applied a sufficient amount of meaningful reforms, there is little doubt that the reforms since Temer became president have been devastating and despite this, from the outside, it appears as though the right-wing is strengthened. Is this the case from your perspective? What is the best outcome of the election for the left and popular sectors?

What is worrisome is that positive electoral results for the left in 2018 do not necessarily guarantee that the Temer's reforms will be done away with. Lula himself made some controversial remarks last year about having keep some of the reforms, while the PT's national president recently stated that Lula ought to prepare another version of is 2002 letter to the markets in order to appease them.

This is a trend for most of the candidates in the the center-left and all of the candidates in right, which has put the radical left is the position of being as intransigent as possible when it comes to repealing the reforms and promoting progressive ones instead. The radical left is still very small in comparison, though, and, as of now, it doesn't hold the ingredients for a Bernie Sanders phenomenon that could tip the electoral scales in favour of the left in 2018.

A lot of the worries in the left, in general, is that the right may return officially to power in 2019, which would prove even more disastrous than the Temer illegitimate mandate. What we must hope for is that the left manages to present itself in all of its diversity in a way that sounds like the real alternative for those suffering from the economic crisis and the deep inequalities that plague Brazil.

Even if there are multiple candidates in the left rather than consensus around one name and one project, the best outcome would be one that gets the popular sectors to the streets again around real change, pushing for a more radical leftist agenda and for parties to show strength and courage to implement what the PT governments failed to do. Ideally, that would result in a leftist elected president and a more progressive National Congress, considering that much of what has happened so far against working class interests is due to the power of a right-wing Congress in Brazil.

1441,1,,"O Estado de Direito e a independência do Judiciário são conquistas frágeis em muitos países, além de suscetíveis a reversões repentinas.

O Brasil, o último país no Ocidente a abolir a escravidão, é uma democracia relativamente jovem, tendo saído da ditadura há apenas três décadas. Nos últimos dois anos, o que poderia ter sido um avanço histórico (o governo do Partido dos Trabalhadores conceder autonomia ao Judiciário para investigar e processar a corrupção oficial) se transformou no oposto. Como resultado, a democracia do Brasil agora está mais fraca do que desde o fim do governo militar.

Nesta semana, essa democracia pode sofrer uma erosão ainda maior quando os três desembargadores de segunda instância decidirem se a figura política mais popular do país, o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, do Partido dos Trabalhadores, será impedido de disputar a eleição presidencial de 2018 ou até mesmo se será preso.

Não há muito fingimento de que o tribunal será imparcial. O presidente do tribunal já elogiou a decisão do juiz de primeira instância de condenar Lula por corrupção como ""tecnicamente irrepreensível"" e sua chefe de gabinete postou em sua página no Facebook um abaixo-assinado pedindo a prisão de Lula.

O juiz da primeira instância, Sérgio Moro, já demonstrou seu próprio partidarismo em várias ocasiões. Ele teve que pedir desculpas ao Supremo Tribunal Federal em 2016 pela divulgação das conversas grampeadas entre Lula e a presidente Dilma Rousseff, o advogado dele, sua esposa e filhos. O juiz Moro promoveu um espetáculo para a imprensa no qual a polícia compareceu à casa de Lula e o levou para interrogatório, apesar de Lula ter dito que se apresentaria voluntariamente.

As evidências contra Lula estão bem abaixo dos padrões que seriam levados a sério, por exemplo, na Justiça dos Estados Unidos.

Ele é acusado de ter aceito propina de uma grande construtora, chamada OAS, que foi processada no esquema de corrupção chamado de ""Lava Jato"" no Brasil. Esse escândalo multibilionário envolveu empresas pagando propinas elevadas para as autoridades ligadas à empresa estatal de petróleo Petrobras visando a obtenção de contratos a preços altamente superfaturados.

A propina supostamente recebida por Lula é um apartamento de propriedade da OAS. Mas não há evidência documental de que Lula ou sua mulher tenham recebido a escritura, tenha alugado ou até mesmo ficado no apartamento, nem que tenha tentado aceitar o presente.

A evidência contra Lula se baseia no depoimento de um executivo condenado da OAS, José Aldemário Pinheiro Filho, que teve sua pena de prisão reduzida em troca da entrega de evidência. Segundo reportagem do proeminente jornal brasileiro ""Folha de S. Paulo"", Pinheiro teve sua delação anulada quando originalmente contou a mesma história que Lula sobre o apartamento. Ele também passou seis meses em detenção pré-julgamento. (Essa evidência é discutida no documento de sentença de 238 páginas.)

Mas essa parca evidência não foi suficiente para o juiz Moro. No que os americanos poderiam considerar um tribunal de faz-de-conta, ele sentenciou Lula a nove anos e meio de prisão.

O Estado de Direito democrático do Brasil já tinha sofrido um golpe devastador em 2016, quando a sucessora de Lula, Dilma Rousseff, que foi eleita em 2010 e reeleita em 2014, sofreu impeachment e foi removida do cargo. Grande parte do mundo (e possivelmente do Brasil) pode acreditar que ela foi afastada por corrupção. Na verdade, ela foi acusada por uma manobra contábil que fez o déficit federal temporariamente parecer menor do que era de fato. Foi algo que outros presidentes e governadores já fizeram sem consequências. E o próprio procurador-geral do governo concluiu que não tinha sido um crime.

Apesar do envolvimento em corrupção de políticos de partidos de todo o espectro político, incluindo do Partido dos Trabalhadores, não houve acusações de corrupção contra Rousseff no processo de impeachment.

Lula permanece em primeiro lugar nas pesquisas de intenção de voto da eleição de outubro por causa do sucesso dele e do partido na reversão de um longo declínio econômico. De 1980 a 2003, o crescimento da economia brasileira foi mínimo, de cerca de 0,2% por ano per capita. Lula assumiu em 2003 e Rousseff em 2011. O salário mínimo cresceu 76%, os salários reais em geral subiram 35%, o desemprego atingiu baixas recordes e a infame desigualdade do Brasil finalmente diminuiu.

Mas em 2014, uma profunda recessão teve início e a direita brasileira tirou proveito da situação para promover o que muitos brasileiros consideram um golpe parlamentar.

Se Lula for impedido de disputar a eleição presidencial, o resultado poderia ter pouca legitimidade, assim como a eleição hondurenha em novembro foi amplamente vista como roubada. Uma pesquisa realizada no ano passado apontou que 42,7% dos brasileiros acredita que Lula está sendo processado pela mídia de notícias e pelo Judiciário. Uma eleição sem credibilidade poderia ser politicamente desestabilizadora.

Talvez mais importante, o Brasil se reconstituirá como uma forma muito mais limitada de democracia eleitoral, na qual um Judiciário politizado pode excluir um líder político popular da disputa de um cargo. Isso seria uma calamidade para os brasileiros, para a região e para o mundo.

1448,1,,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Of the 30 U. S. children who have died from the flu so far this season, some 85 percent likely will not have been vaccinated, said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, who urged Americans to get flu shots amid one of the most severe flu seasons in years.

“My message is, if you haven’t gotten a vaccine, please get a vaccine. Also, please get your children vaccinated,” said Fitzgerald, who is urging citizens “to take every advantage that you can to protect yourself.”

The dominant strain during this flu season is an especially nasty type called influenza A (H3N2) that in seasons past has been linked with severe disease and death, especially in the elderly and young. This year’s seasonal flu epidemic is especially severe.

In past flu seasons, between 80 and 85 percent of children who have died from the flu had not gotten a flu vaccine that season, the agency said in an email.

In its latest report, the CDC said the virus is present in every state, with 32 states reporting severe flu activity.

Although the vaccine is only estimated to be about 30 percent effective against the H3N2 strain, it has been shown in studies to reduce severity and duration if people do become infected, said Dr. Dan Jernigan, director of the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Fitzgerald conceded in a telephone interview that reports that the flu vaccine in Australia was only 10 percent effective may have caused people to think the vaccine would not be worth the trouble.

Fitzgerald said the agency’s flu division has been on the job during the three-day federal government shutdown. Senators on Monday reached a deal to keep the government funded through Feb. 8.

Studies have shown that even a vaccine that has lower overall effectiveness can decrease the number of days spent in hospital, duration of the flu and the degree of symptoms.

“That helps support the point of getting a vaccine,” Jernigan said.

Fitzgerald said the flu vaccine and antiviral drugs used to fight the flu are widely available across the country, noting that people can go to the CDC website and enter their zip code to find the nearest flu clinics with vaccines. (here)

Fitzgerald also recommended that people frequently wash their hands or use hand sanitizer, avoid those who are sick or coughing and carry disinfectant wipes.

The CDC does not have numbers for adult deaths from the flu because adult flu is not a reportable disease in all U. S.  states. But she said North Carolina, which collects such data, has reported 42 adult flu deaths so far this season.

Official estimates from the CDC are expected at the end of the current season, based on a calculation from hospitals and states reporting data to the agency.

In the 2014/2015 flu season, in which the H3N2 strain was also the leading strain, there were an estimated 35.6 million cases, 710,000 hospitalizations and 56,000 deaths. At this point, it is not clear whether the current flu season will surpass those estimates, Jernigan said.

1449,1,,"There will be a showdown with Satan on Tuesday in the Missouri Supreme Court.

Not with Lucifer himself, but with a group called the Satanic Temple that is going to bat for a woman identified as ""Mary Doe."" She contends the state’s informed consent law, which required her to wait 72 hours before having an abortion in May 2015, violated her religious beliefs.

Specifically, the woman — identified in the case summary as a ""Greene County resident"" — says she was forced to view an ultrasound of her fetus and pledge that she read a booklet stating that the “life of every human being begins at conception.”

This despite the fact that Doe advised the doctors at the St. Louis clinic that ""she adheres to principles of the Satanic temple and has sincerely held religious beliefs different from the information in the informed consent booklet,"" the case summary states.

""Specifically, her letter advised she has deeply held religious beliefs that a nonviable fetus is not a separate human being but is part of her body and that abortion of a nonviable fetus does not terminate the life of a separate, unique, living human being.""

Jex Blackmore, a spokeswoman for the Satanic Temple, said the woman's religious rights were ignored.

“The State has essentially established a religious indoctrination program intended to push a single ideological viewpoint,” Blackmore said in a statement. “The law is intended to punish women who disagree with this opinion.”

The state will be represented by lawyers from the office of Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is one of the defendants named in Doe’s lawsuit along with Gov. Eric Greitens, who is currently embroiled in a steamy sex scandal.

While Hawley’s office did not release any new statement in advance of Tuesday’s hearing, it is expected to argue, as it did last year, that Doe “failed to allege any conflict between her putative Satanic beliefs and the operation of the Informed Consent Law.”

The Satanic Temple filed state and federal lawsuits on behalf of Doe in May 2015.

“Missouri’s state-mandated informed consent booklets explicitly say that life begins at conception, which is a nonmedical religious viewpoint that many people disagree with,” Blackmore said in a statement Monday. “Forcing women to read this information and then wait 72-hours to consider the State’s opinion is a clear violation of the Establishment Clause.”

“Even if Doe has alleged a restriction on free exercise (of religion), the Informed Consent Law clearly serves compelling state interests and is not unduly restrictive on Doe’s asserted exercise of religion,” the state argued in court papers on Sept. 21.

That argument, however, failed to persuade a Missouri appeals court, which agreed in October to kick the case up to the state’s top court — a case the panel called the first of its kind.

""Neither the Missouri Supreme Court nor the U. S. Supreme Court has considered whether a Booklet of this nature, an Ultrasound, an Audible Heartbeat Offer, and a seventy-two-hour Waiting Period violate the Religion Clause rights of pregnant women,"" Judge Thomas Newton wrote for the majority. ""Because we believe that this case raises real and substantial constitutional claims, it is within the Missouri Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction.”

The Satanic Temple describes itself as “a nontheistic religious organization dedicated to Satanic practice and the promotion of Satanic rights.”

“The Temple understands the Satanic figure as a symbol of man’s inherent nature, representative of the eternal rebel, enlightened inquiry and personal freedom rather than a supernatural deity of being,” it said in a statement.

In a July 2015 interview with The New York Times, one of the co-founders — who used the pseudonym Malcolm Jarry in the story — said he doesn’t really believe in the Devil but believes in strict separation of church and state. His group also opposes tax exemptions for religious organizations.

The Satanic Temple waded into the culture wars in 2013 by working to sabotage Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s push for voluntary prayer at public school functions by standing on the steps of the state Capitol with a banner declaring, “Hail Satan! Hail Rick Scott!”

Then in 2015, the Satanic Temple inserted itself into the battle over the Ten Commandments monument at the Oklahoma State House by insisting that they be allowed to place a statue of the goat-headed deity Baphomet near the Christian statue.

""We believe that all monuments should be in good taste and consistent with community standards,"" Temple spokesman Lucien Greaves (also a pseudonym) wrote in letter to the state's Capitol Preservation Commission. ""Our proposed monument, as an homage to the historic/literary Satan, will certainly abide by these guidelines.""

The Ten Commandments monument was removed after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that placing it on Capitol grounds violated the Constitution.

1450,1,,"A Mississippi legislator, Credell Calhoun, has proposed a bill that would force teachers to recite the Ten Commandments at the beginning of every school day. Because what Mississippi needs in its public schools is more Jesus.

House Bill 1100 would amend existing laws in the following ways:

What used to be an optional moment of silence would be required in every public school.

A copy of the Ten Commandments would also have to be displayed in every classroom (alongside the already-required “In God We Trust” signs).

And then, since his hand was already on the dial, Calhoun turned it up to 11 for the final request:

The school board of each school district shall require the teachers in that school district to have the Ten Commandments recited aloud at the beginning of the first hour of class each day that school is in session. Any student or teacher who objects to reciting the Ten Commandments must be excused from participating without penalty.

What exactly is the educational benefit of telling children they can’t have other gods before the one true Christian God? Or that they can’t make false idols? Or they can’t take God’s name in vain? Or that they have to rest on Sunday? Or that they can’t have sex with people they’re not married to? Or they can’t want what their neighbors have?

Do kindergartners really need to be told not to commit adultery?

And what teachers are clamoring for the government to give them one more useless thing to do at the beginning of the day? Which teachers are lobbying the legislature for the ability to tell children they’ll burn in Hell for all of eternity if they don’t follow a set of mostly arbitrary rules?

This isn’t just a horrible idea; it’s illegal. Giving students and teachers the option of opting out doesn’t change that. Shoving the Ten Commandments down the throats of every public school student in the state is an obvious endorsement of religion in the classroom, and there’s no doubt this would be challenged in the courts if it passed.

For now, the legislation is in the House Committee on Education where it should die a sad, lonely death.

Credell Calhoun, by the way, is a Democrat.

Com esse entendimento, a 1ª Zona Eleitoral de São Paulo condenou seis vezes o Movimento Brasil Livre (MBL) e o vereador paulista Fernando Holiday (DEM) a pagarem R$ 5 mil cada por peças que divulgaram na rede nas eleições de 2016.

Nas representações eleitorais, o candidato a vereador Todd Tomorrow (Psol), por meio do advogado Fernando Gaspar Neisser, alegou que Fernando Holiday divulgou propaganda eleitoral no site do MBL na campanha eleitoral de 2016. E isso, segundo Tomorrow, viola a proibição de veicular publicidade em favor de partidos e candidatos por pessoas jurídicas.

Em sua defesa, Holiday sustentou que já se manifestava na página no Facebook do MBL muito antes de se candidatar. Já esta organização disse que não tem registro de pessoa jurídica nem relação com o Movimento Renovação Liberal (MRL), que detém os domínios virtuais do grupo.

Mas o juiz eleitoral Sidney da Silva Braga destacou que o MBL e o MRL são a mesma pessoa jurídica, sendo aquele mero nome fantasia deste. Tanto que o MBL indica o CNPJ do MRL em seu site, ressaltou. Para Braga, há vínculo de fato e de direito entre as suas entidades, uma regularmente constituída e a outra não.

E a Resolução do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral 23.457/2015 e a Lei 9.504/1997 proíbem a veiculação de propaganda eleitoral em páginas de pessoas jurídicas, com ou sem fins lucrativos. Dessa maneira, o juiz eleitoral condenou Holiday e o MBL, nas seis ações, a pagarem, cada um R$ 30 mil.

1461,1,,"Foram 33 anos de uma escrita precisa, seletiva - em meados dos anos 1980, o escritor Ariano Suassuna (1927-2014) começou a rascunhar o que se tornaria o Romance de Dom Pantero no Palco dos Pecadores, publicado agora pela Nova Fronteira. Trata-se de uma caixa com dois volumes, que trazem uma espécie de testamento literário do autor do Auto da Compadecida. Um trabalho monumental, cuja narrativa inclui elementos com os quais Suassuna mantinha familiaridade: teatro, poesia, prosa e ensaio.

+++'Ariano Suassuna era um grande sedutor, de ideias firmes e engraçado', diz editora

Inicialmente previsto para quatro volumes, o romance terminou com dois (O Jumento Sedutor e O Palhaço Tetrafônico) e oferece uma reavaliação muito particular da própria obra a partir da narrativa de Dom Pantero, cujo nome verdadeiro é Antero Savreda. Escritor frustrado, Pantero (ou Savreda) tem a ambição de conquistar a glória literária a partir da obra bem-sucedida de seus irmãos, muito mais conhecidos: o romancista Auro Shapino, o poeta Altinho Soares e o dramaturgo Adriel Soares. Note-se que todos os nomes dos irmãos começam com as letras A e S, ou seja, despontam como heterônimos mal disfarçados de Ariano Suassuna.

+++ Ariano Suassuna é festejado com inéditos e a peça 'Suassuna - O Auto do Reino do Sol'

“O romance se apresenta como uma autobiografia, mas uma autobiografia deformada - deformadíssima, diríamos melhor - pelo espelho da arte, posto que é ‘Musical, Dançarina, Poética, Teatral e Videocinematográfica’”, observa, em texto introdutório, Carlos Newton Júnior, pesquisador que vem organizando a obra inédita de Suassuna, ao lado do filho do escritor, o artista plástico Manuel Dantas Suassuna, e do designer Ricardo Gouveia de Melo. “Uma autobiografia em que o autor passa em revista toda a sua diversificada obra, cuja autoria é atribuída, por gênero, a seus diversos heterônimos, todos membros da família Savedra.”

Suassuna era um artista fundamentalmente enraizado na cultura brasileira, defendendo-a com clamor, mas também com rigor, separando o joio do trigo. E, sempre em busca da perfeição, não se importava em reescrever parte da própria obra, quando julgava necessário. “Não foram poucas as alterações que empreendeu no plano da obra até chegar a uma forma final que o satisfizesse plenamente”, ainda escreve Newton Júnior. “Perfeccionista declarado, Suassuna burilou o texto o quanto pôde. Impossível quantificar os episódios e cenas cortados e acrescentados, os nomes de personagens alterados, as passagens inteiramente reescritas ou simplesmente descartadas.”

“No Romance, Ariano Suassuna nos permite imergir nos seus continentes imaginais, nas suas angústias, esperanças e alegrias. Instigado pela plenitude da cosmicidade, nos entrega um Sertão mais primordial, mágico, invisível, íntimo, profético, circense, desértico, mortal. Um Sertão que é o Mundo”, comenta, em texto publicado na contracapa de um dos volumes, a pesquisadora Maria Aparecida Lopes Nogueira.

Newton Júnior fala também que os papéis deixados pelo escritor esclarecem em detalhes o seu processo de trabalho. “Os milhares de páginas manuscritas conservadas em seu gabinete de trabalho revelam que bastante coisa ficou de fora da versão final - o que nos leva à inequívoca conclusão de que o romance cresceria muito, caso Ariano não tivesse começado a passar, em 2013, pelos problemas de saúde que o forçaram a colocar um ponto final na obra”, argumenta.

No livro, Pantero ministra o que chama de “aulas espetaculosas”, algo semelhante às deliciosas aulas-espetáculo com as quais Ariano percorreu o País enquanto teve forças, alcançando um enorme sucesso. Enquanto escrevia, Suassuna temia por uma certa rejeição da obra. “É por causa da minha escrita, cheia de rudeza, digressões, venho por aqui, vou por ali”, disse ele ao Estado, em 2011. “Houve um tempo em que as pessoas reclamavam porque eu não escrevia como Graciliano Ramos ou Guimarães Rosa. Tenho minha personalidade, sou incapaz da concisão. Preciso de horizontes mais amplos.”

“Assim Suassuna pensava a sua obra: como um marco do Brasil verdadeiro e profundo, que apontasse para o nosso povo um novo caminho a seguir; mais justo e fraterno, do ponto de vista social, do que o que trilhamos até agora; e mais belo e original do que o caminho da vulgaridade, da descaracterização e do mau gosto, apontado pela massificação cultural e pelos apóstolos da globalização”, afirma Newton Júnior, que participa ainda da equipe que prepara o lançamento em livro de peças inéditas do escritor paraibano.

São, ao menos, cinco textos dramatúrgicos e o mais antigo data de 1950: O Auto de João de Cruz, que adapta tanto o clássico Fausto, de Goethe, como o cordel A História do Estudante Que Vendeu a Alma ao Diabo. A peça promove uma ligação com o Auto da Compadecida, especialmente na cena em que João, ainda vivíssimo, vai ao local onde são julgados os mortos. O texto recebeu apenas uma montagem, amadora, em 1958, no Recife.

Estudei enfermagem há quase 20 anos e na literatura sempre falou que : “a forma grave da febre amarela é raríssima.” Trabalho há 17 anos em dois dos maiores hospitais de Belo Horizonte. Não me lembro, em todos esses anos, de um só paciente internado pela forma grave da doença. Pergunto: que história é essa de “surto” de febre amarela, na forma grave, pelo país??? Porque ninguém fala sobre o que aconteceu para que a forma rara se tornasse tão ‘popular’? Eu faço minhas conclusões: primeiro, não acredito nas estatísticas divulgadas pela mídia.

Segundo, não confio no treinamento e cartilhas dadas as médicos, que lhes confere como fechar o diagnóstico. “A febre amarela é uma doença infecciosa, causada por vírus e transmitida por vetores. Geralmente, quem contrai este vírus não chega a apresentar sintomas ou os mesmos são muito fracos. As primeiras manifestações da doença são repentinas: febre alta, calafrios, cansaço, dor de cabeça, dor muscular, náuseas e vômitos por cerca de três dias. A forma mais grave da doença é rara e costuma aparecer após um breve período de bem-estar (até dois dias), quando podem ocorrer insuficiências hepática e renal, icterícia (olhos e pele amarelados), manifestações hemorrágicas e cansaço intenso.

🔥Esta é uma verdadeira experiência de vida de uma mulher que se queimou ... 🔥.

Algum tempo atrás, eu estava cozinhando milho e derramado água fria na água fervente para ver se o milho estava pronto. Por engano eu mergulhei minha mão na água fervente .... !!

Um amigo meu que era um médico veterinário vietnamita tinha vindo para a casa. Então, como eu uivava de dores, ele me perguntou se eu tinha um saquinho de farinha de trigo em casa.

Eu derramei um pouco e ele colocou minha mão na farinha e me pediu para esperar por cerca de 10 minutos.

Ele me disse que no Vietnã havia um menino que uma vez queimou. Com o fogo sobre ele e em pânico alguém derramou um saco de farinha em todo o corpo para tentar extinguir o fogo. Mas não só o extinguido disparado não havia vestígios de queimaduras no garoto !!!!

No meu caso, coloquei minha mão no saco de farinha por 10 minutos e, em seguida, tirei-a e nem percebi nenhuma marca vermelha de queima depois disso. Além disso, absolutamente nenhuma dor.

Hoje eu coloco um saco de farinha na geladeira e sempre queiro eu uso a farinha. Na verdade, a farinha fria é muito melhor do que a temperatura ambiente.

Eu uso farinha e eu nunca tenho nenhum traço de queimaduras!

Eu mesmo tinha queimado a língua uma vez e coloquei a farinha por cerca de 10 minutos .... A dor parou.

Portanto, sempre tenha pelo menos uma saqueta de farinha na sua geladeira.

SI, ENVIAR

La aclaración de la funcionaria es necesaria, puesto que, una vez se hizo el anuncio, se levantaron diversas voces entre las que se evidenció confusión sobre la implementación de la Ley 1874 del 27 de diciembre del 2017. La idea inicial era separarla de ‘ciencias sociales’, a la que fue integrada tras la firma de la Ley 115 de 1994.

Ramírez explicó que historia no se puede separar de la materia de ciencias sociales; es decir, seguirá estando como lo ha estado desde 1994. Según la funcionaria, lo que busca esta ley es contribuir a la formación de una identidad nacional que reconozca la diversidad étnica cultural de la Nación colombiana; desarrollar el pensamiento crítico a través de la comprensión de los procesos históricos y sociales de nuestro país en el contexto americano y mundial; y promover la formación de una memoria histórica que contribuya a la reconciliación y la paz en nuestro país.

Sin embargo, es importante reconocer que el documento inicial del proyecto de ley que presentó la exsenadora Viviane Morales ante el Congreso proponía que se independizara historia de las ciencias sociales y se dictara como una materia aparte.

“Desde hace 32 años se dejó de enseñar la historia de Colombia como una materia independiente y obligatoria. Da Vinci decía que no se puede amar lo que no se conoce. Nuestra generación de jóvenes conoce muy poco de la historia de nuestro país. Por eso consideré como una tarea indispensable revivir la enseñanza de la historia como materia obligatoria e independiente (de las ciencias sociales)”, expresó Morales una vez Santos sancionó la ley.

Pero el resultado no fue el que ella esperaba: la ley que firmó el Presidente establece que historia seguirá estando entre las ciencias sociales, grupo conformado por geografía y democracia. El artículo 4 dice: “La educación en historia de Colombia como una disciplina integrada en los lineamientos curriculares de las ciencias sociales, sin que se afecte el currículo e intensidad horaria en áreas de matemáticas, ciencia y lenguaje”.

Según Ramírez, cuando se enseña historia se deben tener en cuenta los componentes culturales y , además, uno de los grandes cambios está enfocado hacia el cómo se enseña. “Queremos que a través de esta materia se fortalezca la competencia del pensamiento crítico. Es decir, si queremos ciudadanos críticos que transformen sus contextos no se les puede enseñar solo unos contenidos y unos hechos, es enseñar a pensar”, explicó.

Además, aclaró una de las dudas de los colegios, y es si se tendrá que contratar a docentes especializados en historia, y la respuesta es no. La transformación será en el cómo se enseña.

“Tendremos que llegar con lineamientos para generar pensamiento crítico, también en contenidos de memoria histórica; por ejemplo, cómo abordar la historia del conflicto en regiones que se han visto afectadas por la guerra”, explica la funcionaria.

Para esto, la ley estableció que se deberá crear una comisión de expertos que analicen las necesidades y las caracterísitcas de la enseñanza de la historia de Colombia según su contexto. Según el MEN, esto tomará dos años; al final se sacará un producto, es decir, lineamientos para los docentes y las instituciones educativas.

Mario Fernando Hurtado, experto en educación, ha sido uno de los principales críticos de esta ley. Le dijo a EL TIEMPO: “Fue un desperdicio, y lo único que demuestra es la ignorancia del sector de la educación”. Y explica que la materia de historia nunca salió de los colegios, sino que estaba integrada en ciencias sociales, de ahí que esta ley no cambia nada.

Óscar de Jesús Saldarriaga, historiador experto en la historia de la educación, explicó que no ha habido históricamente un consenso entre el MEN y los docentes en torno a cómo se debe enseñar la historia en los colegios, mientras que ciencias, matemáticas y lenguaje, sí.

Y aseguró que en las ciencias sociales no hay un interés gubernamental, pues no están incluidas en las pruebas internacionales.

Otros expertos se han pronunciado en columnas de opinión y cartas, en las cuales aseguran que aunque es importante que se preste atención a la historia, también es de cuidado, pues puede servir para intereses políticos.

WhatsApp is causing a serious fake news problem in BrazilWhatsApp is causing a serious fake news problem in BrazilIn mid-October 2017, an article on the site “Book of Truth” (Livro da Verdade in Portuguese) spread like wildfire on Brazil’s most popular social media services.  Vaguely resembling a piece of tabloid copy, the story claimed popular Brazilian drag queen Pabllo Vittar was getting public funding to host a kids TV show on Globo, the Brazilian TV network.

Ortellado says they’re primarily able to get information by lurking in large WhatsApp political groups or examining context clues, giving analysts “certainly a tiny fraction of what's going on."" “This was a fake story that did extremely well on Facebook, but on the website there wasn't a share button for Facebook, just WhatsApp,” Ortellado said.  The creation and spread of fake news has alarmed governments the world over, but few countries have expressed as much concern as Brazil. And with good reason, as multiple reports have concluded that fake news stories regularly outperformed real stories in Brazil in 2016. The problem has grown so rampant that Brazil’s national police recently announced plans to find and “punish the authors of ‘fake news’” ahead of this year’s high-stakes presidential elections.  “We have this new phenomenon of fake news sites specifically targeting WhatsApp.” But WhatsApp adds another complication to Brazil’s fake news quandary: secrecy. Unlike the fully public Twitter, or Facebook, where posts are somewhat public and can more easily be tracked and analyzed by independent parties, WhatsApp is a closed, peer-to-peer messaging service. On WhatsApp, the most toxic aspects of fake news multiply: The platform exacerbates pockets of powerful echo chambers in a political environment already deeply polarized and makes tracking the reach and origins of disinformation particularly difficult for researchers, journalists, and, in Brazil’s case, the federal police.“We have this new phenomenon of fake news sites specifically targeting WhatsApp — this is probably going to be a problem in the 2018 [national] elections,” Ortellado said.  Total dominance  WhatsApp is nearly ubiquitous in Brazil: 120 million of the country’s roughly 200 million people use the messaging app, making it more popular there than any other app, including Facebook. Further, some 35 percent of its users regularly rely on the messaging platform for their news consumption, according to a WhatsApp-commissioned study. The volatile political climate in Brazil isn’t helping things, either. Brazilian society is mired in pervasive political corruption, rising racial tension, and extreme polarization. Additionally, Brazilian news media has contracted sharply over the past few years, as more people get their news straight from social media services and put less faith in traditional media. Similar dynamics in the United States led to the spread of fake news on social media during the 2016 election, according to a January 2017 paper published by Stanford University researchers.“You can have huge networks of people that are totally out of control and are unseen.”“The conditions that exist in Brazil are just ripe for people’s selective exposure, their confirmation bias, their tribalism,” misinformation researcher Claire Wardle told Bloomberg. And private, peer-to-peer messaging apps like WhatsApp are exacerbating that tribalism, said Rosental Alves, a professor of journalism at the University of Texas-Austin. “Families and every group you can imagine creates their own private social media network on WhatsApp, and those bubbles are totally out of the control of anybody else,” said Alves. “You can have huge networks of people that are totally out of control and are unseen.”  A representative for WhatsApp declined to comment on fake news in Brazil and noted that while none of the company’s roughly 250 full-time employees are based in Brazil, the company frequently meets with the Brazilian government. Read: Israel is now using Facebook posts to jail Palestinians But Alves says these networks on WhatsApp are “fertile for planting false information” that can spread quickly from group to group until it is “out of control.”   A heavy-handed response  The veil of secrecy enjoyed by fake news creators on WhatsApp has elicited a robust response from Brazil’s national police, with its new fake news task force experts and analysts worrying the app could quickly become a vehicle for greater censorship and suppression of free speech. Such fears were fanned last week, when a top police official threatened to invoke a dictatorship-era law in order to move forward with its task force, even if it has no such authority from the Brazilian legislature. This isn’t the first time WhatsApp has been the source of major political tension in Brazil. The platform has been shut down by Brazilian judges three separate times, most recently in July 2016 in a dispute over sharing data with the police. In March 2016, a Facebook executive did a brief stint in jail for similar reasons. The platform's commitment to user privacy has been lauded by journalists and rights groups. Read: Facebook has a problem with death threats in the Czech RepublicBut with fears mounting about the government’s heavy-handed response and a charged election season led by a former president facing jail time and a right-wing firebrand congressman hoping to become Brazil’s Donald Trump, the messaging app may soon be confronted with one of its biggest obstacles yet, warned a poli sci professor at Rio de Janeiro State University: Brazil’s military.  “The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) in Brazil recently decided that the army should be involved in repressing fake news,” said Mauricio Santoro. “It shouldn’t be the responsibility of the army to say what’s fake news.”

1469,4,,"WASHINGTON — Even as he is embroiled in an immigration policy debate that has focused on whether he used vulgar language to describe Haiti and African countries, President Trump is claiming that he is delivering for black Americans — and that they are repaying him with their support.

In a Twitter post on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said that “unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded” and “Trump approval ratings with black Americans has doubled.” He appeared to credit the comments to a segment on “Fox & Friends,” the morning program on Fox News.

The tweet — half misleading and half downright false — demonstrates how inaccurate information can trickle to the president’s social media, which is then is viewed by millions of people on Twitter and Facebook.

“Believe it or not, through all this negative coverage, they did a survey of 600,000 people about how black America views this president. His numbers have actually doubled,” Brian Kilmeade, a “Fox & Friends” host, said during the segment that was broadcast Tuesday morning.

Mr. Kilmeade was almost certainly referring to a distorted finding from Survey Monkey, an online polling company. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the company has conducted 602,134 interviews with adults of every race group — not just “black America,” as Mr. Kilmeade said.

1472,1,,"President Obama commuted the vast majority of former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning's 35-year prison sentence for leaking classified documents, the White House announced Tuesday.

The White House said that Manning is one of 209 inmates whose sentences Obama is shortening. Obama is also pardoning 64 people, including retired Gen. James Cartwright, who was charged with making false statements during a probe into disclosure of classified information.

Manning is more than six years into a 35-year sentence at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas for leaking classified government and military documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Her sentence is now set to expire May 17.

Manning was known as Bradley Manning at the time of her 2010 arrest, but revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman.

Manning accepted responsibility for leaking the material to WikiLeaks to raise public awareness about the effects of war on civilians, and has said she was confronting gender dysphoria at the time of the leaks while deployed in Iraq.

She attempted suicide twice last year, according to her lawyers, citing her treatment at Leavenworth.

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Manning, said the president's action ""quite literally save Chelsea's life.""

""We are all better off knowing that Chelsea Manning will walk out of prison a free woman, dedicated to making the world a better place and fighting for justice for so many,"" Stangio said in a statement.

CHELSEA MANNING'S REDUCED SENTENCE COULD STRENGTHEN ASSANGE'S CASE, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

""Thank you to everyone who campaigned for Chelsea Manning's clemency,"" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a message posted to Twitter. ""Your courage & determination made the impossible possible.""

Assange: ""Thank you to everyone who campaigned for Chelsea Manning's clemency. Your courage & determination made the impossible possible.""— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 17, 2017

In a conference call with White House reporters, an official said the decision to grant a commutation to Manning was not influence anyway by Assange or WikiLeaks. A separate White House official said that more commutations should be expected before Obama leaves office.

The U. S. Army declined to comment on the announcement when asked by The Associated Press.

In a blog post, White House Legal Counsel Neil Eggleston wrote ""with today’s 209 grants of commutation, the President has now commuted the sentences of 1,385 individuals – the most grants of commutation issued by any president in this nation’s history.”

""We must remember that clemency is an extraordinary remedy, granted only after the president has concluded that a particular individual has demonstrated a readiness to make use of his or her second chance,"" Eggleston added. ""Only Congress can achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure over the long run that our criminal justice system operates more fairly and effectively in the service of public safety.”

""Chelsea Manning’s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation’s most sensitive secrets,"" he said in a statement. ""President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won’t be held accountable for their crimes.”

The decision is expected to have a ripple effect on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the organization. Two former intelligence officers have told Fox News that a CIA WikiLeaks taskforce was set up to assess damage from the Manning leaks.

""I think it would strengthen his (Assange’s) position considerably,"" Tom Dupree, former Deputy Attorney General, told Fox News in a previous interview. ""If the United States government said we are going to pardon Manning for those offenses,  I think it makes it that much tougher to then say we’re going to drop the hammer on the person that published that information.""

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told Fox News that while pardons are a Constitutional tool in the president's repertoire, Obama is ""undermining our ability on criminal justice reform by granting clemency at an alarming rate.""

Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, received a pardon, the White House said. He pleaded guilty in October to making false statements during an investigation into a leak of classified information about a covert cyberattack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Prosecutors said Cartwright falsely told investigators that he did not provide information contained in a news article and in a book by New York Times journalist David Sanger, and said he also misled prosecutors about classified information shared with another journalist, Daniel Klaidman.

The Justice Department sought a sentence of two years, saying employees of the U. S. government are entrusted each day with sensitive classified information.

""They must understand that disclosing such information to persons not authorized to receive it has severe consequences,"" prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed this month.

On Tuesday, Obama also commuted the prison sentence of Puerto Rican independence activist Oscar Lopez-Rivera. The 74-year-old Puerto Rican independence leader was sentenced in 1981 to 55 years in prison for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the U. S. government. He was sentenced to another 15 years in prison in 1988 for an attempted escape.

Commutations reduce sentences being served but don't erase convictions. Pardons generally restore civil rights, such as voting, often after a sentence has been served.

Most of the other people receiving commutations were serving sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.

Jessica Jackson Sloan, National Director of #cut50, which looks to reduce the incarcerated population by 50 percent over the next 10 years, called Tuesday's announcement another action to address ""our broken criminal justice system.""

""For far too long, efforts to fight crime have missed their mark, breaking up families and harming the human potential in our most vulnerable communities,"" Sloan said in a statement. ""Thanks to President Obama’s clemency initiative, more than one thousand people who were given overly harsh sentences during the War on Drugs now have a second chance at freedom.""

One other notable name to receive a pardon was 79-year-old former baseball star Willie McCovey, who received two years' probation and was fined $5,000 in 1996 on charges related to tax evasion.

Fox News' Catherine Herridge, Jennifer Griffin, and Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

1473,1,,"If it sometimes seems like the idea of antibiotic resistance, though unsettling, is more theoretical than real, please read on.

Public health officials from Nevada are reporting on a case of a woman who died in Reno in September from an incurable infection. Testing showed the superbug that had spread throughout her system could fend off 26 different antibiotics.

“It was tested against everything that’s available in the United States … and was not effective,” said Dr. Alexander Kallen, a medical officer in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of health care quality promotion.

Although this isn’t the first time someone in the US has been infected with pan-resistant bacteria, at this point, it is not common. It is, however, alarming.

“I think this is the harbinger of future badness to come,” said Dr. James Johnson, a professor of infectious diseases medicine at the University of Minnesota and a specialist at the Minnesota VA Medical Center.

Other scientists are saying this case is yet another sign that researchers and governments need to take antibiotic resistance seriously. It was reported Thursday in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a journal published by the CDC.

The authors of the report note this case underscores the need for hospitals to ask incoming patients about foreign travel and also about whether they had recently been hospitalized elsewhere.

The case involved a woman who had spent considerable time in India, where multi-drug-resistant bacteria are more common than they are in the US. She had broken her right femur — the big bone in the thigh — while in India a couple of years back. She later developed a bone infection in her femur and her hip and was hospitalized a number of times in India in the two years that followed. Her last admission to a hospital in India was in June of last year.

The unnamed woman — described as a resident of Washoe County who was in her 70s — went into hospital in Reno for care in mid-August, where it was discovered she was infected with what is called a CRE — carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae. That’s a general name to describe bacteria that commonly live in the gut that have developed resistance to the class of antibiotics called carbapenems — an important last-line of defense used when other antibiotics fail. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden has called CREs “nightmare bacteria” because of the danger they pose for spreading antibiotic resistance.

In the woman’s case, the specific bacteria attacking her was called Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bug that often causes of urinary tract infections.

Testing at the hospital showed resistance to 14 drugs — all the drug options the hospital had, said Lei Chen, a senior epidemiologist with Washoe County Health District and an author of the report. “It was my first time to see a [resistance] pattern in our area,” she said.

A sample was sent to the CDC in Atlanta for further testing, which revealed that nothing available to US doctors would have cured this infection. Kallen admitted people in this field experience a sinking feeling when they’re faced with a superbug like this one.

“I think it’s concerning. We have relied for so long on just newer and newer antibiotics. But obviously the bugs can often [develop resistance] faster than we can make new ones,” he said.

Doctors and scientists who track the spread of antibiotic resistance — the rapidly proliferating swarm superbugs — see this case as a big red flag.

“If we’re waiting for some sort of major signal that we need to attack this internationally, we need an aggressive program, both domestically and internationally to attack this problem, here’s one more signal that we need to do that,” said Lance Price, who heads the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University.

There is international recognition of the threat, which an expert report published last year warned could kill 10 million a year by 2050 if left unchecked. In September, the UN General Assembly held a high-level meeting on antibiotic resistance, only the fourth time the body had addressed a health issue.

The woman in Nevada was cared for in isolation; the staff who treated her used infection control precautions to prevent spread of the superbug in the hospital. Chen and Randall Todd, a health department colleague, told STAT testing was done to look for additional infections, but so far none have been detected.

Johnson said it’s likely, though, that other people in the US are carrying similar bacteria in their guts and could become sick at some point. “It’s possible that this is the only person in the US and she had the bad luck to go to India, pick up the bad bug, come back and here it is, we found her and now that she’s dead, it’s gone from the US. That is highly improbable,” he said.

“People have asked me many times ‘How scared should we be?’ … ‘How close are we to the edge of the cliff?’ And I tell them: We’re already falling off the cliff,” Johnson said. “It’s happening. It’s just happening — so far — on a relatively small scale and mostly far away from us. People that we don’t see … so it doesn’t have the same emotional impact.’’

1474,3,1.0,"Former whistleblower and US Army soldier Chelsea Manning confirmed on January 14 she will run for the US Senate seat in the state of Maryland.

Manning, a former intelligence analyst, was sentenced to 35 years for leaking thousands of military and State Department documents to WikiLeaks, but the sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama. By then, Manning had already spent seven years in prison.

While some welcome an advocate of transparency throwing her hat into the ring, others are angry that a perceived ‘traitor’ is running for office.

RT discussed the issue with John Kiriakou, former CIA analyst and whistleblower, and John Griffing, US conservative commentator.

“I don’t think Manning has any chance of winning, but I am not sure winning is the point here,” Kiriakou said.

“What Chelsea really wants to do – is to get her message out. Ben Cardin, who is the incumbent senator that she is running against, is really very much of a neo-liberal Hillary Clinton kind of Democrat, not somebody from the progressive left. Chelsea is somebody from the progressive left. That is really what this race is about. It is about ideas,” Kiriakou continued.

Although Kiriakou hasn’t spoken to Manning in the last couple of months, he said that when he last did so, she told him her concerns were on issues of equality, war and peace, and military spending.

“I think what is mostly important to her are civil rights, civil liberties and human rights.""

“The funny thing about the US is that there is this almost automatic hatred toward whistleblowers. There is this attitude where you want to punish the messenger. Whether you like Chelsea Manning’s politics or not, she exposed evidence of war crimes, of crimes against humanity. And for that she should be celebrated, not criticized,” Kiriakou explained.

“But a lot of Americans, most Americans maybe, don’t appreciate that point of view. They see Chelsea Manning as, I’ve heard the word ‘traitor’ thrown around, which I think is ridiculous. It’s going to take a lot of convincing and a lot of hard work, if she intends to reach these voters in the state of Maryland,” he added.

According to Kiriakou, most Americans don’t understand exactly what Manning did.

“I think most Americans just think that she gave thousands of documents to WikiLeaks and that is bad because the government says that it is bad.""

“In fact, what she did was really the definition of whistleblowing – it was bringing to light evidence of waste, fraud, abuse or illegality. And it was that illegality, those war crimes that she exposed,” he added.

Kiriakou noted that “there is absolutely zero evidence that the information that Chelsea Manning released to WikiLeaks resulted in the death or in anything else of any American soldier, or American citizen or anyone working for the USA.""

“That is a red herring that the Republican Party has thrown out there into public debate and it is just simply not true,” he claimed.

In contrast, conservative political commentator John Griffing argued: “You are going to see a commuted traitor running for public office.”

“Sadly, this is part of the culture of leaks. And the Democratic Party has been behind Hillary servers, for example, in the last election cycle, were an issue because of these national security sensitive documents, classified materials that were released. And that is the same issue with Private Manning here. These are literally treasonous acts, these are violations of our national security laws,” Griffing told RT.

In his view, Manning did not serve time for her crimes: “she simply got off easy, there is no other way to describe it. This is a person who deserved 30-plus years behind bars.""

“The issue is that you are going to see a commuted traitor running for public office. And I think that the Democratic Party can do way better and have done better in the past. And they need to stop putting candidates forward on the ballot that have a criminal history,” Griffing concluded.

1475,3,1.0,"Researchers working at The University of Manchester have shown new possibilities for observing nanomaterials in liquids by creating a graphene 'petri-dish'.

New 2-dimensional nanomaterials have the potential to improve efficiencies, reduce costs and provide enhanced performance in a broad range of applications including; better design of nanomaterials for batteries or understanding the degradation of battery materials in order to improve their performance.

The unique properties exhibited by 2-D materials could also lead to functional and antibacterial coatings, bioanalysis, and targeted drug delivery. However, the difficulty of controlling growth and degradation at the atomic scale is currently a hurdle to fully exploiting the potential of these exciting materials.

Scanning / transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) is one of only few techniques that allows imaging and analysis of individual atoms. However, the S/TEM instrument requires a high vacuum to protect the electron source and to prevent electron scattering from molecular interactions.

Several high profile studies have previously revealed that the structure of functional materials at room temperature in a vacuum can significantly different from that in their normal liquid environment. This could be like trying to study the structure of a dehydrated prune to understand the structure of the original plum.

Publishing in Nano Letters, a research team led by Dr. Sarah Haigh and Dr. Roman Gorbachev at the National Graphene Institute and the School of Materials at The University of Manchester have shown that graphene and boron nitride can be combined to create a perfect nano petri-dish. Liquid samples inside the dish can be imaged with single atom sensitivity and it is also possible to measure their elemental composition at the nanometre length scale.

These engineered graphene liquid cells (EGLC) are built from 2-D material-building blocks: They consist of a boron nitride (BN) spacer drilled with holes (where the liquid is contained) and encapsulated with graphene on both sides.

Graphene is the ultimate window material—strong enough to protect the sample from a high vacuum environment, but at the same time thin enough that the resolution of the electron beam is not compromised. Lead author Daniel Kelly said: ""Unlike some previous designs our graphene liquid cells allow us to image the atoms for many minutes. We were even able to resolve individual atoms in water and observe them dancing under the electron beam.""

The researchers also demonstrated that these new graphene liquid cells enable an order of magnitude improvement in the quality of elemental analysis in liquid cells. They studied the deposition of a 1nm shell of iron on gold to grow core-shell nanoparticles. This new ability to monitor tiny concentrations over such small length-scales is a necessity for the increasingly complex chemical structures of high-performing nanocatalysts.

Mingwei Zhou, the student making these cells, said: ""We are getting to understand how to make these more and more reliably, this makes the 2-D petri-dish a promising route to further in situ TEM advancements, including imaging of small biological structures such as proteins.""

Why Uber Can Find You but 911 Can't

Accurate location data is on smartphones, so why don't more wireless carriers use it to locate emergency callers? From a report, shared by a reader: Software on Apple's iPhones and Google's Android smartphones help mobile apps like Uber and Facebook to pinpoint a user's location, making it possible to order a car, check in at a local restaurant or receive targeted advertising. But 911, with a far more pressing purpose, is stuck in the past. U. S. regulators estimate as many as 10,000 lives could be saved each year if the 911 emergency dispatching system were able to get to callers one minute faster. Better technology would be especially helpful, regulators say, when a caller can't speak or identify his or her location. After years of pressure, wireless carriers and Silicon Valley companies are finally starting to work together to solve the problem. But progress has been slow. Roughly 80% of the 240 million calls to 911 each year are made using cellphones, according to a trade group that represents first responders. For landlines, the system shows a telephone's exact address. But it can register only an estimated location, sometimes hundreds of yards wide, from a cellphone call. That frustration is now a frequent source of tension during 911 calls, said Colleen Eyman, who oversees 911 services in Arvada, Colo., just outside Denver.

1478,1,,"Las Vegas • A well-preserved horse skull collected more than 86 years ago from a cave near Las Vegas is helping scientists identify a new type of extinct, stilt-legged horse that died out during the last ice age.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Tuesday that scientists are calling it Haringtonhippus francisci after Richard Harington, an accomplished paleontologist who spent his career studying the ice age fossils of northern Canada and first described the stilt-legged horses in the early 1970s.

A team of researchers led by famed archaeologist Mark Harrington discovered the bone in the 1930s inside the Gypsum Cave east of Las Vegas.

Paleontologist Eric Scott says the fossil was initially mistaken for a modern specimen because it looked so fresh.

It was put away in museum collections, and was not revisited until recently.

1483,3,1.0,"If you are an animal lover, you know that dogs are a lifelong commitment. They are not ‘disposable.’ However, each Christmas, people purchase puppies as gifts and give them to owners that can’t or shouldn’t care for them.

The new owner had recently become homeless and could no longer keep or afford the puppy. The sweet, adorable boy is currently being held at the shelter to receive vaccinations, undergo medical exams, and receive a microchip. Once they feel he is ready, they’re certain he’ll be finding a new home soon.

“He’s so affectionate, even with new people, and loves a cuddle and a fuss. He also loves playing with toys and running around the kitchen. He’s such a sweet boy,” said Battersea staff member Alice Holt told Daily Mail UK.

“It doesn’t shock any of us that the first dog through our doors in 2018 was bought online,” Steven said. “Ronnie is just one of many thousands of dogs who will be bought off an unregulated website in the coming months and end up in a home where the owner is unprepared and unable to take proper care of them.”

Sadly, the veterinary staff believes that Ronnie was taken from his family much too early and probably sold by a breeder with no regard for anything but a profit. One of the biggest problems faced by animal welfare advocates is online dog sales.

The rescue group has recently launched a fundraising effort to help stray pets out in the cold temperatures this winter; it’s called ‘In From The Cold.’ With money raised, Battersea Dogs and Cats will provide a warm bed for abandoned dogs and cats.

Steven hopes that Ronnie’s story will help urge people to seriously consider the huge responsibility dog ownership entails. This is also a reminder to adopt dogs and puppies from shelters, instead of purchasing them online from inhumane breeders.

1486,2,,"If you’ve ever worked behind a cash register, you know how hard it can be. In truth, the customer is not always right, especially at the grocery store. Since most of us have to buy our groceries from somewhere, the least we can do is try not to aggravate the hard-working stock clerks, cashiers and baggers. Check out (pardon the pun) these folks’ biggest pet peeves…and maybe you’ll think twice the next time you’re strolling the aisles.

1. “If It Doesn’t Scan, I Get It for Free, Right?”

This is probably the most overtold joke in the grocery store, eliciting a groan from all but the most patient (or poker-faced) employees. Sadly, regardless of whether or not the scanner registers your item on the first try, you still have to pay for it…so resist temptation to use this shopworn humor on the cashier.

Pro tip: Most major grocery chains do, however, offer discounts on dented cans, and it’s fine to ask the cashier about this.

2. Neglecting to Say Thanks

It’s so easy to practice simple manners, and we promise it makes a world of difference to slow down, look an employee in the eye and thank them for their work. Small kindnesses go a long way toward making a person’s day.

3. Bringing More than 10 Items to the 10-items-or-less Lane

Lanes with this requirement were created for efficiency, so people with just a few items can, theoretically, get in and check out fast. Using the fast lane when you have more than 10 items makes the line longer for everyone behind you. Do your fellow shoppers a solid by using the correct lane, even if the wait looks a bit longer.

Most grocery stores offer cash back if you are paying with a card, but that doesn’t mean you can treat the register like an ATM. To ensure there’s enough cash to break everyone’s bills, most cashiers won’t be able to part with a roll of quarters in exchange for a handful of dollar bills. Try an arcade, a laundromat or an actual bank for that. (Maybe your grocery store has a bank inside, in which case, there you go!)

5. Leaving Items in Random Parts of the Store

Too many items in your cart? Instead of leaving a box of cookies in the produce section or ditching a case of soda in the cereal aisle, return these extraneous items to their shelves, or bring them to the cashier so they can be properly restocked. Doing so saves confusion for other shoppers and, in the case of frozen or refrigerated foods, ensures the products don’t get ruined. (Psst! Check out our list of grocery staples you can make at home.)

6. Scrutinizing the Receipt Right after Paying

It’s normal to wonder if you’re getting the best deal on your groceries, but analyzing the receipt immediately after the cashier gives it back to you is rude. Not only are you holding up the line; by looking for mistakes, you’re also making the cashier feel as if you don’t trust them. Wait until you’re out of the way to make sure the grapes weren’t accidentally scanned twice. (Chances are, there won’t be any errors.)

Sundays are by far the busiest days for grocery stores, and the employees have no control over that. To avoid the crowds, plan your trip for a different day. Be prepared for busier aisles in the weeks leading up to major holidays, as well.

Bringing children to the grocery store is encouraged, but save playtime for home, the park and the great outdoors. Young children are apt to mistake bright, shiny products for toys-which can be bad news for the child, not to mention the poor soul who has to clean up the spill on Aisle 3. That said, a supervised trip to the store can be a great experience for your tot. Have them read the grocery list aloud or help load items onto the conveyor belt (just be sure there’s not a line of impatient customers behind you). Looking for other ways to get your kids involved? Check out our guide to cooking with kids.

9. Handing over Coupons That Just Don’t Work

Every savvy shopper knows there are some wild discounts to be found in coupon books, but please remember to read the fine print. Coupons are useless if you try to use them past the expiration date, leave them at home or attempt to use one from another store. (You’d be surprised by what people will try!) Looking for more ways to save money in the kitchen? Try these affordable dinner party recipes!

10. Throwing Your Cash or Card onto the Counter

…especially if the cashier has offered their hand. Some find it awkward to transfer a fistful of wadded bills and loose coins into another person’s hand. But it’s more polite and makes the transaction easier on everyone.

This is the ultimate pet peeve of those who work in the service industry. Phone calls are a distraction and slow transactions down. Plus, it’s difficult for the cashier to know if you’re talking to them or to that device pinned between your ear and shoulder. (If you say thank you-avoiding pet peeve No. 2, above-will the bagger even know it’s directed at them?) Do us all a favor and place the call on hold when it’s your time to buy.

Now that you know grocery store workers’ bigger pet peeves-be honest-how many are you guilty of?

Among the reported members of the meeting were South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, and Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin.  The president’s remarks on Haiti followed an exchange where Graham and Durbin suggested allowing vulnerable countries to remain in the U.S. visa lottery program under the “Temporary Protected Status,” but cutting the entire program by half.  All of the legislators were taken aback by Trump’s comment, the Post reported. The White House declined to comment on the Post’s initial story, but later released a statement that did not deny Trump made the comments.  “Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,” Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement. “Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.” Trump’s interest in Norway may stem from the fact that he met with the Norwegian prime minister Wednesday. Trude Måseide, head of communications for the Prime Minister of Norway, reached on her cell phone in her kitchen at midnight in Oslo, said she could not immediately comment.   The Haitian embassy didn’t immediately reply to a VICE News request for comment.  But this is not the first time that Trump has reportedly slurred Haitians: He also said that the 15,000 Haitian immigrants who’ve received visas to enter the United States in 2017 “all have AIDs,” according to a December New York Times story. And Trump has a somewhat personal history with people from Haiti: Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, purportedly employs a number of Haitian workers, who are licensed to work through the H-2B visa. That visa program, which Trump has so far not objected to, allows low-paid laborers to work seasonally. And he’s benefitted from the problems plaguing Haiti in other ways, too — in 2010, the Red Cross paid to host its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago, with proceeds set to help victims of the 2010 Haitian earthquake and resulting devastation. That eighth anniversary of that earthquake is Friday. During his campaign, Trump reassured Haitian American voters in Miami’s Little Haiti that he shared “a lot of common values” with them. “Whether you vote for me or not I really want to be your biggest champion,” he told them. The political backlash to the comments has already begun.  “Under no circumstances is it acceptable to degrade, denigrate, or dehumanize #TPS immigrants,” Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo tweeted, referring to Temporary Protection Status recipients. “The White House must immediately explain the situation and leave no doubt regarding what was said and in what context.”Trump's comments place America's global moral standing at risk, said Hady Amr, a former state department official under President Barack Obama. ""America's leadership of the Free World is based not only on our military strength, not only on our economic strength, but also on the moral foundations of the idea of America as exemplified in the poem engraved on the Statue of Liberty in NY Harbor not far from where President Trump grew up,"" said Amr. ""Without that moral leadership, America is not seen as leader of the free world.""

On Wednesday, YouTuber Shane Dawson came under fire after a controversial clip from his old podcast, ""Shane and Friends,"" appeared online. An edited version of the clip from 2013, in which Dawson jokes about pedophilia, and googling ""naked babies,"" was allegedly first uploaded by YouTube channel Pop Blast, with the title: ""Shane Dawson is a pedophile. Here’s the proof."" Subsequently, the title changed to: ""I think Shane Dawson is a pedophile. Here’s my proof,"" reports Polygon. YouTube then deleted the channel, claiming ""multiple or severe violations of YouTube’s policy against spam, deceptive practices, and misleading content."" Dawson took to YouTube on Wednesday in an attempt to clear his name. During his video, he played a longer clip from the podcast, and apologized for what he said:  I wanted to play that clip in full, I mean that moment especially in full, just for context because that seems to be missing nowadays. I cannot believe that I am having to make this video. I cannot believe that this is happening. I'm gonna start by saying I am not a f****** pedophile... It's disgusting that people are saying I'm a f****** pedophile because of some s***** a** f****** jokes from six years ago on a podcast. Now let me explain a little bit more. Here’s what I’m gonna do. I’m going to apologize first. I am sorry that I used to make really s***** f****** jokes. I am sorry that I was so f******, like, insecure, and like, playing this character of this guy who's, like, crazy, and will say anything and tries to make everybody laugh by shocking them. That was my thing; that was what I did on YouTube. ... I loved the feeling of making somebody shocked and laugh because they couldn't believe what was coming out of my mouth. I wasn't confident enough to make smarter jokes. I was making the easy jokes. I was playing crazy stereotypical characters; I was doing s*** that was racially insensitive; I was doing s*** that was homophobic; I was doing s*** that could be considered fat shaming; I was doing some f***** up, like, comedy stuff that I'm not proud of. I’ve changed so much as a person, and as a creative, and a director, and a writer and stuff. Like, the stuff that I was saying back in those times, I would never say now.  Dawson went on to talk about his interaction with the Instagram star, saying the little girl had a ""Dance Moms type of vibe,"" and that he found that unsettling:  She was posting, like, really creepy selfies — and her dad was helping her, and it was f****** creepy, and it was, like, weird, right? So, of course I take that story and I talk about it on the podcast. Now, of course, what they didn’t also show in that video clip is me talking about how f****** creepy it was. But then I started making jokes about it.  Dawson then claimed that he never actually Googled ""naked babies,"" that it was a joke:  ... I am so sorry if that triggered you or offended you or hurt your feelings. It triggers me, listening to that clip. ... I don't even know what else to say. I'm not a pedophile. I made a lot of bad decisions as far as joke telling, storytelling, tried to make people laugh with shocking them. I mean, there's so many things I've done in the past that I'm, like, embarrassed of, ashamed of.  After adding that he himself was a victim of molestation, Dawson said:  I am sorry that these [remarks] are making people uncomfortable, but also it’s very out of context. When you listen to the full thing, it’s still, like, s***** and creepy and bad jokes, but it’s not me being a pedophile. ... I’m proud that I’ve grown up. I’m proud that I don’t make crazy jokes anymore. I’m proud that I’ve changed my channel to be more about good things, and cool things, and helping people...    As for the podcast, approximately seven minutes in, Dawson and his co-host were discussing things that upset them, and he brought up a six-year-old Instagram star he met:  We ran into a child...this child was probably six-years-old, and I was taking a picture of something, and the kid turns to me and goes, ""Oh, are you Instagramming?"" ... and the six-year-old girl goes, ""Oh, how many followers do you have?"" I mean, first of all, it was almost like one of those contests where it's like, ""How big is your ****?"" And this kid slapped her huge **** on the table, and was like, a six-year-old who goes, ""Oh, I have 125,000."" Her **** was almost as big as mine. ... and I said, ""Okay, LittleBig****, why do you have so many followers?"" And she goes, ""Oh, I'm a cheerleader."" And I'm like, ""Oh, really?"" And she shows me her Instagrams, which are like — first of all, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but she's like, sexy... Listen, I know we've talked about pedophilia before ... let me explain. Here's my justification for pedophilia. Ok, first of all, just let me say, having sex with children, or touching children, or anything of that nature is terrible and you should not do it, but here's my thing. People have foot fetishes. People have fetishes about, you know, everything. And there's websites on the internet where they can look at that weird creepy sh** and j*** off to it. Okay, fine, everybody do your thing. So why is it when somebody looks at — Googles like, ""naked baby"" on Google, and j**** off to it, they can get arrested? ... but here's the worst part of it. I actually went to Google, and I'm like...let me just pretend, let me pretend I'm a pedophile for a sec ... so I typed in ""naked baby."" First of all, I don't understand why anybody would be turned on by that, but [pause] they were sexy. I'm kidding!  Throughout the episode, Dawson’s co-host laughingly objected to Dawson’s language and when he asked why people are arrested for Googling ""naked baby,"" she said: ""Because somebody took a picture of a naked baby."" Here’s the podcast (pertinent portion begins at the 6:55 mark):  As of publication, Shane Dawson’s apology video has 3.6 million views, 461,000 ""thumbs up,"" and 4,000 ""thumbs down.""

Hostel searches in Ecuador spiked 556% last year — this backpacker's incredible photos show why

Ecuador, which is home to stunning waterfalls, jungle land, and idyllic nature trails, is fast becoming the most popular backpacking destination on earth.

Internet searches for hostels in Ecuador rose by 556% between January 2015 and June 2016, compared to the same period the previous year, according to recent data from the hostel booking site Dorms.com.

Travel blogger Jessica Festa, the founder of Jessie on a Journey, shared a selection of photos from her trip to Ecuador with Business Insider to show what the country has to offer.

Here's a glimpse into Festa's experience of Ecuador, with her own quotes.

The travel blogger began her trip in Vilcabamba, a picturesque village in the south of the country that's known as the ""Valley of Longevity."" It is home to ""one of the longest living populations in the world,"" Festa said, thanks to its ""natural mineral water and fresh mountain air."" There are also plenty of ""budget-friendly spas, meditation and yoga centres, and healthy eateries in town.""

An active traveller, Festa did plenty of hiking and cycling on her trip. On a hiking trip in Cajas National Park, near the city of Cuenca, she learned about Quinoa Forest, which is the world's tallest forest, perched at 13,124 feet. As well as beautiful scenery, the park is rife with myths. ""Because many [people] have died here from getting lost or altitude sickness the woodland is also believed to be haunted,"" Festa said.

The nearby city of Cuenca, in the Andes Mountains, is known for its culture. ""It's an extremely walkable city and is full of musicians playing in ambient squares, interesting museums and restaurants.""

""Cuenca is a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its rich history and unchanged urban plan."" The city's public squares, like Cuenca Market (below), are perfect for people-watching.

Another vibrant market can be found in the town of Otavalo about two hours outside Ecuador's capital, Quito. ""The colourful Otavalo Crafts Market features local goods mainly crafted from llama and alpaca wool.""

Festa also travelled to Baños, the second most populous city in the country, where she said there are ""colourful, creative and often eerie murals at every corner.""

Located in central Ecuador, the city is surrounded by nature. ""One hike I did from Baños was to Bellavista, an almost completely uphill trek. There are great views of Baños from above along the way.""

Of course, a visit to the Amazon Jungle, which is easy to get to on a tour from Baños, is ""a must"" when in Ecuador. ""This photo was taken in the Amazon Jungle, with my guide showing me how local indigenous peoples painted their faces to keep away 'bad air.'""

Festa also went on a cycling tour of some beautiful waterfalls around Baños, including the Pailon del Diablo, Ecuador's second-largest waterfall (below). ""I did it unguided so I could go at my own pace."" The views were incredible.

As for the food, it's arguably worth visiting Ecuador for the cuisine alone.

Festa recommends trying Choclo con Queso, grilled corn on the cob with sprinkled cheese — it is a popular street food that's easy to eat on the go.

She also tried guinea pig for the first time. ""It's one of the more expensive dishes, so while it was delicious I only ate it once.""

As well as great food, Ecuador is home to the ""Middle of the World,"" or Ciudad Mitad del Mundo, located an hour outside of Quito. ""Here you can straddle a line marking the equator. Though it's disputed even still if this is really the exact equator (many say it's actually 250 yards away)."" There's even a museum and shop selling souvenirs on the site.

A souvenir worth picking up in the city of Calderón, about a 30-minute drive from Quito, is one of these marzipan dolls, which were previously used in burial rituals. ""The handmade dolls are not edible as they're colourfully coated in glue and varnish.""

Nearer to Quinto, Mindo, a town that ""sits in the cloud forest"" in the Andes, is a fun place for a weekend trip with activities like ""zip-lining, bridge walks, and hiking.""

While she was there, Festa went to the Hostería Mariposas de Mindo, a hotel and restaurant that has a butterfly garden, which has more than 1,200 kinds of butterflies. Some are huge!

She also spent some time in Quinto, visiting historic attractions like the Church and Convent of St. Francis, an impressive Roman Catholic landmark from the 16th century.

From Quito, Festa flew to the Galapagos Islands. ""I got to swim with hammerhead sharks and seals, hike volcano rims, climb the Galapagos' tallest tree ... It's also pretty cool to see Galapagos fur seals wandering down the street when you're going to grab food.""

The islands are home to giant tortoise as well.

Pincha en la imagen para ver el vídeo donde el pequeño de los Hemsworth-Pataky desata la polémica en Instagram.

Cosas que pasan en Instagram y nos sonrojan como sociedad. Un hombre y una mujer ofrecen la misma información y solo se critica a ella. Todo parece de lo más inocente, pero despunta desde el subconsciente como un comportamiento más del patriarcado en el que vivimos.

Hablamos de esa pareja ideal que forman Chris Hemsworth (1983, Australia) y Elsa Pataky (1976, España). Los dos actores, casados y padres de tres hijos. Seguimos su vida en las redes sociales que ellos alimentan y nos congratulamos de que alguien en Hollywood sea realmente feliz. No parece fingir la familia Hemsworth-Pataky.

Y como son así de espontáneos, publican un vídeo familiar, cada uno en sus respectivas cuentas de Instagram. En la grabación, de 15 segundos de duración, Tristan (3 años), uno de los tres hijos de Chris Hemsworth y Elsa Pataky, aparece trepando por el frigorífico en busca de chocolatinas. Mientras los comentarios en el perfil de él aplauden la destreza del niño y lo comparan con el superhéroe al que interpreta su padre, Thor, muchas de las observaciones en la publicación de la actriz española son bastante críticas.

""Creo que tenemos que cambiar el escondite de los caramelos! #tarzán"", comenta en tono jocoso la actriz junto a la grabación casera. Sin embargo, muchos de sus seguidores no se tomaron a broma la ocurrencia del pequeño de los Hemsworth. ""Es peligroso. El mueble puede volcarse"", advierte alguien. Otros profundizan algo más: ""¿Y esto os hace gracia? Así está la sociedad... Niños sin límites. Mal"".

Las críticas se suceden: ""En cualquier momento se le cae la nevera encima"", ""deberías asegurarte de que todo está debidamente anclado a la pared"", ""madre mía, ¿y si se le viene encima? Yo no le dejaría..."", ""no se ve nada de seguridad"" o ""córtale el pelo""... Estos son algunos de los reproches que los seguidores le hacen únicamente a Pataky. Comentarios que chocan con el buen ambiente que destila el Instagram de Hemsworth, donde el actor acumula 13 millones de seguidores.

""Mi hijo acaba de encontrar el sitio donde guardamos el chocolate. Vamos a tener que buscar otro escondite. Tiene 3 años"", cuenta en el vídeo el protagonista de Thor: Ragnarok. ""No hay duda de que es hijo de Thor"", ""tiene a quién parecerse"", ""es como Spiderman"", ""no esperaba menos del hijo de Thor"", ""es miniThor"", ""el nuevo Jesús Calleja"", ""un atleta en proceso"", ""ya tienes sucesor como superhéroe""... bromean los seguidores del actor australiano.

En el perfil de Instagram de Pataky, con millón y medio de seguidores, además de críticas hacia la manera de mantener la integridad física de sus vástagos, buena parte de usuarios confunden a su hijo Tristan con una niña únicamente por el hecho de que le han dejado crecer la melena rubia. ""Ella es como un monete"", ""se nota que es la hija de Thor"", ""la madre que la parió"", ""tan pequeña y tan ágil"", ""mira, la hija de Thor"", apuntan algunos de los fans de la actriz, madre junto a Hemsworth de India Rose (5 años) y los mellizos Sasha y Tristan (3 años).

1500,3,1.0,"A Memphis megachurch gave a standing ovation to a pastor after he admitted to sexually assaulting a teenage girl just days before he conducted a workshop promoting abstinence.

Andy Savage apologized Sunday to his congregation Highpoint Church, after news reports revealed the woman’s allegations against the pastor — who has admitted they’re true.

The woman said she was 17 years old and a high school senior when she met Savage, who was then in college and working as a staffer at a Texas Baptist church now known as StoneBridge.

She told the Wartbridge Watch website that Savage drove her 20 years ago to a remote area, where he forced her to give him oral sex, fondled her and then jumped out of the vehicle, fell to his knees and begged forgiveness.

The woman said the incident caused lasting psychological harm, and she has recently filed a police report about the incident.

“I took every step to respond in a biblical way,” Savage said, reading from a prepared statement. “I resigned from ministry and moved back home to Memphis. I accepted full responsibility for my actions. I was and remain very remorseful for the incident and deeply regret the pain I caused her and her family, as well as the pain I caused the church and God’s kingdom.”

Savage told congregants he had never been involved in another similar situation, and he claimed to have notified his wife before asking her to marry him and lead pastor Chris Conlee before joining HighPoint.

“I was wrong and I accepted responsibility for my actions,” Savage said. “I was sorry then and remain sorry today.”

The pastor said he complied with the advice he was given by church leaders, but he now admits more could have been done to help the victim.

“I am truly sorry more was not done,” Savage said. “Until now, I did not know that there was unfinished business with (the victim), so I say today … I am truly sorry for my actions 20 years ago. I remain committed to cooperate with you toward your forgiveness and healing.”

After reading the statement, congregants rose to their feet in applause that lasted for nearly 30 seconds, and the lead pastor placed his arm around Savage’s shoulder.

“What Andy and I both know is that the support that you gave is also for (the victim),” Conlee said.

Mozilla said it was “investing in people, programs and projects” in a new initiative to “disrupt misinformation online” calling for a “Mozilla Information Trust Initiative,” or MITI for short, Business Insider reported.

They further stated the “internet’s ability to power democratic society suffers greatly” because of fabricated stories, such as the “Pope endorsing Donald Trump for the U. S. presidency” or a “dead FBI agent killed in a mysterious fire with information on former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton” – just two examples of stories that turned out to be bogus.

Mozilla’s innovations director, Katharina Borchert, told AFP that the organization was working on tools for Firefox and better online education with media groups, universities, and tech activists.

The “Mozilla Information Trust Initiative” comes just as an automated real-time fact-checking engine dubbed the “bullshit detector” was demonstrated in London.

The group that created the fact-checking engine, Full Fact foundation, is backed by Omidyar and our favorite billionaire tycoon Soros.

The organization stated its software is “capable” of spotting lies in real-time and was used to fact-check a live debate at the House of Commons. How that objective was achieved isn’t clear since it’s likely automated A. I., but algorithms are not 100% accurate.

“As the proponents of propaganda and misinformation become more sophisticated in their use of technology, it is important that fact checkers do not fall behind in our fight against it,” Full Fact said.

“This is an important investment in the future of fact-checking,” Stephen King, of the Omidyar Network, told The Guardian.

“You only have to look at the number of initiatives that have risen up to address this challenge, either by tech companies or other organizations to see how worrying this phenomenon is to so many,” Borchert added.

I worry more about those who want to act as fact checkers, blatantly ignoring propaganda and fake news by the MSM while targeting alternative media and dictating what is and isn’t important for public consumption.

“Whether it’s become a big enough priority is perhaps a better question,” Borchert said, arguing that it was time for rival news organizations to “rally around” each other to confront the spread of fake news.

Then you have Wikipedia founder, Jimmy Wales, planning to launch a crowd-funded news service called Wikitribune to help combat fake news.

So you have all these people, some of whom have even once advocated for a free and open Internet, now advocating for controlling the flow of information under the moniker of “fake news.”

How about all the fake news spread by the CIA and intelligence services called planted propaganda usually for pushing war? Especially as a new report questions the veracity of claims made by a shady firm Cloudstrike that “Russia hacked the election” – how about that fake news?

Putting the future of what we believe in anyone’s hands, let alone artificial intelligence, seems reckless; but a system backed by Soros and Omidyar seems like a dangerously stupid idea that can only lead to a path paved toward Orwellian censorship the likes of which even George Orwell couldn’t have imagined.

The organization stated its software is “capable” of spotting lies in real-time and was used to fact-check a live debate at the House of Commons. How that objective was achieved isn’t clear since it’s likely automated A. I., but algorithms are not 100% accurate.

“As the proponents of propaganda and misinformation become more sophisticated in their use of technology, it is important that fact checkers do not fall behind in our fight against it,” Full Fact said.

“This is an important investment in the future of fact-checking,” Stephen King, of the Omidyar Network, told The Guardian.

“You only have to look at the number of initiatives that have risen up to address this challenge, either by tech companies or other organizations to see how worrying this phenomenon is to so many,” Borchert added.

I worry more about those who want to act as fact checkers, blatantly ignoring propaganda and fake news by the MSM while targeting alternative media and dictating what is and isn’t important for public consumption.

“Whether it’s become a big enough priority is perhaps a better question,” Borchert said, arguing that it was time for rival news organizations to “rally around” each other to confront the spread of fake news.

Then you have Wikipedia founder, Jimmy Wales, planning to launch a crowd-funded news service called Wikitribune to help combat fake news.

So you have all these people, some of whom have even once advocated for a free and open Internet, now advocating for controlling the flow of information under the moniker of “fake news.”

How about all the fake news spread by the CIA and intelligence services called planted propaganda usually for pushing war? Especially as a new report questions the veracity of claims made by a shady firm Cloudstrike that “Russia hacked the election” – how about that fake news?

Putting the future of what we believe in anyone’s hands, let alone artificial intelligence, seems reckless; but a system backed by Soros and Omidyar seems like a dangerously stupid idea that can only lead to a path paved toward Orwellian censorship the likes of which even George Orwell couldn’t have imagined.

Mozilla said it was “investing in people, programs and projects” in a new initiative to “disrupt misinformation online” calling for a “Mozilla Information Trust Initiative,” or MITI for short, Business Insider reported.

They further stated the “internet’s ability to power democratic society suffers greatly” because of fabricated stories, such as the “Pope endorsing Donald Trump for the U. S. presidency” or a “dead FBI agent killed in a mysterious fire with information on former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton” – just two examples of stories that turned out to be bogus.

Mozilla’s innovations director, Katharina Borchert, told AFP that the organization was working on tools for Firefox and better online education with media groups, universities, and tech activists.

1510,1,,"RIO - De olho nas eleições brasileiras e após ser acusado de viabilizar influências externas nas eleições norte-americanas, o Facebook decidiu financiar projetos que tentam conscientizar os usuários da plataforma a identificar a disseminação de notícias falsas ou distorcidas, que mundialmente são chamadas de ""fake news"".

Duas iniciativas escolhidas entre oito projetos analisados pela rede social irão ser aplicadas apenas aos usuários brasileiros e devem estar disponíveis até junho.

Uma delas foi desenvolvida por professores universitários especializados nesse debate e prevê a criação de um curso online, que funcionará dentro da plataforma do Facebook, e ensinará o usuário por meio de vídeos, memes e testes a identificar conteúdos que possam estar distorcidos ou disseminando notícias falsas.

O ""Vaza, Falsiane!"", nome do projeto que recebeu investimentos de R$ 150 mil do Facebook, está sendo desenvolvido pelos professores Ivan Paganotti (MidiAto ECA-USP), Leonardo Sakamoto (PUC-SP) e Rodrigo Ratier (Faculdade Cásper Líbero).

— Esse tipo de iniciativa de educação para mídia que estamos desenvolvendo não vai resolver o problema das fake news. Serão necessárias outras soluções, como mudanças no algoritmo do Facebook ou mesmo o uso de pessoas para analisar e banir usuários que disseminam conteúdos fake news — avalia o professor Rodrigo Ratier.

O ""Vaza, Falsiane!"" vai tentar dialogar com o público mais jovem principalmente e, por isso, Ratier disse que haverá parcerias com redatores de páginas de humor e youtubers.

A outra iniciativa está sendo desenvolvida pela agência de checagem Aos Fatos e prevê o funcionamento de robô no ""Messenger"" do Facebook que orientará as pessoas sobre como trafegar na Internet fazendo suas próprias checagens nas postagens. Como identificar a data de uma publicação ou da divulgação de uma imagem ou vídeo entre outras alternativas.

A robô ""Fátima"" (nome que surgiu da abreviação da expressão FactMachine) também recebeu financiamento de R$ 150 mil do Facebook.

— O objetivo da robô Fátima não é dizer se o conteúdo é falso ou verdadeiro, mas ajudar o usuário a ter uma leitura crítica do que está acessando. E fazer suas próprias checagens — explica a diretora do Aos Fatos, a jornalista Tai Nalon.

Segundo ela, a conscientização é um meio eficaz para combater a ""fake news"", mas não a única. Para Tai, as notícias falsas ou distorcidas são como os vírus que circulam pelas redes e as pessoas vão aprender a lidar com elas assim como aprenderam a evitar os vírus.

A líder de parcerias com veículos de mídia do Facebook para América Latina, Cláudia Gurfinkel, disse que novas iniciativas devem ser financiadas pela plataforma neste ano.

— Temos dialogado com academia, agências de checagem, ONGs, empresas de tecnologia e empresas de mídia sobre o que podemos fazer juntos para reduzir a desinformação, e participaremos de mais iniciativas nessa área em 2018 — disse.

Essa não é a primeira iniciativa da plataforma no Brasil desde que ela virou alvo de investigação nos Estados Unidos. Em maio, o Facebook passou a revisar centenas de milhares de sites vinculados para identificar aqueles que contêm ""pouco conteúdo e um grande número de anúncios mal-intencionados"" e aplicou a inteligência artificial para ""entender se novas páginas compartilhadas na plataforma apresentavam características semelhantes"". A partir desse diagnóstico, essas páginas passaram a ter menos relevância na plataforma.

Um levantamento feito pelo Núcleo de Jornalismo de Dados do GLOBO com base em informações da plataforma Crowdtangle, ferramenta certificada pelo Facebook para medir a audiência de suas páginas, mostra que 11 perfis na rede social, atrelados a sites que distribuem notícias falsas ou distorcidas sobre política e não têm qualquer indicação do responsável pelo seu conteúdo, publicam, em média, mais de 200 posts por dia. As postagens dessas páginas são compartilhadas milhões de vezes no Facebook. Para se ter ideia, em maio deste ano, quando os sites de ""fake news"" tiveram seu melhor desempenho na rede social dos últimos 12 meses, mais de 5 milhões de compartilhamentos foram contabilizados em seus perfis. No mesmo período, as páginas de seis pré-candidatos à Presidência em 2018 com as melhores colocações nas últimas pesquisas de intenção de voto registraram 2,5 milhões de compartilhamentos mensais.

Apesar disso, os dados mostram uma queda significativa no patamar de compartilhamentos dos sites de ""fake news"" analisados pelo GLOBO. Entre janeiro e maio deste ano, em média, os compartilhamentos dessas páginas sempre se mantinham acima de 3 milhões. Desde então, essa média caiu paulatinamente, chegando a menos de 1,5 milhão no mês passado. Também houve queda no compartilhamento médio por postagem. Parte dessas queda pode ter a ver com as mudanças feitas pelo Facebook desde maio.

Mas as preocupações com o uso da plataforma nas eleições não se restringem à ""fake news"". Pela primeira vez, os candidatos poderão usar as redes sociais para comprar publicidade positiva por meio dos impulsionamentos.

Em outros países onde isso já é permitido, o Facebook e outras redes sociais como o Twitter e plataformas de busca como o Google também foram acusados de serem permeáveis à publicidade negativa contra candidatos. Nos Estados Unidos, eles estão sendo investigados pelo Congresso.

Para tentar dar mais transparência às publicidades eleitorais, o Facebook vai aplicar nas eleições para o Congresso norte-americano neste ano e, provavalmente, no Brasil também novas ferramentas para identificar claramente a atuação dos candidatos na plataforma.

Os candidatos terão que manter páginas no Facebook em que revelarão quais links estão patrocinando, para qual público e a rede social vai revelar a audiência dessas postagens. Com isso, a plataforma pretende evitar que os concorrentes usem discursos contraditórios para agradar públicos diferentes, um dos problemas identificados na eleição norte-americana vencida pelo presidente Donald Trump.

1513,1,,"A Facebook test that promoted comments containing the word fake to the top of news feeds has been criticised by users.

The trial, which Facebook says has now concluded, aimed to prioritise ""comments that indicate disbelief"".

It meant feeds from the BBC, the Economist, the New York Times and the Guardian all began with a comment mentioning the word fake.

The test, which was visible only to some users, left many frustrated.

The comments appeared on a wide range of stories, from ones that could be fake to ones that were clearly legitimate. The remarks, which would appear at the top of the comments section, came from a variety of people but the one thing that they had in common was the word fake.

""Clearly Facebook is under enormous pressure to tackle the problem of fake news, but to question the veracity of every single story is preposterous,"" said Jen Roberts, a freelance PR consultant.

""Quite the reverse of combating misinformation online, it is compounding the issue by blurring the lines between what is real and what isn't. My Facebook feed has become like some awful Orwellian doublethink experiment.""

Many on Twitter also expressed annoyance.

In a statement, Facebook told the BBC: ""We're always working on ways to curb the spread of misinformation on our platform, and sometimes run tests to find new ways to do this. This was a small test which has now concluded.

""We wanted to see if prioritising comments that indicate disbelief would help. We're going to keep working to find new ways to help our community make more informed decisions about what they read and share.""

Facebook has been under enormous pressure to deal with the issue of fake news since it was singled out as one of the main distribution points for hoax stories during the US presidential election.

In August it promised to step up its efforts to fight fake news by sending more suspected false stories to fact-checkers.

It also launched a new feature that published alternative news links beneath suspect articles.

1520,1,,"What is gender? This is a question that cuts to the very heart of feminist theory and practice, and is pivotal to current debates in social justice activism about class, identity and privilege. In everyday conversation, the word ‘gender’ is a synonym for what would more accurately be referred to as ‘sex’. Perhaps due to a vague squeamishness about uttering a word that also describes sexual intercourse, the word ‘gender’ is now euphemistically used to refer to the biological fact of whether a person is female or male, saving us all the mild embarrassment of having to invoke, however indirectly, the bodily organs and processes that this bifurcation entails.

The word ‘gender’ originally had a purely grammatical meaning in languages that classify their nouns as masculine, feminine or neuter. But since at least the 1960s, the word has taken on another meaning, allowing us to make a distinction between sex and gender. For feminists, this distinction has been important, because it enables us to acknowledge that some of the differences between women and men are traceable to biology, while others have their roots in environment, culture, upbringing and education – what feminists call ‘gendered socialisation’.

At least, that is the role that the word gender traditionally performed in feminist theory. It used to be a basic, fundamental feminist idea that while sex referred to what is biological, and so perhaps in some sense ‘natural’, gender referred to what is socially constructed. On this view, which for simplicity we can call the radical feminist view, gender refers to the externally imposed set of norms that prescribe and proscribe desirable behaviour to individuals in accordance with morally arbitrary characteristics.

Not only are these norms external to the individual and coercively imposed, but they also represent a binary caste system or hierarchy, a value system with two positions: maleness above femaleness, manhood above womanhood, masculinity above femininity. Individuals are born with the potential to perform one of two reproductive roles, determined at birth, or even before, by the external genitals that the infant possesses. From then on, they will be inculcated into one of two classes in the hierarchy: the superior class if their genitals are convex, the inferior one if their genitals are concave.

From birth, and the identification of sex-class membership that happens at that moment, most female people are raised to be passive, submissive, weak and nurturing, while most male people are raised to be active, dominant, strong and aggressive. This value system, and the process of socialising and inculcating individuals into it, is what a radical feminist means by the word ‘gender’. Understood like this, it’s not difficult to see what is objectionable and oppressive about gender, since it constrains the potential of both male and female people alike, and asserts the superiority of males over females. So, for the radical feminist, the aim is to abolish gender altogether: to stop putting people into pink and blue boxes, and to allow the development of individuals’ personalities and preferences without the coercive influence of this socially-enacted value system.

This view of the nature of gender sits uneasily with those who experience gender as in some sense internal and innate, rather than as entirely socially constructed and externally imposed. Such people not only dispute that gender is entirely constructed, but also reject the radical feminist analysis that it is inherently hierarchical with two positions. On this view, which for ease I will call the queer feminist view of gender, what makes the operation of gender oppressive is not that it is socially constructed and coercively imposed: rather, the problem is the prevalence of the belief that there are only two genders.

Humans of both sexes would be liberated if we recognised that while gender is indeed an internal, innate, essential facet of our identities, there are more genders than just ‘woman’ or ‘man’ to choose from. And the next step on the path to liberation is the recognition of a new range of gender identities: so we now have people referring to themselves as ‘genderqueer’ or ‘non-binary’ or ‘pangender’ or ‘polygender’ or ‘agender’ or ‘demiboy’ or ‘demigirl’ or ‘neutrois’ or ‘aporagender’ or ‘lunagender’ or ‘quantumgender’… I could go on. An oft-repeated mantra among proponents of this view is that ‘gender is not a binary; it’s a spectrum’. What follows from this view is not that we need to tear down the pink and the blue boxes; rather, we simply need to recognise that there are many more boxes than just these two.

At first blush this seems an appealing idea, but there are numerous problems with it, problems that render it internally incoherent and politically unattractive.

Many proponents of the queer view of gender describe their own gender identity as ‘non-binary’, and present this in opposition to the vast majority of people whose gender identity is presumed to be binary. On the face of it, there seems to be an immediate tension between the claim that gender is not a binary but a spectrum, and the claim that only a small proportion of individuals can be described as having a non-binary gender identity. If gender really is a spectrum, doesn’t this mean that every individual alive is non-binary, by definition? If so, then the label ‘non-binary’ to describe a specific gender identity would become redundant, because it would fail to pick out a special category of people.

To avoid this, the proponent of the spectrum model must in fact be assuming that gender is both a binary and a spectrum. It is entirely possible for a property to be described in both continuous and binary ways. One example is height: clearly height is a continuum, and individuals can fall anywhere along that continuum; but we also have the binary labels Tall and Short. Might gender operate in a similar way?

The thing to notice about the Tall/Short binary is that when these concepts are invoked to refer to people, they are relative or comparative descriptions. Since height is a spectrum or a continuum, no individual is absolutely tall or absolutely short; we are all of us taller than some people and shorter than some others. When we refer to people as tall, what we mean is that they are taller than the average person in some group whose height we are interested in examining. A boy could simultaneously be tall for a six-year-old, and yet short by comparison with all male people. So ascriptions of the binary labels Tall and Short must be comparative, and make reference to the average. Perhaps individuals who cluster around that average might have some claim to refer to themselves as of ‘non-binary height’.

However, it seems unlikely that this interpretation of the spectrum model will satisfy those who describe themselves as non-binary gendered. If gender, like height, is to be understood as comparative or relative, this would fly in the face of the insistence that individuals are the sole arbiters of their gender. Your gender would be defined by reference to the distribution of gender identities present in the group in which you find yourself, and not by your own individual self-determination. It would thus not be up to me to decide that I am non-binary. This could be determined only by comparing my gender identity to the spread of other people’s, and seeing where I fall. And although I might think of myself as a woman, someone else might be further down the spectrum towards womanhood than I am, and thus ‘more of a woman’ than me.

Further, when we observe the analogy with height we can see that, when observing the entire population, only a small minority of people would be accurately described as Tall or Short. Given that height really is a spectrum, and the binary labels are ascribed comparatively, only the handful of people at either end of the spectrum can be meaningfully labelled Tall or Short. The rest of us, falling along all the points in between, are the non-binary height people, and we are typical. In fact, it is the binary Tall and Short people who are rare and unusual. And if we extend the analogy to gender, we see that being non-binary gendered is actually the norm, not the exception.

to call oneself non-binary is in fact to create a new false binary

If gender is a spectrum, that means it’s a continuum between two extremes, and everyone is located somewhere along that continuum. I assume the two ends of the spectrum are masculinity and femininity. Is there anything else that they could possibly be? Once we realise this, it becomes clear that everybody is non-binary, because absolutely nobody is pure masculinity or pure femininity. Of course, some people will be closer to one end of the spectrum, while others will be more ambiguous and float around the centre. But even the most conventionally feminine person will demonstrate some characteristics that we associate with masculinity, and vice versa.

I would be happy with this implication, because despite possessing female biology and calling myself a woman, I do not consider myself a two-dimensional gender stereotype. I am not an ideal manifestation of the essence of womanhood, and so I am non-binary. Just like everybody else. However, those who describe themselves as non-binary are unlikely to be satisfied with this conclusion, as their identity as ‘non-binary person’ depends upon the existence of a much larger group of so-called binary ‘cisgender’ people, people who are incapable of being outside the arbitrary masculine/feminine genders dictated by society.

And here we have an irony about some people insisting that they and a handful of their fellow gender revolutionaries are non-binary: in doing so, they create a false binary between those who conform to the gender norms associated with their sex, and those who do not. In reality, everybody is non-binary. We all actively participate in some gender norms, passively acquiesce with others, and positively rail against others still. So to call oneself non-binary is in fact to create a new false binary. It also often seems to involve, at least implicitly, placing oneself on the more complex and interesting side of that binary, enabling the non-binary person to claim to be both misunderstood and politically oppressed by the binary cisgender people.

If you identify as pangender, is the claim that you represent every possible point on the spectrum? All at the same time? How might that be possible, given that the extremes necessarily represent incompatible opposites of one another? Pure femininity is passivity, weakness and submission, while pure masculinity is aggression, strength and dominance. It is simply impossible to be all of these things at the same time. If you disagree with these definitions of masculinity and femininity, and do not accept that masculinity should be defined in terms of dominance while femininity should be described in terms of submission, you are welcome to propose other definitions. But whatever you come up with, they are going to represent opposites of one another.

A handful of individuals are apparently permitted to opt out of the spectrum altogether by declaring themselves ‘agender’, saying that they feel neither masculine nor feminine, and don’t have any internal experience of gender. We are not given any explanation as to why some people are able to refuse to define their personality in gendered terms while others are not, but one thing that is clear about the self-designation as ‘agender’: we cannot all do it, for the same reasons we cannot all call ourselves non-binary. If we were all to deny that we have an innate, essential gender identity, then the label ‘agender’ would become redundant, as lacking in gender would be a universal trait. Agender can be defined only against gender. Those who define themselves and their identity by their lack of gender must therefore be committed to the view that most people do have an innate, essential gender but that, for some reason, they do not.

Once we assert that the problem with gender is that we currently recognise only two of them, the obvious question to ask is: how many genders would we have to recognise in order not to be oppressive? Just how many possible gender identities are there?

The only consistent answer to this is: 7 billion, give or take. There are as many possible gender identities as there are humans on the planet. According to Nonbinary.org, one of the main internet reference sites for information about non-binary genders, your gender can be frost or the Sun or music or the sea or Jupiter or pure darkness. Your gender can be pizza.

But if this is so, it’s not clear how it makes sense or adds anything to our understanding to call any of this stuff ‘gender’, as opposed to just ‘human personality’ or ‘stuff I like’. The word gender is not just a fancy word for your personality or your tastes or preferences. It is not just a label to adopt so that you now have a unique way to describe just how large and multitudinous and interesting you are. Gender is the value system that ties desirable (and sometimes undesirable?) behaviours and characteristics to reproductive function. Once we’ve decoupled those behaviours and characteristics from reproductive function – which we should – and once we’ve rejected the idea that there are just two types of personality and that one is superior to the other – which we should – what can it possibly mean to continue to call this stuff ‘gender’? What meaning does the word ‘gender’ have here, that the word ‘personality’ cannot capture?

On Nonbinary.org, your gender can apparently be:

The example of ‘(name)gender’ perfectly demonstrates how non-binary gender identities operate, and the function they perform. They are for people who aren’t sure what they identify as, but know that they aren’t cisgender. Presumably because they are far too interesting and revolutionary and transgressive for something as ordinary and conventional as cis.

The solution is not to try to slip through the bars of the cage while leaving the rest of the cage intact, and the rest of womankind trapped within it

This desire not to be cis is rational and makes perfect sense, especially if you are female. I too believe my thoughts, feelings, aptitudes and dispositions are far too interesting, well-rounded and complex to simply be a ‘cis woman’. I, too, would like to transcend socially constructed stereotypes about my female body and the assumptions others make about me as a result of it. I, too, would like to be seen as more than just a mother/domestic servant/object of sexual gratification. I, too, would like to be viewed as a human being, a person with a rich and deep inner life of my own, with the potential to be more than what our society currently views as possible for women.

The solution to that, however, is not to call myself agender, to try to slip through the bars of the cage while leaving the rest of the cage intact, and the rest of womankind trapped within it. This is especially so given that you can’t slip through the bars. No amount of calling myself ‘agender’ will stop the world seeing me as a woman, and treating me accordingly. I can introduce myself as agender and insist upon my own set of neo-pronouns when I apply for a job, but it won’t stop the interviewer seeing a potential baby-maker, and giving the position to the less qualified but less encumbered by reproduction male candidate.

Here we arrive at the crucial tension at the heart of gender identity politics, and one that most of its proponents either haven’t noticed, or choose to ignore because it can only be resolved by rejecting some of the key tenets of the doctrine.

Many people justifiably assume that the word ‘transgender’ is synonymous with ‘transsexual’, and means something like: having dysphoria and distress about your sexed body, and having a desire to alter that body to make it more closely resemble the body of the opposite sex. But according to the current terminology of gender identity politics, being transgender has nothing to do with a desire to change your sexed body. What it means to be transgender is that your innate gender identity does not match the gender you were assigned at birth. This might be the case even if you are perfectly happy and content in the body you possess. You are transgender simply if you identify as one gender, but socially have been perceived as another.

It is a key tenet of the doctrine that the vast majority of people can be described as ‘cisgender’, which means that our innate gender identity matches the one we were assigned at birth. But as we have seen, if gender identity is a spectrum, then we are all non-binary, because none of us inhabits the points represented by the ends of that spectrum. Every single one of us will exist at some unique point along that spectrum, determined by the individual and idiosyncratic nature of our own particular identity, and our own subjective experience of gender. Given that, it’s not clear how anybody ever could be cisgender. None of us was assigned our correct gender identity at birth, for how could we possibly have been? At the moment of my birth, how could anyone have known that I would later go on to discover that my gender identity is ‘frostgender’, a gender which is apparently ‘very cold and snowy’?

Once we recognise that the number of gender identities is potentially infinite, we are forced to concede that nobody is deep down cisgender, because nobody is assigned the correct gender identity at birth. In fact, none of us was assigned a gender identity at birth at all. We were placed into one of two sex classes on the basis of our potential reproductive function, determined by our external genitals. We were then raised in accordance with the socially prescribed gender norms for people of that sex. We are all educated and inculcated into one of two roles, long before we are able to express our beliefs about our innate gender identity, or to determine for ourselves the precise point at which we fall on the gender continuum. So defining transgender people as those who at birth were not assigned the correct place on the gender spectrum has the implication that every single one of us is transgender; there are no cisgender people.

The logical conclusion of all this is: if gender is a spectrum, not a binary, then everyone is trans. Or alternatively, there are no trans people. Either way, this a profoundly unsatisfactory conclusion, and one that serves both to obscure the reality of female oppression, as well as to erase and invalidate the experiences of transsexual people.

The way to avoid this conclusion is to realise that gender is not a spectrum. It’s not a spectrum, because it’s not an innate, internal essence or property. Gender is not a fact about persons that we must take as fixed and essential, and then build our social institutions around that fact. Gender is socially constructed all the way through, an externally imposed hierarchy, with two classes, occupying two value positions: male over female, man over woman, masculinity over femininity.

The truth of the spectrum analogy lies in the fact that conformity to one’s place in the hierarchy, and to the roles it assigns to people, will vary from person to person. Some people will find it relatively easier and more painless to conform to the gender norms associated with their sex, while others find the gender roles associated with their sex so oppressive and limiting that they cannot tolerably live under them, and choose to transition to live in accordance with the opposite gender role.

Gender as a hierarchy perpetuates the subordination of female people to male people, and constrains the development of both sexes

Fortunately, what is a spectrum is human personality, in all its variety and complexity. (Actually that’s not a single spectrum either, because it is not simply one continuum between two extremes. It’s more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, humany-wumany stuff.) Gender is the value system that says there are two types of personality, determined by the reproductive organs you were born with. One of the first steps to liberating people from the cage that is gender is to challenge established gender norms, and to play with and explore your gender expression and presentation. Nobody, and certainly no radical feminist, wants to stop anyone from defining themselves in ways that make sense to them, or from expressing their personality in ways they find enjoyable and liberating.

So if you want to call yourself a genderqueer femme presenting demigirl, you go for it. Express that identity however you like. Have fun with it. A problem emerges only when you start making political claims on the basis of that label – when you start demanding that others call themselves cisgender, because you require there to be a bunch of conventional binary cis people for you to define yourself against; and when you insist that these cis people have structural advantage and political privilege over you, because they are socially read as the conformist binary people, while nobody really understands just how complex and luminous and multifaceted and unique your gender identity is. To call yourself non-binary or genderfluid while demanding that others call themselves cisgender is to insist that the vast majority of humans must stay in their boxes, because you identify as boxless.

The solution is not to reify gender by insisting on ever more gender categories that define the complexity of human personality in rigid and essentialist ways. The solution is to abolish gender altogether. We do not need gender. We would be better off without it. Gender as a hierarchy with two positions operates to naturalise and perpetuate the subordination of female people to male people, and constrains the development of individuals of both sexes. Reconceiving of gender as an identity spectrum represents no improvement.

You do not need to have a deep, internal, essential experience of gender to be free to dress how you like, behave how you like, work how you like, love who you like. You do not need to show that your personality is feminine for it to be acceptable for you to enjoy cosmetics, cookery and crafting. You do not need to be genderqueer to queer gender. The solution to an oppressive system that puts people into pink and blue boxes is not to create more and more boxes that are any colour but blue or pink. The solution is to tear down the boxes altogether.

1521,1,,"On Monday, archaeologists announced they had found a 2,700-year-old seal impression from the First Temple Period that validates Biblical references from almost 3,000 years ago.

The seal was discovered near the plaza of the Western Wall Plaza in Jerusalem. Excavator Dr. Shlomit Weksler-Bdolah enthused, “The Bible mentions two governors of Jerusalem, and this finding thus reveals that such a position was actually held by someone in the city some 2700 years ago.""

It is likely that one of the buildings in our excavation was the destination of this transport, sent by the city governor. The finding of a seal with this high-rank title, in addition to the large assemblage of actual seals found in the building in the past, supports the assumption that this area, located on the western slopes of the western hill of ancient Jerusalem, some 100 m west of the Temple Mount, was inhabited by highly ranked officials during the First Temple period. This is the first time that such a sealing is found in an authorized excavation. It supports the biblical rendering of the existence of a governor of the city in Jerusalem 2700 years ago.

Hebrew University's Professor Tallay Ornan and Tel Aviv University's Professor Benjamin Sass described the seal impression thus:

Above a double line are two standing men, facing each other in a mirror-like manner. Their heads are depicted as large dots, lacking any details. The hands facing outward are dropped down, and the hands facing inward are raised. Each of the figures is wearing a striped, knee-length garment. In the register beneath the double line is an inscription in ancient Hebrew, with no spacing between the words and no definite article. The inscription denotes :lesar ha'air,” or “belonging to the governor of the city.” The title “governor of the city” is known from the Bible and from extra-Biblical documents, and refers to an official appointed by the king. Governors of Jerusalem are mentioned twice in the Bible: in 2 Kings, Joshua is the governor of the city in the days of Hezekiah, and in 2 Chronicles, Maaseiah is the governor of the city in the days of Josiah.

It is very overwhelming to receive greetings from First Temple-period Jerusalem. This shows that already 2700 years ago, Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, was a strong and central city. Jerusalem is one of the most ancient capitals of the world, continually populated by the Jewish people for more than 3000 years. Today we have the privilege to encounter another one of the long chain of persons and leaders that built and developed the city. We are grateful to be living in a city with such a magnificent past, and are obligated to ensure its strength for generations to come, as we daily do.

The seal impression measures 13 x 15mm across its face and is 2-3mm thick.

1524,4,,"Caetano Veloso e Paula Lavigne, o casal 20 (ou 40-13) dos famosos brasileiros, quer calar o MBL para impedir posts sobre sua conduta sexual.

Caetano Veloso e Paula Lavigne, o casal 20 (ou 40-13) dos famosos brasileiros, quer calar o MBL para impedir posts sobre sua conduta sexual.

Caetano Veloso, o músico, e Paula Lavigne, hoje atriz e que galgou fama ao perder a virgindade com o primeiro aos 13 anos, processam o MBL e Alexandre Frota, que registrou o MBL em seu nome, por danos morais, devido a posts em que o MBL teria “ferido a honra do casal” já que “acusariam Caetano de ser pedófilo”, segundo o blog de extrema-esquerda “Jornalistas Livres”.

A exigência de Caetano e Lavigne, com seus poderosíssimos advogados, é de indenização de R$ 100 mil de cada um dos seis réus, e pela imediata retirada das páginas do MBL de 24 publicações consideradas ofensivas aos autores da ação, sob pena de multa diária de R$ 5.000.

É difícil crer como o MBL poderia ter “ferido a honra do casal” ao dizer o que o próprio casal já disse: Paula Lavigne, ainda em 1998 (anos FHC, Brasil tetra, Spice Girls no topo) já havia se auto-revelado em entrevista à revista Playboy que perdera a virgindade com Caetano Veloso aos 13 anos, na festa de aniversário de 40 anos do cantor.

Além disso, Paula Lavigne também confessou que, quando criança, costumava levantar a própria saia, com a ajuda da irmã, e cobrar para permitir que meninos observassem o conteúdo.

Paula Lavigne indignou-se com o que a Playboy revelou antecipadamente à mídia na época, mesmo assumindo que tinha dito tudo. Na época, menos dada a envolvimentos políticos de extrema-esquerda como hoje, disse que não processaria (como processar? se auto-processar?) e que, se pudesse, preferiria se autopunir pelas declarações dadas.

“Eu me arrependi de falar. Não falo mais, em entrevistas, de minhas intimidades. Se eu pudesse, eu me processaria”, disse Lavigne. Foi ela que obrigou que o livro auto-biográfico Verdade Tropical, de Caetano Veloso, em que o cantor se jacta de ter freqüentado as intimidades de Paula Lavigne, tivesse passagens censuradas. A mesma Paula Lavigne, posteriormente e já famosa sem precisar ter relações com Caetano Veloso, contou o que nem o próprio Caetano havia contado.

Como se ofende uma honra dizendo que Paula Lavigne disse o que disse e admitiu que disse, ainda que qualquer um tenha vergonha alheia de suas palavras?

Ainda de acordo com o blog de extrema-esquerda “Jornalistas Livres”, no processo que movem contra o MBL, os poderosos advogados do casal acusam o MBL de ter “por prática habitual ‘perseguir, caluniar e achincalhar os Autores (Caetano e Lavigne)'”.

É uma informação estranha, mas quase um faux pas, um Freudian slip, um ato falho revelador: o MBL não chama Caetano Veloso de pedófilo: apenas aponta que o mesmo cidadão que deflorou uma então menina de 13 anos do alto dos seus 40 anos vividos hoje defende exposições supostamente “artísticas” em que homens na casa dos seus 40 anos estão com o pênis próximo ao rosto de crianças que ainda podem chegar a ter seus 13 anos.

O que há de “calúnia” em apontar uma homogeneidade de ações de Caetano? Calúnia é imputar crime a quem não o cometeu. Se há crime que o MBL imputou, então… até mesmo os poderosíssimos advogados de Caetano Veloso e Paula Lavigne (o curioso casal em que a dama nunca vem à frente) admitem que há algo, no mínimo, afrontador da lei… no que Caetano defendeu.

Os posts do MBL que o casal quer censurar também contam outro fato público e notório: a defesa do uso de dinheiro público (dinheiro do povo) para os gastos com artistas, mesmo que o povo prefira gastar seu dinheiro com outras coisas, como comida, do que com Caetano e Lavigne. Se isto é “calúnia”, novamente falta aos poderosos advogados do casal 20 (ou casal 40-13) que crime estaria em jogo – o que acabaria por mostrar malversações que não seriam exatamente do MBL.

Ainda de acordo com o blog de extrema-esquerda, os poderosíssimos advogados de Caetano e Lavigne escreveram:

“Os Réus fazem parte dessa parcela de pessoas que usam do alcance das redes sociais para perseguir, denegrir, ofender, injuriar, caluniar aqueles que discordam de sua plataforma política, de suas ideias, de sua agenda. A opinião alheia, se contrária à dos Réus, torna-se alvo de ataques violentos, verbais e, até, físicos, senão pelos próprios Réus, pelos seus seguidores, insuflados pelo discurso de ódio.”

Não é exatamente sem perseguir, denegrir, ofender e flertar com afrontas ao Código Penal (e mesmo com ataques violentos, verbais e, até, físicos) que os seguidores de Caetano e Lavigne, insuflados pelo discurso de ódio da esquerda, tratam quem discorda de sua agenda (esta, aparentemente, mais bem remunerada). Vide-se a página Ódio do Bem.

A classe artística brasileira encontra-se em total descompasso com o povo. Toda a litania de “é proibido proibir” que Caetano cantava na época da ditadura, quando Paula Lavigne ainda era um bebê, se mostra apenas hipocrisia e discurso falso.

O povo percebe cada vez mais que não tem por que incensar ídolos de importância e relevância episódica, pontual e limitada, ou não, e hoje certos músicos que eram tidos como revolucionários são apenas mais gente do showbizz e sua fabricação de celebridades via mídia, em linhas de produção fordistas. Todo aquele discurso que era idealista na Guerra Fria hoje se mostra simplesmente fantasia de adolescente que não conhece a realidade.

Quando Caetano e Lavigne tentam ir contra o povo, falam justamente através de palavras escandidas marqueteiramente, como “censura nunca mais”. O que acabam praticando é, justamente, algo bem próximo da censura: perseguem, insuflam seus seguidores e fazem ataques a quem apenas enxerga a obviedade ululante sobre eles.

Basta ver como o seu movimento, #342artes, mesmo sendo criado por dois seres conhecidíssimos no país, não agremia no Twitter mais do que mil seguidores, e teve tantas avaliações negativas no Facebook que preferiram tirar a página do ar para não passar vergonha (devem crer que é tudo culpa do MBL, “insuflando ódio”).

Se Caetano Veloso e Paula Lavigne se preocupam com a sua “honra”, poderiam ter uma história melhor a contar ao povo. Se Caetano Veloso tem vergonha de defender “performances” que flertam com a pedofilia, talvez fosse o caso de não defendê-las, de criticá-las. Se Caetano e Lavigne acham um absurdo lembrarem deles pelo uso do dinheiro público, poderiam fazer algo mais admirável do que gastá-lo.

No Twitter, a hashtag #CaetanoPedofilo chegou rapidamente ao primeiro lugar como assunto mais comentado do Twitter no Brasil. E agora? Caetano e Lavigne irão processar o país inteiro?

Ainda que o Código Penal não fale em “pedofilia”, o artigo 213 do CP define como “estupro de incapaz” a conjunção carnal forçada. Já no caso de menores de 18 e maiores de 14, não se fala em “consentimento”, já que o não-consentimento é presumido. No caso ainda de menor de 14, caso de Paula Lavigne, a pena subiria de 8 para 10 anos de cadeia.

Como estamos falando de Caetano Veloso, o crime pode prescrever diante do país inteiro que é apenas um pequeno dissabor. Errado e criminoso é quem critica. “Calúnia” vira dizer o que Paula Lavigne ela própria disse ao país. Ele é intocável.

A esquerda brasileira e seus intelectuais orgânicos como Caetano Veloso se distanciam cada vez mais do povo. Se fosse o Tião da construção que fizesse fiu-fiu para uma garota de 13 anos, haveria choro e ranger de dentes. Como é Caetano Veloso, é admirado, defendido por esquerdistas e feministas, pode censurar e se jactar contra a censura, pode torrefazer dinheiro público e rugir contra Temer, por ser corrupto.

Como o povo não iria se sentir numa casta inferior em relação ao todo-poderoso Caetano Veloso e seu discurso datado, ou não?

Alexandre Frota não parece colher bons frutos ao registrar a marca em seu nome, já recebendo seu primeiro processo em nome do MBL.

Fortunately for the many people who got worked up about that terrifying scenario, a team of scientists at Oxford say they've proven the theory is just science fiction.

Publishing their findings in Science Advances, the researchers came to the conclusion that the existence of a computer with the capacity to create a universe worth of simultaneous interactions is ""impossible.""

Research heads Zohar Ringel and Dmitry Kovrizh found that in order to store the information found in just a couple hundred electrons, the simulation computer's memory processors would require more atoms than the number that currently exist in our universe.

This pokes holes in the wholehearted beliefs of many big names in the scientific community who've publicly suggested that humanity is just the brainchild of super-intelligent programmers.

Funnily enough, the Oxford researchers had initially set out to study magnetic fields, only to later find themselves debunking the ""simulation hypothesis.""

1545,1,,"(UPDATED 1:53 p.m.) MANILA – The newly designated police chief of Mandaluyong City was administratively relieved of his post pending investigation of the Thursday night mistaken shooting by cops in a car chase that killed two civilians.

The vehicle that the policemen shot at was an AUV bearing six construction workers rushing a wounded woman to hospital, the NCRPO director, Gen. Oscar Albayalde said on Friday.

Albayalde announced the administrative relief of Senior Supt. Moises Villaceran, and 10 other police personnel, at a press briefing.

One of the two civilians dead was Jonalyn Amboan, who had been wounded in a prior shooting and was being brought to hospital.

Police are looking for barangay tanod Ernesto Fajardo and Gilberto Dulpo, who were in the Barangay Addition Hills mobile patrol. One of them was seen on CCTV firing at the white Mitsubishi Adventure bearing the mercy mission for Jonalyn as the barangay tanod were chasing the AUV.

Survivor Mhury Jamon, one of the three construction workers who survived, said that when the barangay tanod told them to stop, they did, and went out the vehicle as ordered. Still, two barangay tanod approached then shot at them, which Jamon believed caused the death of their fellow construction worker Jomar Jayaon.

Police who were alerted to the shooting incident, on seeing the barangay tanod pursuing the AUV, also gave chase, subsequently firing repeatedly at the vehicle.

Upon the arrival of the police, the barangay tanod left.

“‘Pag hindi kayo bumaba, papuputukan namin kayo (If you don’t go down from the vehicle, we will shoot you),” Jamon quoted the police as saying. By this time, he and the two other survivors were already down on the floor outside of the vehicle.

But the victims could not go out, he said, because Amboan was lying on husband and construction worker Eliseo Aluad. Jayaon had already been shot, as well.

“Sumisigaw kami na pasyente ang dala namin. Pero hindi kami pinakinggan. Pinadapa lang kami ng mga pulis (We were shouting that we were bringing an injured person with us. But they didn’t listen. The police just made us drop down),” Jamon told reporters. He said they then heard shots and shouting from inside the AUV, with one man – presumably Aluad – telling police they had to bring his wounded wife to hospital.

Asked how the shooting stopped, Jamon replied that it was probably because there was no longer any sound coming from persons in the vehicle.

Asked if there were violations of the rules of engagement on the part of the police, Albayalde replied, “Sa tingin naman natin meron siguro.

They recovered 36 shells on the scene.

“We’re not discounting the fact na merong [there was an] overkill; or violation of the POP (Police Operational Procedure),” Albayalde added.

While police had said they were just following the guidance provided by the barangay tanod that the men inside the AUV were suspects, they were bound to follow the POP that says “if there is no active shooter from the other side, there is no reason to shoot,” Albayalde explained.

“We have to look into whether there was abuse of discretion,” he added.

No amount of training could shape “the common sense and the discretion of our policemen,” Albayalde said. These were the most important things for them to have on the ground.

A team from the PNP Internal Affairs Service (IAS) was at the scene to investigate the case.

PSupt. Agtara, deputy chief, was temporarily assigned in lieu of Villaceran.

After the press conference held at the Mandaluyong Police headquarters, Albayalde told the policemen, “Walang mag-a-AWOL sa inyo (Not one of you should go AWOL).”

Asked if the barangay tanod who had given the wrong information were responsible for the incident, Albayalde said they were. This was exactly what the police was looking into now, aside from why the barangay officials had guns.

The police had barangay official Wilmer Doron in their custody, as he fled the mobile patrol when the driver told him the people they were pursuing were armed and were shooting at them. Doron went straight to the barangay hall to hide, Albayalde said.

All the four men with whom the construction workers had quarreled with, and which triggered the shooting of Jonalyn, are now under police custody.

Meanwhile, the area where the incident occurred has been cordoned off, with the Scene of the Crime Operatives conducting their investigation there. (Photos by Bernard Testa, InterAksyon.)

Nonetheless, arrogant frontman Bono still somehow believes that he is culturally relevant and thus entitled to lecture America’s sitting President on what he should not do.

Bono, born Paul Hewson, recently reached an all-time personal high in terms of arrogance and deludedness when he decreed in an interview that he was not interested in working with Republican President Donald Trump.

Bono never stopped to think about the obvious fact that President Trump has no reason whatsoever for “working” with Bono, an entertainer, and certainly not devoted a single second as President to wondering whether or not Bono wants to work with him.

In an interview with equally irrelevant Rolling Stone, Bono whined that President Trump did not personally intervene to stop the cost saving measures recently applied to pet leftist program PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). Said narcissistic Bono,“I realized I couldn’t work with this president whether he wanted to or not, because you can’t believe what he says.”

The singer then said that America under Trump is “the bleakest era since Nixon” and claimed, “It surely undermines the very idea of America, what is going on now … we know some who should know better have tried to piggyback the man’s celebrity to get stuff done. They will live to regret it.” Do you think Bono needs to stick to singing songs?

So now the UN will have to make do with less… Doing God knows what.

Just last week the mainstream media said that Donald Trump would not follow through on his threats and analysts were saying that it was all hot air.

Again just like the election the mainstream media has been proven false and have egg all over their face.

Some even say the United Nations will cease to exist because of this which probably isn’t true but would be wonderful if it were.

The United Nations is now saying that they can’t function and do their job properly without this aide.

Adrian Pearce, his ex-girlfriend Vicki, and the present. Photos via Facebook

This article originally appeared on VICE Canada.

Lots of people are guilty of hanging on to mementos from previous relationships.

For years, I held onto movie tickets from my first date with an ex. (To be fair, I actually forgot I had them after a while.) Some people even keep old weddings rings, though I’m not sure why you wouldn’t just pawn that shit. But Adrian Pearce of Edmonton, Canada is taking sentimentality to the next level.

Pearce, 64, has preserved a Christmas present from his ex-girlfriend for the last 47 years—and he still hasn’t opened it. He told the Canadian Press his ex, Vicki, dumped him when he was 17 years old, but gave him the present the same day, a parting gift of sorts.

""I had a long walk home and I was all upset and angry, and all the things you feel when somebody breaks up with you,"" Pearce said, noting Vicki was his first serious girlfriend.

""And so I put the present under the Christmas tree. After my family opened their gifts at Christmas, there was still one Christmas gift left and it's the gift this girl Vicki had given me. I told my family I'm never going to open that present.""

Fast forward nearly half a century, and Pearce has stuck true to his word—he has not unwrapped Vicki’s gift. Over the years, Pearce reconnected with Vicki a couple times but, as often the case, the sparks weren’t there anymore. Nonetheless, Pearce stuck to his tradition of trotting out her present every Christmas and not opening it. Eventually, he said, it made his wife mad. She told him to stop putting it under the Christmas tree.

These days, he said he just privately stares at the gift every year before putting it away again. (Perhaps not the solution his wife was hoping for, though he claims she enjoys the mystery of it all too.)

But Pearce said this year he actually tried looking Vicki up again, only none of the numbers he tried ended up working out.

For now, he said he enjoys “looking at it and having the pleasure of not opening it.” But he may open it on the 50 anniversary of receiving it and host a “contest,” asking people to guess its contents, with the proceeds going to charity. He’s also kind of hoping he can track down Vicki by then so she can “share in the celebration.” We wouldn’t hold our breath.

1559,1,,"Actor Matt Damon is being excoriated on social media for saying a very simple, but apparently controversial, thing about sexual harassment.

What did he say?

Much of the furor seemed to surround his comment that there is a spectrum of sexual harassment, and in the current hysteria over all the claims, they’re being equated unfairly.

“I think we’re in this watershed moment,” Damon said. “I think it’s great. I think it’s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it’s totally necessary.”

“Do believe that there’s a spectrum of behavior, right?” he added.  “And we’re going to have to figure — you know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated, right?”

“You know, we see somebody like Al Franken, right?” he explained. “I personally would have preferred if they had an Ethics Committee investigation, you know what I mean? It’s like at what point — you know, we’re so energized to kind of get retribution, I think.”

What was the reaction?

Damon was nearly universally bashed on social media by those who thought his comments were not sufficiently liberal on the subject of sexual harassment.

Actress Alyssa Milano explained in a Twitter thread why his comments were unacceptable:

It’s the micro that makes the macro.

We are in a “culture of outrage” because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous.

I have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt. And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted–even welcomed– misogyny.

We are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal. We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long.

Sorry to report that Matt Damon and Ben affleck , the men behind classic films such as What If Someone From Boston Were Smart , What if Someone From Boston Outsmarted the Cops & What if Someone From Boston Lost a Baby  turned out to be … bad

Liberal Think Progress editor Judd Legum said simply, “Matt Damon has some thoughts about sexual predators in Hollywood that everyone should ignore.”

The problem with responses like the ones Tom Hanks & Matt Damon gave today is that men are taught their opinion is important even if it's about an issue they don't know much about, while women are taught to apologize for their opinions even when they're well versed in the topic.

A few disagreed, like Emma Vigeland of The Young Turks, a far left YouTube channel:

Serious question: What did Matt Damon say that was wrong?

There IS a difference between what Louis C. K. and Weinstein did, and they should not be conflated. I don't understand how this is controversial. At. All.

1560,1,,"Donald Trump promised to help out American steelworkers during the presidential campaign by enacting tariffs on foreign steel imports.

The New York Times reports, the president has yet to put those tariffs into effect — and it’s forcing the steel industry to lay off workers.

His lack of action so far on tariffs has actually made things progressively worse for American steel because foreign manufacturers have been rushing to dump cheap steel onto the market before tariffs hit.

“According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, which tracks shipments, steel imports were 19.4 percent higher in the first 10 months of 2017 than in the same period last year,” the publication writes.

The Trump administration does have its reasons for not acting on steel tariffs, as American auto manufacturers have said they might have to conduct layoffs of their own if they have to pay more for steel made in America.

However, that’s of little comfort to steel workers who backed Trump expecting immediate action to help protect their jobs. Chuck Hauer, a pro-Trump steelworker who is likely to be laid off from his steel plant job in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, says he understands why Trump is holding off — but he says the workers at plants can’t wait much longer.

“He’s just delaying it,” he tells the Times. “And I think the delay is hurting us more than he knows.”

1562,1,,"Arizona police officer Philip Brailsford became known on the internet after he was caught on video shooting and killing pest control worker Daniel Shaver. However, before Brailsford was acquitted of murdering Shaver—who was innocent and unarmed—he reportedly had a history of violent behavior.

In January 2016, police arrived at the hotel Shaver was staying in after someone claimed they saw a man with a rifle. While Shaver did have a gun in his room, it was a pellet gun using in his business of pest control. Last week, a jury found Brailsford not guilty in Shaver’s homicide. However, there are still members of the public who do not believe he is innocent, and they are determined to prove Brailsford’s true character.

A recording resurfaced in the days following the verdict that shows Brailsford and other Mesa PD officers making contact with what appears to be a group of teenagers—some of whom were reported to be gay—inside a convenience store. Brailsford wasted no time in escalating the encounter, it seems, when he grabbed a young man by the neck and threw him violently to the ground. He is the officer closest to the camera.

One of the boys attempted to exert his rights to be treated humanely by insisting there was no need for him to “get on the ground” as the officers demanded, given that he was already in handcuffs. The officers, possibly knowing they were being recorded, went to an outer aisle where they began throwing the young man against the product displays, making a mess of the store. One officer then began kicking the handcuffed boy in the stomach. Instantly, they slammed him to the ground to finish securing the cuffs.

The incident in the video below serves to illustrate the violent nature of the Mesa PD, which chose to escalate rather than de-escalate a situation—arguably one that could have been easily defused. Unfortunately, the complaints against Brailsford were ignored as he was able to keep his job until the point at which he killed Shaver.

The Justice For Daniel Shaver Facebook page uploaded the video on Monday with the following caption:

had many excessive use of force complaints against him. Between this and the “you’re fucked” inscription on his AR15– it was only a matter of time before someone fell victim to his mindset. unfortunately happened to be that person.

As the Facebook page demands justice for Shaver, civil lawsuits are making their way through the court system. Others are not so gracious or patient, and they are demanding “street justice” for Shaver.

While it has been said that justice is blind, it seems once again a police officer has been given a license to abuse (badge). He then used that badge to violate the civil rights of numerous citizens, eventually killing a father of two young children. Some say he got away with murder. Cop apologists, however, applaud him for “doing his job.”

Even though the public was in an uproar over previous civil rights violations, and apparently attempted to tell Mesa PD there was a problem with one of its officers,  unfortunately, the department did not listen. And if they were listening, they did not take preventative action soon enough to save Shaver’s life.

Mesa’s police chief at the time of the killing was John Meza. In March 2016, Meza fired Brailsford after the officer was charged with Shaver’s murder but for crimes he’d committed on the force unrelated to killing Shaver. The subsequent investigation into Brailsford found he had engraved the rifle he used to kill Shaver with the words “You’re Fuckedd.” That was a violation of police department policy, and he was terminated.

It was the first time in Mesa PD history, according to the police officer’s union, that an officer was terminated under those circumstances. Predictably, the union objected to his firing. It is unclear if they will attempt to get Brailsford rehired with the department—now that he has been found not guilty and Chief Meza is no longer with the department.

A fundraiser has been set up by Daniel Shaver’s widow to take care of the family’s needs while the civil suit is proceeding.

1569,1,,"Juristen Lars-Nila Lasko som arbetar mot diskriminering menar att rättsväsendet äntligen börjat ta hatbrott mot samer på allvar. (Foto: privat)

""Nu tas anmälningar om hets mot samer på allvar""

En 68-årig man dömdes på torsdagen för hets mot folkgrupp efter att hetsat mot samer. Domen tyder på ett trendbrott inom rättsväsendet, uppger juristen Lars-Nila Lasko som jobbar mot diskriminering av samer. Första gången någon fälldes för hets mot samer var 2016.

– Tidigare lades alla fall ned av åklagare och de gick aldrig till domstol. Första gången som någon dömdes för att hetsa mot samer var förra året och i och med den domen skedde en stor förändring. Nu tas anmälningar om hets mot samer på allvar. Det är ett trendbrott, säger Lars-Nila Lasko jurist och tidigare ordförande i Samiska Rättsförbundet.

Efter domen 2016 dömdes nyligen ytterligare en person för att ha hetsat mot samer på sociala medier, enligt Lasko. Igår föll domen i Gällivare tingsrätt mot en 68-årig man som på Facebook skrivit rasistiskt om samer. Tingsrätten slår fast att 68-åringen i sin text gjort skillnad på samer och civiliserade människor.

Mannen ""har uppsåtligen uttryckt missaktning av samer"", skriver tingsrätten i domen.

Han döms för hets mot folkgrupp och förolämpning till dagsböter.

Lars-Nila Lasko säger att de senaste domarna mot personer som hetsar mot samer har fått direkta effekter.

- Det har påverkat mycket. Om vi tittar på Facebook till exempel har det tidigare varit väldigt mycket rasism mot samer och plötsligt har det upphört. Folk har förstått att det är farligt att hålla på med. Det är positivare att läsa på Facebook idag. Domarna har förändrat normer.

Hur kan det ha dröjt så länge innan någon dömts för hets mot samer?

- Jag är uppväxt i norr och när jag gick i skolan kastade man stenar mot oss. Vuxna kastade på småbarn. Så här i efterhand så tänker man att det är otroligt, men då var det en naturlig del av livet.  Tidigt 2000 förbjöd kommunen i Kiruna att samiska flaggan fick hissas på kommunens flaggstänger.

- Det har skett en enorm utveckling de senaste 15 åren. När vägverket blev skyldiga i början av 2000-talet att sätta upp vägskyltar även på samiska blev det ett himla liv. Folk sprejade eller satte upp klistermärken över samiska vägskyltar. Idag sker inte det. Det finns fortfarande en mycket starkt rasism mot samer, men man vågar inte uttrycka det på samma sätt. Jag tror att det är normer söderifrån som påverkat, säger Lasko.

John Ausonius, även känd som ""Lasermannen"", står inför rätta i Tyskland för ett mord 1992. Ausonius nekar till brottet.

Brandbomber har hittats vid ett judiskt kapell i Malmö. Polisen rubricerar händelsen som försök till mordbrand. Det rapporterar Sveriges radio.

1570,1,,"Använder du ”N-ordet”? Kanske ”Z-ordet”? Säger du ”handikapp”?

De flesta av oss är i alla fall medvetna om hur kontroversiellt det är med såväl ”N-ordet” som ”Z-ordet”. En del av oss är också på det klara med att begreppet ”handikapp” är förpassat till historien. Många tar sig rätten att, med en dåres envishet, fortsätta nedvärdera och kränka utsatta minoriteter, trots att det finns så många argument för att begagna de modernare, mer neutrala begreppen. Det enda argument de har för att fortsätta kränka andra människor är att ”Det har alltid hetat så”, ”Det heter så” och ”Jag har alltid sagt så, så varför ska jag ändra på mig nu?”.

Vad många inte vet är att ”lapp” är ett nedvärderande och kränkande uttryck. I fortsättningen av artikeln kommer jag att använda mig av ”L-ordet”.

Vad är det nu med ”L-ordet” då, tänker ni? Ska man inte kunna säga någonting nuförtiden? För mig räcker det med att individen själv inte vill bli kallad ”L-ordet”. Och vad är anledningen till att begreppet anses nedsättande? Jo, samer har historiskt sett blivit benämnda med ”L-ordet”. ”L-ordet” finns inte i det samiska språket och många samer vill idag inte bli kallade ”L-ordet”. ”L-ordet” härrör troligen från finskans ”lappalainen” som i sig betyder ”lapsk/från Lappland”, och det finns tolkningar som gör gällande att ”L-ordet” kan ha betydelsen av ”en som bor långt borta/avsides” eller ”dom andra” – alltså ett ord för att särskilja människor*.

Ordet har, med andra ord, inte heller sitt ursprung i samernas egna sinnevärld. ”L-ordet” är föråldrat, stigmatiserande och kränkande. Ordet ”same” kommer från samiskans ”sápmelas” och betyder ”människa”. Tänka sig, människor vill bli kallade för vad de är.

Samer har genom historien varit utsatta för övergrepp i form av rasbiologiska experiment och rashygien. Undersökningar, fotografering och skallmätningar (utförda med speciella verktyg) utgjorde viktiga pusselbitar i s k ”Lappundersökningar” (bok utgiven 1941).

”L-ordet” hänger kvar i massvis av ordsammansättningar, namn på djurarter och ortsnamn. Är det dags att tänka om och finna nya ord? Det är inte första gången man, i så fall, byter namn på en ort, eller djurart. Eller är behovet av att vi ”måste” hålla oss kvar vid de gamla, kränkande benämningarna större än respekten för våra medmänniskor?

Exempel på ordsammansättningar med ”L-ordet” är:

Exempel på namn på djurarter med ”L-ordet” är:

Exempel på ortsnamn med ”L-ordet” är:

Vad är det som säger att vi inte skulle kunna använda oss av andra benämningar eller de samiska benämningarna? Som exempel skulle Lapporten, i så fall, få heta Tjuonavagge. Det låter väl finfint?

Så länge ”L-ordet” lever kvar i ortsnamn, namn på djurarter och i diverse ordsammansättningar blir det svårt att kräva av gemene man att man inte ska använda sig av ”L-ordet”. För att vi ska komma dithän måste det förmodligen till förändringar i attityder kring vedertagna uttryck. Varför inte börja med att byta namn på landskapet? Jag föreslår ”Sameland”, alternativt ”Sápmi” som nytt och fräscht namn på vårt nordligaste landskap.

Vem har egentligen tolkningsföreträde för vad som är rasistiskt eller kränkande? Är det du, eller är det den historiskt utsatta minoriteten?

Se dig själv i spegeln och fråga dig om det är viktigt för dig att fortsätta hävda din rätt att svänga dig med det (för dig) ”riktiga” ordet och samtidigt kränka medmänniskor. Eller är det kanske så att det är en självklarhet att lämna de föråldrade, stigmatiserande och nedvärderande uttrycken åt historien, så att vi kan få ett samhälle som inkluderar alla, oavsett?

Och nej, argumentet att ”det alltid har hetat så” eller att vissa i den utsatta gruppen använder benämningen är inte legitima argument.

On topic, kuriosa och en självklarhet: Till skillnad från Björn Söder anser jag att det går finfint att vara same OCH svensk samtidigt.

Du följer nu :  (sparas i Mitt DN)”Det har blivit en skitstorm på nätet, som har förstärkts i varje led. Det sprids på Facebook, Flashback och olika obskyra forum och det kommer en hel del skit, hot och förtal om mig”, säger Robert Aschberg till DN. Foto: TT, bilden till höger är en genrebild. Ett dödsfall i radikalnationalistiska kretsar är bakgrunden till en våg av antisemitiska konspirationsteorier på nätet. Grovt hat och hot riktas nu mot journalisten Robert Aschberg, som tar hjälp av en advokat.          Natten mot den 15 december hittades en förgrundsgestalt inom den svenska radikalnationalismen avliden. Mannen, som var i 30-årsåldern, har kallat sig för medborgarjournalist och skaffat en bred följarskara bland annat genom strategin att göra hembesök hos journalister och publicister.Polisen har bekräftat dödsfallet och uppgett att det inte finns någonting som tyder på brott. Men i sociala medier och alternativmedier, både i Sverige och internationellt, har ryktesspridningen varit långtgående: dödsfallet har legat till grund för en våg av konspirationsteorier, grov antisemitism och grundlösa brottsanklagelser.– Det är väldigt mycket folk som kontaktar polisen i den här frågan, säger Tommy Lindén, chef på utredningssektionen vid Polisen i nordvästra Skåne.– Det finns absolut ingenting som tyder på att det här skulle vara något brott över huvud taget. Det finns inte ens några antydningar om det. Det här är en tragisk händelse och jag hade varit jättetacksam om ni kan dementera alla rykten. Mitt i stormen står journalisten Robert Aschberg. Han var den som mannen, tillsammans med fotograf, gjorde sitt sista hembesök hos, eftermiddagen den 30 november. Robert Aschberg var inte hemma vid tillfället utan befann sig ombord på ett flygplan, på väg tillbaka till Stockholm efter en reportageresa i Kiruna.Ett filmklipp, som publicerades drygt en vecka senare på flera sociala plattformar, innehöll en rad anklagelser och påståenden om Robert Aschberg. Mannen antydde senare att han skulle återkomma med fler uppgifter men dagarna därpå påträffades han avliden.Mannens popularitet har varit bred i radikalnationalistiska och högerextrema kretsar. I flera städer anordnades offentliga minnesstunder efter hans bortgång. DN har genom mejl varit i kontakt med den grupp som mannen varit drivande inom och som offentliggjorde att han gått bort, men den som svarar på mejl uppger att man inte vill ställa upp på en telefonintervju. Via gruppen har mannens anhöriga gjort ett kort uttalande där man ber människor att respektera deras sorg: ”Jag förstår att min brors död har fött många tankar och känslor. Vi har tyvärr inga svar just nu”‚ skriver mannens bror och tillägger: ”Varje gång någon nämner tankar kring mord eller andra teorier så påverkar det oss något enormt”. DN har varit i kontakt med familjen som uppger att de inte vill lämna en kommentar.Snabbt efter beskedet att mannen avlidit började grundlösa anklagelser mot Robert Aschberg florera i sociala medier, alternativmedier och på internetforum. Många inlägg har varit grovt antisemitiska, och ett av huvudspåren är påståenden om att Aschberg samarbetat med ”judiska kontakter”, finansmannen George Soros eller den israeliska säkerhetstjänsten Mossad för att mörda mannen, något som Medievärlden tidigare rapporterat.– Det har blivit en skitstorm på nätet, som har förstärkts i varje led. Det sprids på Facebook, Flashback och olika obskyra forum och det kommer en hel del skit, hot och förtal om mig, säger Robert Aschberg till DN. – Jag är ganska van vid sådant här och går inte direkt i däck. I januari ska jag sätta mig i lugn och ro och titta igenom allt. Det är insamlat och jag ska tala med en mycket bra advokat. Men det är inte bråttom.Robert Aschberg vill samtidigt tona ned betydelsen av ryktesspridningen. Han tror att bara en liten minoritet tar till sig av de konspirationsteorier som sprids, och menar att reaktionerna i sig bidrar till att öka motsättningarna inom radikalnationalistiska och högerextrema rörelser.– Det här är rena snurrigheter och stolligheter och de som är lite smartare får svårare att komma ut med sitt budskap. Det finns till och med dem i de här kretsarna som ringt mig och bett om råd, vilket jag inte kan bidra med, säger Robert Aschberg.Förutom Medievärlden har också Resumé och Aftonbladet rapporterat om de reaktioner som dödsfallet har gett upphov till. En splittrad högerextrem och radikalnationalistisk miljö har i efterdyningarna av dödsfallet förenats i att sprida antisemitiska konspirationsteorier, menar Mathias Ståhle, reporter på Eskilstuna-Kuriren, som det senaste året granskat flera främlingsfientliga propagandacentraler. – Av dödsfallet har man inom olika kluster av trollfabriker kokat ihop en historia som är ren och skär antisemitism. Man har samtidigt lyckats få gensvar för detta på ett sätt som jag inte har sett förut, säger Mathias Ståhle till DN.Budskapet är inte utformat av en enstaka källa, menar Ståhle, utan i teoretiserandet kring dödsfallet har flera olika propagandacentraler riktat sitt fokus mot samma mål – och till skillnad från tidigare kampanjer har spridandet av konspirationen omedelbart eskalerat.– Tidigare har budskap behövt ligga och gro under en tid. Det här kan bero på en effektiv organisering eller bara tur, men man verkar ha lärt sig hur spridningen fungerar. Det är lite oroväckande eftersom det inte brukar vara möjligt att skapa med normal internetdynamik, säger Mathias Ståhle.Henrik Johansson, som driver antirasistiska bloggen ”Inte rasist, men” och är ledarkrönikör i Dalarnas Tidningar, berättar att mannen som avlidit rört sig i gränslandet mellan flera högerextrema och radikalnationalistiska grupper, något som också bidragit till de starka reaktionerna på hans bortgång. Han skrev tidigare i veckan i DT att dödsfallet ”tänt en gnista av sällan skådat slag”.– Vi har aldrig sett en mer omfattande kampanj av antisemitism i Sverige. Allt det här kommer att finnas kvar och jag är väldigt orolig för vilka konsekvenser det kan få, säger Henrik Johansson till DN.Flera filmklipp och forumtrådar där teorier kring händelsen diskuteras och anklagelser förs fram har i nuläget visats över hundratusen gånger. Vid sidan av huvudspåren i konspirationsteorierna uppger Henrik Johansson att han lagt märke till diskussioner om möjliga hämndaktioner.– Lögnerna sprids veckan efter att vi haft en stor diskussion om antisemitism i Sverige, som en följd av händelserna i Malmö och Göteborg. Man måste förstå hur allvarligt det är när flera tusen människor på internet sprider konspirationer där judar pekas ut som människor med mord i sinnet, säger Henrik Johansson.– Jag tycker att många gör misstaget att förminska det här genom att titta på hans gärning, i stället för se på det samlade eftermälet. Man måste ta myten kring detta på allvar, eftersom kraften i det som händer nu är betydligt större än vad många tror.Inom kort stundar inledningen på valåret 2018 i Sverige, något flera bedömare på förhand har varnat för kan leda till att mängden och kraften i propaganda, falska nyheter och konspirationsteorier ökar. Mattias Ekman, docent i medie- och kommunikationsvetenskap vid Örebro universitet som forskat kring högerextrem och högerpopulistisk politisk kommunikation, menar att konspiratoriska föreställningar hänger ihop med en stark misstro mot ett utpekat etablissemang.– De hänger samtidigt ihop med antisemitism, rasism och antifeministiska föreställningar som florerar i sociala medier. Tankefigurerna hakar i, gynnar varandra och tillgängliggör en viss sorts verklighetsuppfattning, ofta samtidigt som misstron mot etablerade samhällsinstitutioner och massmedier förstärks i dessa miljöer, säger Mattias Ekman.Mathias Ståhle ser risker med att diskussionen om trollfabriker och de konspirationer som sprids kommer att stjäla allt större syre.– När du, jag och alla andra väljare vill diskutera vård, skola, omsorg eller försvarsbudgeten så kommer de här krafterna att försöka se till att vi i stället sitter och diskuterar något annat. Men när det går så här långt kan vi inte ignorera det. Vi måste lära oss att se hur det här fungerar, säger Ståhle och avslutar:– Mitt i den här stormen finns också en familj och anhöriga som nu sörjer en närstående som har gått bort. Jag måste säga att det är förkastligt att händelsen samtidigt används för helt andra syften i en trollkampanj. Alla människor har rätt att få sörja. Det handlar om vanligt hyfs och respekt.Ämnen i den här artikeln:Antisemitismen i Sverige

Du följer nu :  (sparas i Mitt DN)H&M kan komma att anlita kritiserade Alexander Bard i ny satsningKlädjätten H&M har diskuterat ett samarbete med artisten och debattören Alexander Bard. Bard har fått stark kritik för att han avfärdat Metoo-rörelsen som förtal av män.         Det är i samband med H&M:s nya e-handelssatsning som Alexander Bard har kontaktats för att nå en ung kundkrets som vuxit upp kring millennieskiftet, skriver sajterna The Cut och Breakit. Satsningen ska nå den grupp som kallas för ”millennials” och detta genom ett nytt varumärke, Nyden.– Nydengruppen har pratat med Alexander Bard men det finns inget formellt samarbete mellan Bard och H&M, säger företagets pressansvariga Katarina Kempe.Alexander Bard har kritiserats hårt för sina uttalanden om Metoo-rörelsen som han bland annat menar ägnar sig åt ”pöbelangrepp på oskyldiga män” eftersom han anser att rörelsen förändrats från en ”fin och jättebra kampanj” för att sedan ”fullkomligt urartat”, skriver Metro.Den 22 oktober skrev Bard att hela kampanjen bygger på att ”150 miljoner neurotiska kvinnor läst ’Fifty shades of grey’.”Bard har också kallat popstjärnan Zara Larsson för ”manshatare” och ”kändisbitch” på Twitter. Zara Larsson har svarat med att kalla Bard för ”dum” och säger i en podcast att det hela är ”jättesorgligt”, skriver Expressen.Så sent som i onsdags skrev Bard i sitt Twitterflöde att kvinnor är ”för barnsliga för att leva efter lagen, till skillnad från män”.Nu har alltså Alexander Bard kontakts av H&M:s Nydem-grupp i en diskussion kring företagets nysatsning. Men vilken roll han skulle få där är oklart.Enligt Bard själv så har han ”inspirerat” Nydem-gruppen och säger sig vara stolt över det. Enligt Katarina Kempe finns det ingen koppling mellan H&M och Bard:– Vi har aldrig sagt att han har en roll och det finns inget formellt samarbete med H&M, men Nydem-teamet har pratat med honom.Enligt The Cut ska Bard fungera som ett slags ”husfilosof” åt H&M.Ämnen i den här artikeln:Twitter    Hennes & Mauritz    Zara Larsson    Så här jobbar DN med kvalitetsjournalistik: uppgifter som publiceras ska vara sanna och relevanta.

1574,1,,"Acaba de ser lançado um relatório de quase 2 mil páginas com informações novas sobre como a ditadura militar agiu em Minas Gerais. O documento é resultado de quatro anos de pesquisas e entrevistas realizadas pela Comissão da Verdade de Minas Gerais (Covemg), com o objetivo de recuperar fatos que aconteceram entre os anos de 1946 a 1988.

Em primeiro lugar, um destaque às 1.531 pessoas que foram presas no estado. A secretária executiva da Covemg, Helena Amorim, informa que este é o primeiro levantamento feito na história mineira e demonstra que os motivos das mortes não foram apenas por ideologia política, como popularmente se acredita. Nas prisões, geralmente ilegais, houve camponeses, indígenas e trabalhadores urbanos. “Pessoas que lutavam por sua sobrevivência”, diz Helena.

Muitos números também são inéditos. Foram 17 militantes mortos, 49 mineiros mortos fora do estado, 109 camponeses assassinados, 3109 trabalhadores urbanos reprimidos e incontáveis indígenas perseguidos. As mortes aconteciam pelas mãos de órgãos do governo, das Forças Armadas, das Polícias ou através de assassinatos diretos que tinham a conivência da ditadura, como afirma Helena Amorim.

Foram identificados 125 agentes públicos mineiros denunciados por tortura. O mais citado, e provavelmente com a maior lista de crueldades em seu currículo, é o capitão do Exército Hilton de Paula Portella. Ele é citado 80 vezes.

Ao lado dele, os torturadores mais denunciados foram o delegado Thacir Omar Menezes Sai, citado 69 vezes, o coronel aposentado Pedro Ivo dos Santos Vasconcelos, citado 68 vezes, o ex-empresário e ex-militar Marcelo Paixão de Araújo, citado 66 vezes, e o ex-sargento da PM Leo Machado, citado 62 vezes.

Brasil é um dos últimos países a recuperar a verdade

A repressão não aconteceu só no Brasil. Entre os anos de 1954 e 1990, 13 países da América Latina enfrentaram ditaduras militares, o que significa que 64% da população latino-americana estava sob governos autoritários. Segundo o relatório, isso não é uma coincidência, visto que existiam órgãos estrangeiros influenciando as decisões desses países.

A maioria dos países instalaram suas comissões da verdade com a função de investigar, condenar e punir, diferente do caso brasileiro. Aqui, de acordo com o coordenador da Covemg, Robson Sávio, as comissões tiveram autorização apenas para investigar. O relatório de Minas Gerais inovou e cada subcomissão listou suas recomendações práticas aos poderes Executivo, Legislativo e Judiciário.

Algumas das recomendações são a abertura de CPIs, investigações sobre violência policial, sobre a prática de alguns juízes e a divulgação de dados que permaneceram fechados à comissão. Indica ainda a revisão da Lei da Anistia (nº 6.683), a reparação às famílias das vítimas e às vítimas, e punição aos torturadores. Robson destaca também a importância da continuação das pesquisas, pois muitos fatos não puderam ser devidamente apurados.

“O que se tinha antes era uma história circunscrita a Belo Horizonte. Avançamos bastante em relação à história de camponeses e etnias indígenas. Conseguimos apontar que uma série de agentes privados (empresas) colaboraram com a ditadura. Mostramos que o regime militar era muito mais complexo”, analisa Robson Sávio.

Em 13 de dezembro, o relatório foi apresentado à Assembleia Legislativa de Minas Gerais e ao governador Fernando Pimentel (PT), de quem Robson espera medidas efetivas no “comprometimento com a verdade e a memória”, inclusive do Tribunal de Justiça de Minas Gerais, ausente na solenidade de entrega. A Covemg teve trabalho estendido até 8 de fevereiro de 2018.

O que foi a ditadura militar?

Período de 20 anos (1964 a 1984) em que o Brasil foi governado por militares. As eleições para presidente foram canceladas e os políticos eram indicados pelos militares, por isso o nome de “ditadura”. Meios de comunicação eram proibidos de dar notícias contra o governo e pessoas que criticavam essa política eram presas, torturadas ou mortas.

O documento mostra a relação da ditadura com 12 temas: mortes e desaparecimentos, tortura, locais de repressão e tortura, ditadura no campo, repressão aos trabalhadores urbanos e movimento sindical, Igrejas cristãs, povos indígenas, terrorismo praticado pela extrema direita, censura aos meios de comunicação, repressão aos estudantes e o impedimento de crianças viverem com seus pais. Os cinco volumes do relatório estão disponíveis em www.comissaodaverdade.mg.gov.br.

Em janeiro de 2018 o Brasil de Fato publica mais matérias com informações do relatório da Comissão da Verdade de Minas Gerais. Leia parte das informações que integram a primeira matéria, sobre os indígenas:

“Na margem esquerda do Rio Doce funciona agora um posto indígena da FUNAI. Lá dentro, dois cabos da PM e cinco soldados tomam conta do velho Jacó e da velha Sebastiana e de mais 50 índios de todo Brasil, considerados rebeldes. Para o velho Jacó e a velha Sebastiana, não há mais esperanças: só sairão de lá mortos. […] O significado exato da palavra ‘rebelde’, aplicado aos índios, até agora ninguém entendeu”.

1575,1,,"O prefeito de São Paulo, João Doria Jr. em seus onze meses de governo anunciou inúmeras doações da iniciativa privada para a prefeitura. Motos da Yamaha, pistolas Glocks para a Guarda Civil Metropolitana, suporte informático da Cisco, cimento da Votorantim, são alguns exemplos desta prática.

As doações são apresentadas pela equipe de Doria como saída para a falta de recurso da prefeitura. Porém, até o momento, a gestão só recebeu 8% dos R$ 626 milhões prometidos como doações, segundo dados da própria prefeitura.

As críticas pela falta de transparência fizeram com que a gestão mudasse de postura. É o que conta a advogada Aline Gonçalves de Sousa, pesquisadora da Fundação Getúlio Vargas. ""Foi organizado no Portal transparência [Portal de Dados Abertos], uma sessão específica para tratar das doações, comandados e termos de cooperação da prefeitura. A questão é que ainda está frágil essa ferramenta"", afirma.

A advogada se refere à maneira em que os dados estão sendo divulgados. Numa grande tabela, a prefeitura inclui todas as negociações das doações. Há muitos campos incompletos, como o valor do contrato, o material/serviço que seria doado, entre outros.

Em julho, um grande polêmica envolveu doações de remédios para a prefeitura com validade muito próxima ao vencimento e pela isenção do Imposto sobre Operações relativas à Circulação de Mercadorias (ICMS), graças à parceria com o governador do estado, Geraldo Alckimin (PSDB).

Na época, o vereador Toninho Vespoli (PSOL-SP) entrou com representação via Ministério Público (MP) por já encontrar incongruências no processo de doação. ""Um elemento é que o Doria mente. Nem tudo o que ele fala que recebe você vê depois no Diário Oficial"", denuncia.

Gonçalves, que também acredita que esse tipo de confusão que gera insegurança ocorre porque as doações privadas são anunciadas antes da efetivação do trâmite administrativo e jurídico dentro da Prefeitura e publicação no Diário Oficial.

Também para rebater as críticas, em junho foi criada a Secretaria Especial de Investimento Social e dentro dela uma comissão para processar as doações da prefeitura. Segundo o Portal de Dados, a gestão recebeu cerca de 303 contribuições de empresas e os R$ 626 milhões anunciados ficaram bem distantes. Vespoli não acredita nesses números. ""Ele tem que inflar as doações para justificar uma secretaria de doações"", opina.

Sobre os remédios, uma reportagem da CBN de novembro revelou que a prefeitura teve que arcar com os custos de incineração dos medicamentos que venceram, tendo gasto cerca de R$ 60 mil.

Todas as empresas que doaram os produtos à prefeitura receberam isenção fiscal e se livraram dos custos do descarte. Embora tenha arquivado o pedido do Vespoli, o MP continua investigando a isenção cedida por Alckimin.

Na época, a prefeitura por meio da sua assessoria de imprensa afirmou que a melhora no abastecimento nas farmácias foi possível graças a doações recebidas emergencialmente de laboratórios farmacêuticos.

Para Gonçalves, a descentralização dos processos de doação ajudam a não ter uma padrão de prestação de contas para as doações. ""A legislação do município diz que a competência para receber doações privadas é de cada secretaria e sub-prefeitura, ou seja, há uma grande descentralização sobre quem decide se pode ou não receber alguma doação"", explica.

A advogada especialista acredita que para além da transparência, é necessário avaliar os desdobramentos de doações privadas numa cidade como São Paulo. ""Essa análise mais cuidadosa do mercado e os efeitos de uma doação precisa ser bem analisada, só quando houver esse olhar é que junto à transparência vai ser possível garantir o interesse público daquela relação privada"", considera.

Ela alerta que ao longo prazo, a prática de doações pode acabar criando reservas de mercado e beneficiar muito mais as empresas do que a população.

1576,1,,"Na segunda-feira (18), moradores de comunidades do município de Barcarena foram às ruas para protestar contra os danos ambientais causados pela mineradora Hydro. Desde quinta-feira passada (14), os moradores têm bloqueado rodovias que dão acesso às fábricas da multinacional.

De acordo com Fabiano Pereira do Movimento Livre dos Trabalhadores de Barcarena (MLTB), um grupo ocupou a frente da Prefeitura Municipal, impedindo o acesso dos funcionários ao prédio. Em outro ponto da cidade um segundo grupo de manifestantes bloquearam as portarias das empresas Albras e Alunorte para que os funcionários não entrassem; logo depois os moradores interditaram a Rodovia Transaluminio, que dá acesso a elas e ao porto da Companhia das Docas do Pará (CDP).

A manifestação repercutiu, e chegou à Noruega, já que o estado norueguês possui a maior parte das ações (34,3%) da Hydro. O jornal norueguês Dagens Næringsliv (Negócios de Hoje) noticiou em sua edição de domingo (17), a manifestação que ocorreu na semana passada.

José Araújo, da Comissão de Ética e Cidadania de Barcarena, afirma que os moradores das comunidades de Burajuba, Bom Futuro, Jardim Cabano I e II, Fazedinha, Itupanema, Água Verde, Novo Horizonte, Pedral, Tauá, Japiim, São Sebastião e Santa Rosa, são diretamente afetadas pelos crimes ambientais da Hydro e que as famílias querem ser ressarcidas pelos danos ambientais.

“São pessoas de baixa renda e de uma hora para outra alguém vem e joga no chão e diz que aquilo [terra] lá é da empresa, então eles estão querendo uma reparação por danos financeiros e por dano ambiental, principalmente a saúde deles, a saúde da maioria é abalada”, afirmou Araújo.

A cidade faz parte das manchetes dos jornais locais que denunciam os crimes ambientais de vazamentos de rejeitos das indústrias. O Laboratório de Química Analítica e Ambiental (Laquanam) da Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA) apresentou um estudo em 2014 que apontou que a água consumida pela população local apresentava contaminação com elementos tóxicos, como chumbo, alumínio, cádmio e bário, em médias acima do permitido pelo Ministério da Saúde.

Em 2016, o Ministério Público Federal (MPF) e Ministério Público do Pará (MPPA) entraram na justiça contra o estado paraense e o município de Barcarena, exigindo fornecimento de água limpa para a população.

A chegada desde a década de 1980 de projetos industriais, portuários e logísticos, como a instalação das indústrias de alumina e alumínio da Albras e Alunorte, vem ocasionando deslocamento de famílias. A Hydro é a principal acionista das duas empresas. Segundo dados do boletim informativo Barcarena Livre Informa, elaborado por moradores, lideranças de movimentos populares e pesquisadores, entre os anos de 1979 a 2015 cerca de 10 mil pessoas foram retiradas dos locais onde viviam para dá lugar ao aos projetos.

Em nota, a empresa afirmou que tem acompanhado as manifestações e respeita a livre manifestação, e que está aberta ao diálogo. A empresa afirma ainda que “100% dos seus resíduos industriais são tratados e não são lançados nos rios da região”, e diz reconhecer que operação industrial gera impactos, mas a empresa segue “padrões rígidos de controle, monitoramento e prevenção para garantir uma operação sustentável respeitando as comunidades e o meio ambiente”.

1577,1,,"A professora de direitos humanos da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (URFJ), Carol Proner, organizadora de uma coletânea de artigos que analisam a sentença do caso do tríplex, veio especialmente a Porto Alegre (RS) para acompanhar as manifestações sociais contra as arbitrariedades no julgamento de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, que tramita no Tribunal Regional Federal (TRF) da 4ª Região, na capital gaúcha.

Ela considera que independentemente do resultado do julgamento marcado para o dia 24 de janeiro, o ex-presidente será vitorioso. Em entrevista à Radioagência Brasil de Fato, a jurista observou ainda que o crescente apoio ao ex-presidente reflete a consciência popular a respeito de um processo jurídico “flagrantemente injusto”. Em sua opinião, há inclusive a possibilidade de não haver perseguição política no TRF4 e no TSE.

Brasil de Fato – Qual a sua perspectiva a respeito dos resultados de 24 de janeiro?

Carol Proner: O julgamento do TRF 4 é jurídico e pode gerar uma condenação em segunda instância que ainda estará sujeita a grau recursal. Podem ser embargos de declaração e embargos infringentes, e ainda cabe recurso no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). Uma coisa é o caso do triplex, que é o caso que está sendo julgado e que está mais avançado entre os vários processos contra o presidente Lula, e poderá, no primeiro semestre, alcançar uma condenação que pode gerar o pedido de impugnação a partir do registro da candidatura. A partir de 15 de agosto, o rito perante o Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) é autônomo é próprio. Decorridos 5 dias do registro de candidatura, pode ser solicitada a impugnação. Mas há muitas possibilidades, como a dos partidos substituírem a candidatura 20 dias após o pleito. Significa que no dia 15 de agosto e 16 de setembro poderia haver substituição do pleito e Lula poderia participar dos programas eleitorais, caso fique evidente que a celeridade da Justiça é para impedi-lo de concorrer às eleições. Muitas coisas podem acontecer. Se há perseguição política no Judiciário, não necessariamente acontecerá no TRF 4, e não sabemos se acontecerá no TSE.

O PT afirma em documento divulgado na semana passada que 2017 é um marco na retomada de iniciativas políticas democráticas, e que a candidatura Lula deixou de ser apenas petista. Como a sra analisa isso?

A candidatura do presidente Lula pertence ao povo brasileiro. É importante separar o julgamento no TRF e a eventual condenação e impugnação de uma candidatura que apenas seria possível quando ele passar a ser candidato, o que vai acontecer em 15 de agosto quando haverá o registro da candidatura. Mas não importa o que aconteça, o PT acredita em sua inocência, e ele continuará sendo candidato. Esse anúncio de antecipação no julgamento pelo TRF 4 fará com que forças políticas façam uma avaliação sobre os rumos da política eleitoral de 2018. Será possível a consolidação de amplos apoios não apenas por Lula ser o maior líder político do Brasil e pelos méritos de sua biografia, mas ele tem contra si um processo flagrantemente injusto que por si só já provocaria a união dos setores progressistas. Lula ocupará o protagonismo absoluto seja ele condenado ou não. Essa é uma realidade que o TRF 4 não poderá evitar, e que o sr. Sérgio Moro não poderá evitar.

A senhora poderia fazer um resumo didático sobre todo esse processo?

A sentença do chamado caso tríplex gerou muita perplexidade no mundo jurídico. É um caso realmente único, em todos os aspectos. As audiências, as provas geradas consideradas ilícitas, a detenção do ex-presidente Lula na chamada condução coercitiva por seis horas sem justificativa e amparo legal, as escutas ilegais relacionadas aos advogados e a conversa do ex-presidente Lula com a então presidente Dilma Rousseff, a negativa de destruição dessas escutas, inclusive do escritório de advocacia que defende o presidente e dos 25 a 30 advogados que ali trabalham. Se fosse um juízo justo, geraria nulidade processual. Fora isso, notamos nas 238 laudas da sentença que quase 20%  são dedicados à defesa, por parte do juiz da causa, do uso de um direito excepcional. Em vez de fundamentar as medidas e o porquê da condenação sem provas, Sergio Moro se dedicou a explicar porque é importante expandir o direito, a capacidade de punição, a capacidade investigatória. São vários os abusos do magistrado, como condução de audiências com evidente pré-julgamento, publicidade seletiva para a mídia, muitas vezes antes mesmo do conhecimento dos advogados de defesa. Também a negativa de acesso a documentos do processo, negação de ouvir testemunhas para a construção de provas, violações de princípios básicos de defesa, além de delações premiadas também escandalosas.

Com todos esses absurdos jurídicos, e sem que a Justiça brasileira tome providências, há possibilidade de se apelar a cortes internacionais?

Uma sensação é comum aos professores e conhecedores de direito de outros países que acompanham tanto o impeachment da presidente Dilma Rousseff, quanto o julgamento contra o ex-presidente Lula. É um escândalo absurdo não compreendido. Diante de tanta arbitrariedade do sistema de Justiça, os advogados do ex-presidente Lula já estão recorrendo a cortes internacionais, principalmente o comitê de direitos civis e políticos das Nações Unidas que acompanham esses casos. Sem dúvida mancha a imagem do país. É muito desagradável para quem trabalha no direito ter que chegar ao ponto de responsabilizar setores da Justiça, tentar explicar que o Judiciário pode estar equivocado ou inclusive participando de uma trama que envolve amplamente a crise institucional e politica que atinge o nosso país de forma tão brutal. Não é agradável para quem respeita a democracia, as instituições e o estado de direito. Estamos vivendo uma sentença que é apenas uma peça dessa arquitetura toda que tenta tirar um candidato forte das eleições, que poderia barrar o desmonte constitucional e econômico do país. Isso tem ficado cada vez mais evidente.

1578,1,,"O ano que está prestes a terminar teve mais derrotas do que vitórias para os operadores da Lava Jato.

Em janeiro, ficou claro que Michel Temer (PMDB) estava disposto a “estancar a sangria”. Após a morte do relator da Lava Jato no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), Teori Zavascki, o presidente golpista indicou Alexandre de Moraes para a Corte. Moraes era ministro da Justiça, e precisou se desfiliar do PSDB para assumir o cargo.

Temer também mudou o comando da Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR) e da Polícia Federal (PF). Em nenhum dos casos, escolheu o profissional mais votado pelos colegas. Pelo contrário, colocou dois nomes de sua confiança: Fernando Segóvia, na Polícia Federal, e Raquel Dodge, na PGR. Para completar, o golpista distribuiu emendas bilionárias no Congresso Nacional e conseguiu barrar duas denúncias que poderiam derrubá-lo.

No segundo semestre do ano, o resultado desastroso da operação Ouvidos Moucos chamou a atenção para o risco das violações popularizadas pela República de Curitiba. Luiz Carlos Cancellier, reitor da Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, se suicidou após a prisão arbitrária ordenada por uma ex-delegada da Lava Jato, Érika Marena.

Em seguida, explodiu a “bomba” de Tacla Durán: o ex-advogado da Odebrecht que acusou Carlos Zucolotto Jr., amigo pessoal do juiz Sérgio Moro, de cobrar propina para negociar acordos de delação.

De nada adiantou o lançamento de um filme sobre a Lava Jato, nem o apoio diário da mídia comercial. A ofensiva contra o ex-presidente Lula e os sinais cada vez mais evidentes de partidarização da operação custaram caro. Nas duas passagens do petista por Curitiba, para prestar depoimento, os gritos de ódio foram abafados por manifestações de solidariedade.

Condenado por Moro sem provas no “caso triplex”, Lula termina o ano como favorito para as eleições presidenciais, e com julgamento em segunda instância marcado para o dia  24 de janeiro em Porto Alegre.

A queda de braço continua em 2018, e é cada vez mais difícil estabelecer previsões. O que não se pode negar é que, para bem ou para mal, a Lava Jato respira por aparelhos.

O Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST), a Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT), a Central dos trabalhadores e trabalhadoras do Brasil (CTB), a Via Campesina e outros movimentos populares estão se articulando para marcar a data das diferentes mobilizações.

1580,1,,"A história brasileira é marcada por vários episódios de luta popular em defesa de direitos, que garantem dignidade, respeito e, acima disso, a vida. É neste contexto, que o povo negro, vítima da diáspora que os retirou do seu continente de origem - África -, conduziu o enfrentamento cotidiano na defesa de todas as dimensões sociais e culturais que reafirmam o lugar de protagonismo na construção de uma identidade e representatividade social.

Na Bahia, estado brasileiro cuja população é majoritariamente composta por negros e negras, a professora Railma Souza explica que a resistência passa, em primeiro lugar, pelo enfrentamento à visão eurocêntrica. “Infelizmente, ainda enchemos a boca para dizer que pessoas cultas são as que ouvem alguns tipos de música, leem muitos livros […] o que constitui uma hierarquização da cultura”, pontua.

Nesse sentido, Railma considera fundamental romper com essas noções estereotipadas e tentar compreender a complexidade das expressões da cultura do povo negro, do povo indígena, rural, periférico. “Enxergar a poesia de rua como poesia, o reggae, o rap, o hip hop, o funk e mesmo o pagode enquanto estilos musicais”, explica.

Ao compreender essas questões, a yalorixá Jaciará Ribeiro, afirma que o racismo tem matado homens, mulheres, jovens e o processo de organização e valorização do candomblé, enquanto um instrumento de resistência e reafirmação de uma identidade de luta, tem trabalhado no resgate da autoestima, no acolhimento de famílias, jovens e mulheres. “Somente com os terreiros de candomblé, quilombolas e de resistência, que teremos o compasso para continuarmos lutando”, reflete Jaciará.

Um exemplo desse processo de resistência e do papel histórico que as lutas antirracistas possuem, os afoxés, têm protagonismo por serem uma manifestação artístico-religiosa vinculada às práticas do candomblé. Segundo o projeto Afreaka, essa foi a primeira manifestação negra a desfilar pelas ruas da Bahia, em 1885. Dentre os afoxés mais tradicionais baianos estão o Filhos de Gandhy, em Salvador, e o Filhos da Luz, em Feira de Santana.

Importante destacar também a capoeira, originada no século XVII, desenvolveu-se como uma estratégia dos povos africanos escravizados para cultivarem a sociabilidade e lidarem com a violência do período escravista, presente em todo o território nacional e em mais de 160 países, segundo o Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional (IPHAN); e o Samba de Roda do Recôncavo Baiano, que é reconhecido pela Organização das Nações Unidas para a Educação, a Ciência e a Cultura (UNESCO) como Patrimônio Cultural Imaterial da Humanidade, por ser uma das expressões musicais, coreográficas, poéticas e festivas mais importantes de nossa cultura.

Uma festa que mobiliza multidões de todo estado é a “Boa Morte”, que é organizada pela Irmandade da Nossa Senhora da Boa Morte, confraria que reúne apenas mulheres negras e que surgiu nas primeiras décadas do século XIX, em Salvador, e depois migrou para Cachoeira, no Recôncavo.

Ao problematizar o papel político dessas manifestações artísticas, Ivannide Santa Bárbara, do Movimento Negro Unificado (MNU), destaca que o racismo promove uma “folclorização” da cultura negra: “os racistas nos veem como pessoas folclorizadas, fantasiadas mesmo. Viramos objeto de observação, como se fossemos vitrines, e não pessoas comuns que se assumiram como são dentro das suas origens”.

Neste contexto, Hely Pedreira, professora de escolas em áreas quilombola de Feira de Santana, fala sobre a Lei 10.639/03, que trata do ensino da História e Cultura Africana e Afro-brasileira nas escolas como uma conquista, ainda que tenha seus limites. Para ela, a cultura tem um importante papel na sala de aula. “Com certeza a questão cultural é um aliado de muito peso, pois traduz a questão identitária dos sujeitos e suas representações. Acredito que a valorização cultural pode ser a ponta de lança na efetivação de uma educação que emancipa e empodere os seus sujeitos”, afirma.

1581,1,,"A cena drag de Brasília ganhou, nessa terça-feira (19), uma purpurina a mais: o Calendário Drag 2018. O material foi produzido pelo coletivo Distrito Drag e busca dar visibilidade à causa, rompendo com a ideia de que a atuação das personagens se restringe a espaços sociais tradicionalmente marginalizados.

Segundo Maria Rojava, uma das organizadoras, ao confrontar o estereótipo difundido amplamente pela mídia tradicional e cristalizado no imaginário popular, a iniciativa fortalece a ideia de que o mundo drag vai além das aparências.

""Não é errado ir só pra TV ou ir só pra boate, mas é importante a gente ter uma visão do que está além disso"", diz.

A iniciativa, que é pioneira no Distrito Federal, contou com a colaboração de dez fotógrafos e 18 modelos drag. Ao longo de mais de dois meses de trabalho, eles produziram fotos relacionadas às diferentes temáticas, que vão desde a luta contra a Aids e pela consciência negra até o debate sobre a importância da água como recurso a ser preservado. Cada mês do ano é relacionado a um tema. Segundo a artista Ruth Venceremos, a ideia é inserir as drag queens nos diversos debates do cenário nacional.

""É pra gente se colocar como sujeitos políticos que estão aí também pra debater os temas da sociedade, pra se posicionar em relação a esses temas"", comenta.

Para o pesquisador Cleyton Feitosa, do Instituto de Ciência Política da Universidade de Brasília (UnB), a iniciativa é relevante para a própria comunidade drag e também para parte da sociedade que não está inserida nesse debate.

""É um momento em que a gente se encontra, se confraterniza; e, pra sociedade mais ampla, que não faz parte da população LGBT, também é interessante porque estabelece diálogo, pontes, que podem resultar em mais reconhecimento, em mais solidariedade"", analisa.

Tonhão Nunes, que vive a arte drag há cerca de um ano e meio, foi uma das convidadas para posar para o calendário. A artista conta que se sentiu lisonjeada diante da possibilidade de expor o trabalho para além dos palcos da cena brasiliense.

""É uma coisa incrível. A gente aparece pra quem quiser ver, representando nosso mês, nossa vida, nossa existência, nossa política"", comemora.

O Calendário Drag tem ainda um viés solidário: o dinheiro das vendas será doado à Casa Rosa, uma instituição de Brasília que acolhe membros da comunidade LGBT que são expulsos de casa. Os pontos de venda do material estão disponíveis na página do Distrito Drag no Facebook.

1582,1,,"Atualmente uma das grandes preocupações da população brasileira é o consumo de alimentos saudáveis e livres de agrotóxicos. A agroecologia se apresenta como uma alternativa, construída pelos povos e movimentos sociais do campo, ao sistema agroalimentar hegemônico capitalista, que tem como característica, além do uso dos venenos, o monopólio de todo sistema de produção, circulação e venda de alimentos.

Os números de experiências agroecológicas exitosas aumentam a cada dia, espalhadas por todo país. Uma delas é a Rede de Agroecologia dos Povos da Mata na Bahia, que no mês de novembro deste ano recebeu o prêmio de tecnologia social da Fundação Banco do Brasil.

A Rede é composta de quilombolas, indígenas e camponeses do extremo sul, baixo sul e semiárido baiano, articulados a partir do Organismo Participativo de Avaliação de Conformidade (OPAC), que possibilita a certificação de forma participativa dos produtos orgânicos e garante a interação de produção e venda direta ao consumidor, principalmente a partir das feiras agroecológicas. Dessa forma, elimina-se a figura do atravessador, personagem que tipifica a apropriação do trabalho dos povos do campo.

Esta forma de organização tem como objetivo promover o diálogo necessário entre campo e cidade. Além da garantia da qualidade do produto, o consumidor se torna consciente sobre o processo produtivo como um todo, dando visibilidade e valorização ao trabalhador e trabalhadora do campo, alertando para a necessidade da reforma agrária e da construção de novas relações sociais e com a natureza.

Para Luciano Ferreira, camponês, militante do CETA - Movimento dos Trabalhadores(as) Assentados(as) e Acampados(as)  e coordenador do Núcleo Pratigi da Rede, “a conquista do prêmio representou para os agricultores e agricultoras um reconhecimento importante para o fortalecimento da agroecologia e produção de alimentos na Bahia, entendendo que essa ferramenta do Sistema Participativo de Garantia, agora reconhecida como uma tecnologia social, garante as condições para que nós, camponesas e camponeses, possamos ter a certificação e assim comercializar os alimentos de forma direta com os consumidores”, explica.

Comunidade Dois Riachões: exemplo de área livre de agrotóxicos e transgênicos

Situada no município de Ibirapitanga no território do baixo sul da Bahia, a comunidade Dois Riachões é um pré-assentamento do CETA e abriga 40 famílias, que há 15 anos ocuparam a antiga fazenda onde havia cacau e gado, e hoje tem mais de 50 variedades de frutas e hortaliças.  Vinculada à Rede de Agroecologia Povos da Mata, a experiência da comunidade, na qual Luciano e sua esposa, Primaria Silva de Oliveira, vivem e produzem, foi escolhida para ser apresentada no vídeo da premiação. Veja aqui.

Mesmo sendo este exemplo inspirador de transição agroecológica, a população de Dois Riachões ainda luta para receber a posse da terra. “Esse prêmio também chama a atenção para a necessidade da realização da reforma agrária e das demarcações de terras indígenas e quilombolas no Brasil para que, junto com um conjunto de políticas públicas, possam garantir alimentos saudáveis para toda população”, conclui o militante.

1583,1,,"As eleições que definem o novo Parlamento da Catalunha ocorrem nesta quinta-feira (21), com início às 9h da manhã local (6h de Brasília) e com previsão de divulgação do resultado ao final do dia. A partir da decisão, será montado um novo governo (Generalitat), em meio à grande atenção internacional em torno das disputas por independência da região.

Atualmente, a Catalunha tem pouco mais que 7,5 milhões de habitantes e é a Comunidade Autônoma com maior Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) da Espanha – 223,6 bilhões de euros (em 2016) –, algo em torno de 19% do PIB espanhol. Seu território, situado no extremo Leste do país, fazendo fronteira com o Sul da França, é composto por quatro províncias.

Nas últimas semanas, essa região tem travado uma batalha, institucional e nas ruas, por separar-se da Espanha. Contudo, a luta independentista atravessa séculos. Ao longo do século XX ela ganhou desdobramentos dramáticos, como durante a Guerra Civil Espanhola (1936-1939). Mas, desde a reabertura política – no final da década de 1970 –, e mais recentemente, nos últimos dez anos, novos capítulos foram adicionados a este conflito. Foram três consultas à população em forma de plebiscito, todos eles favoráveis à criação de um estatuto autonômico, ou defendendo a própria independência.

O conflito polarizou-se ainda mais nos últimos meses, quando o atual governo catalão, dirigido por Carlos Puigdemont, do conservador e liberal PDeCAT (Partido Democrático da Catalunha), declarou independência, em 27 de outubro, cumprindo com a vontade de 90% dos eleitores que foram às urnas três semanas antes, no polêmico referendo de 1º de outubro.

A demora por parte do governo catalão, entre o referendo e a declaração de independência, fez com que o cenário, que já era de polarização, ganhasse a atenção mundial. De um lado os ""independentistas"". De outro, os autodenominados ""constitucionalistas"" (ou simplesmente ""espanholistas""). Esta demora, na avaliação de Puigdemont e do seu grupo político, baseou-se em um duplo aspecto.

O primeiro, era a busca de apoio internacional para a declaração de independência, e para a posterior construção de um novo Estado. Sua tática buscava o respaldo, principalmente da União Europeia (UE), respaldo este que não veio. Tão logo a polarização tomou as ruas nos dias posteriores ao referendo, a UE e a Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) declararam reconhecer apenas o governo espanhol, manifestação idêntica a de boa parte dos países ocidentais.

O segundo aspecto, decorrente do primeiro, foi que esta demora, ampliando as manifestações de rua no mês de outubro, acabou por gerar um ""esvaziamento"" da base empresarial em seu governo com posterior pressão por este mesmo setor na região. Nas semanas posteriores ao referendo, algumas empresas (primeiro as do setor bancário, depois as do setor de serviços) declararam que iriam retirar suas sedes da Catalunha, devido à ""instabilidade política"". Avaliando o caráter cada vez mais à esquerda daquelas manifestações, o empresariado local preferiu o certo ao duvidoso e passou a apoiar a pressão exercida pelo governo espanhol, através do primeiro-ministro Mariano Rajoy, do hoje maior partido no Parlamento Espanhol, PP (Partido Popular), também conservador.

Nesta longa espera, a direita espanhola valeu-se das redes sociais para convocar massivas manifestações nas ruas de Barcelona. E fez isso através de perfis vinculados aos dois principais partidos que representam institucionalmente esta direita: o próprio PP e o C’s (Ciudadanos), partido ultraliberal surgido recentemente, mas que assistiu um crescimento eleitoral muito grande na Catalunha nos últimos anos.

Essas manifestações chegaram a ultrapassar, em número de manifestantes, as também massivas manifestações independentistas, e tinham a cara das manifestações pelo impeachment de Dilma Roussef no Brasil, em 2016. Ou, em outras palavras, eram os ""coxinhas"" que saíram às ruas com as camisas da seleção da Espanha atrás de trios elétricos.

O bloco independentista é bastante amplo. Diferente dos ""espanholistas"", que são, em sua maioria, de direita, ao menos na Catalunha. Dentro da Generalitat, no dia da declaração final de independência (27 de outubro), das 135 cadeiras do Parlamento Catalão, 70 parlamentares votaram pelo ""sim"" (eram necessários apenas 68 votos a favor para que ela fosse aceita).

Entre os votos favoráveis, estavam os de integrantes do bloco ""Juntos pelo Sim"" (encabeçado pelo PDeCAT), da ERC (Esquerda Republicana, mais conhecida como ""Esquerra"") e das CUP (Candidaturas da Unidade Popular). Além destes, os independentes e integrantes do Catalunya en Comú (da prefeita de Barcelona, Ada Colau) acabaram por votar pela independência. Esta mudança,na reta final deveu-se também à forte truculência com que o governo espanhol tratou a questão nas semanas anteriores.

Violência essa que só viria a aumentar do dia 27 em diante, quando o governo acabou por prender praticamente todos os membros do primeiro escalão da Generalitat, baseando-se no polêmico e comentado artigo 155 da Constituição Espanhola. Este artigo suprime a autonomia das Comunidades Autônomas, passando o governo espanhol a controlar diretamente as instituições governamentais autonômicas. Vale destacar que este dispositivo não era utilizado desde os tempos do ditador espanhol Francisco Franco (1936-1975). Rajoy, saudoso, fez lembrar o conhecido ditador do passado.

Mas, além desta composição institucional, é necessário destacar, também, a base social por trás das manifestações, antes e depois do referendo. As CUP, a organização mais à esquerda dentro do parlamento catalão e que tem uma estrutura organizativa bastante horizontal, é um partido que surgiu há mais de vinte anos e havia hesitado, anteriormente, em participar das eleições em nível da comunidade autônoma.

No lugar, a aposta das CUP foi a de ocupar espaços nos governos municipais, pois acreditavam que estes eram locais ""legítimos"" de exercício do poder popular. Esta estratégia ficou conhecida como ""municipalismo"" e seus espaços de decisão são as assembleias de bairro.

Sob o lema de ""Socialismo, Independência e Feminismo: , esta organização convocou milhares de pessoas nas semanas posteriores ao referendo pelo sim à Independência. Depois da prisão dos membros da Generalitat, por mais que as CUP não tivessem nenhum membro entre eles (afinal de contas ela não participava deste governo, apenas o apoiava), convocou mobilizações e trancamentos de rua, além de impulsionar uma greve geral, que não foi à frente.

Campanha para o 21D (21 de Dezembro)

Nesta campanha, evidencia-se um posicionamento extremamente conservador que se apoia em uma narrativa que oscila entre o ódio e a desinformação por parte dos ""espanholistas"". Nela, a principal porta voz é a grande mídia empresarial. Neste campo, concorrem três partidos que, com pequenas diferenças ideológicas, estão fechados quanto ao principal tema da campanha: a unidade espanhola.

Além do PP e dos C’s, também integra o grupo espanholista o histórico partido social democrata, o PSOE (Partido Socialista Operário Espanhol). Na Catalunha, eles são o PSC (Partido Socialista da Catalunha). Pedro Sanchez, principal nome do PSOE nos últimos anos, mantém um discurso voltado às próximas eleições nacionais. Suas intervenções dirigem-se mais a uma opinião pública espanhola cada vez mais conservadora que ao problema em questão.

A campanha midiática, de natureza quase fascista, tem conseguido o desgaste da narrativa independentista. De acordo com as últimas pesquisas, todos os partidos independentistas, à exceção da Esquerra, parecem indicar uma redução no número de cadeiras no Parlamento.

Os C’s aparecem na frente com 23 a 25% das intenções de voto. Seguidos pela Esquerra, com 20 a 23%. O Juntos pela Catalunha (bloco encabeçado pelo PDeCAT, de Puigdemont ) aparece com 14 a 20% (variação muito grande, a depender da empresa que realizou a pesquisa). Na mesma faixa de intenções de voto, aparece o PSC (PSOE da Catalunha). E atrás deles, as CUP e o PP, empatados com 5 a 7% cada um.

Se este quadro se confirmar, nem os independentistas nem os espanholistas, sozinhos conseguirão atingir a almejada maioria parlamentar. Contudo, na última legislatura, antes da deposição do atual governo, os independentistas tinham a maioria de 72 cadeiras. Neste cenário o desempate pode ser alcançado pelo apoio do Catalunya em Comú-Podem, bloco catalão vinculado ao Podemos.

O Podemos, vale lembrar, é uma organização jovem surgida das manifestações de 2011, do emblemático 1M5, também conhecido como Movimento dos Indignados. Surgiu em uma onda de mobilizações populares, com uma forte crítica à globalização e aos estragos causados pela crise econômica manifestada em 2008. O Podemos manteve-se, desde então, como um partido de posicionamentos mais à esquerda. Naquela altura as principais expressões do movimento, bastante amplo e difuso, eram, além do 15M, na Espanha, o Syriza, na Grécia.

No tema da Catalunha, no entanto, o Podemos vem tentando se manter neutro, em uma posição que não desagrada parte de seu eleitorado no restante da Espanha, que se opõe à independência. Nesta polarizada conjuntura, terão uma excelente oportunidade para se reaproximar de um posicionamento à esquerda, abandonado nos últimos anos, onde as eleições ocuparam mais suas ações que a construção de um projeto de transformação para a Espanha. E essa reaproximação se daria em total coerência com um afastamento desta neutralidade, que é bastante funcional ao reacionarismo do PP e de boa parte da direita espanhola na questão em jogo.

Se os espanholistas vencerem as eleições será a confirmação de um golpe, que iniciou-se pelo Judiciário, com enorme participação da mídia empresarial, e poderá sacralizar-se com a legitimação do voto.

A repetição dos inúmeros golpes institucionais que temos assistido pelo mundo nos últimos anos pode não ter chegado ao fim. Ao contrário, parece que esta é uma tendência em aberto e que as esquerdas terão de analisar com mais atenção a partir de agora.

A forma como o capital e os seus agrupamentos de direita encontraram para derrubar governos eleitos, sem ter de passar pela violência de ditaduras abertas, parece argumentar mais em favor das tragédias que das farsas históricas. A novidade, desta vez, é que, se tiver sucesso, o golpe terá ocorrido em um país do centro da economia capitalista, e não em um país do Sul.

Entretanto, mais novidades podem acontecer no enredo desse país, ainda sem Estado, chamado Catalunha. Nele, todos os atores estão presentes, liberais e conservadores, trabalhadores e juventude, empresários, antes divididos e que, agora, parecem unir-se novamente, e uma palavra de ordem ainda com muita força: independência.

Depois dessas eleições, poderemos saber o final do enredo: se o impasse vai continuar, ou se a Catalunha, finalmente, começará uma nova etapa de construção da sua tão almejada independência. Ou se conheceremos mais um capítulo da tragédia. Ou, talvez, da farsa?

1584,1,,"Como a crise econômica impacta a vida da juventude?

19 de Dezembro de 2017 às 13:38

Cortar gastos em uma economia em crise só contribui para que a receita caia.

O Brasil vem enfrentando a maior crise econômica da sua história. A queda do Produto Interno Bruto por dois anos consecutivos impacta nossas vidas no que tange ao aumento do desemprego, queda dos investimentos, diminuição do rendimento médio das famílias, entre outras dimensões econômicas.

A política econômica adotada pela equipe do governo golpista de Michel Temer tem nos levado ladeira abaixo. O governo tem compreendido as causas da atual crise econômica como de crescimento exagerado do gasto público. Nessa perspectiva, o remédio do corte drástico da despesa primária, ou seja, de tudo o que é orçamento do governo que não vai para honrar as obrigações financeiras, é amargo e profundamente ineficiente, o que agrava ainda mais o quadro do paciente.

A atual crise brasileira tem a ver com a queda da receita. Cortar gastos em uma economia em crise só contribui para que a receita caia ainda mais! Em momento de crise – em que nem as famílias e nem as empresas tem condições de se endividar – apenas o Estado teria condições de fazer uma política “anticíclica” garantindo os níveis de renda interna, assim preservando empregos e investimento.

Neste cenário, os trabalhadores são os mais afetados. Dentro da classe trabalhadora – que não é homogênea – podemos afirmar seguramente que mulheres, negros e jovens ficam ainda mais vulneráveis às crises e às políticas de “austeridade”, como corte de gastos públicos e arrochos salariais. Nessa reflexão falaremos somente da juventude.

a) Uma das principais características das crises são o aumento expressivo do desemprego. Nesse contexto os jovens sempre são mais afetados. Atualmente a taxa de desemprego entre jovens de até 29 anos está em 28% (PNAD Contínua IBGE 2017). Isso quer dizer que a cada quatro jovens, um está desempregado;

b) Esse crescimento do desemprego entre a juventude não é explicado somente pela contração e fechamento de postos de trabalho. O percentual de jovens desempregados antes da crise era muito menor porque grande parte deles não estava procurando emprego. Ocorre que com a crise, aquela família que conseguia manter um filho estudando por mais tempo já não consegue mais - ou porque tem algum membro desempregado ou porque caiu muito a renda familiar. Assim, esse jovem começa a pressionar a taxa de desemprego, o que é ruim para a economia nacional, mas muito pior para aquele jovem que podia só estudar e assim concorrer com melhores condições a uma vaga nas universidades ou mesmo a um emprego melhor qualificado;

c) O rotatividade também é maior entre os jovens. Isso quer dizer que nós jovens somos os primeiros a sermos demitidos em momentos de aperto financeiro;

d) As políticas de cortes de gastos, a exemplo a Emenda Constitucional (EC) 95, impacta – sobretudo – as possibilidade de futuro dos jovens, na medida em que congela os gastos em educação, que é uma política que acompanha a juventude por quase todo seu desenvolvimento;

e) Além disso, cortes em outras políticas públicas que tendem a se intensificar em momentos de crise – a exemplo da extinção do Passe Livre para estudantes na cidade de São Paulo – prejudicam as formas de estudo e lazer, principalmente da juventude das periferias.

Esses são apenas alguns exemplos que ajudam a compreender que as crises econômicas e suas políticas neoliberais de resolução no curto prazo, tem impactos sociais permanentes, contribuindo para frustrar um dos principais sonhos da juventude, que expressa-se na perspectiva de um futuro melhor.

Se esses problemas são coletivos, restam-nos saídas também coletivas, que passam pela organização social dos jovens e a defesa de um outro projeto de nação!

1585,1,,"A jovem palestina Ahed Tamimi, hoje com 17 anos, foi presa na última terça-feira (19) pelas forças israelenses - segundo o pai da jovem, sem um motivo oficial. Em 2012, aos 13 anos, ela foi personagem de uma reportagem de Opera Mundi, quando apareceu desafiando, de punho em riste, um soldado de Israel.

Segundo a rede Al Jazeera, que conversou com o pai de Tamimi, Bassem – ele próprio um ativista de direitos humanos da região – soldados das Forças Armadas de Israel bateram às 3h da casa da família, entraram na residência e a detiveram, sem apresentar as razões.

No dia anterior, no entanto, um vídeo de Tamimi em que ela brigando com dois soldados israelenses, exigindo que eles saíssem da vila de Nabi Saleh, viralizou na internet. Os militares estavam na região reprimindo palestinos que protestavam contra a declaração do presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, que reconheceu Jersualém como capital de Israel.

Segundo o exército israelense, a família de Tamimi teria permitido que um grupo de palestinos usasse a casa dela para atirar pedras nos soldados. Bassem disse à Jazeera, no entanto, que a versão de Israel não conta toda a história – e que o vídeo passou a ser registrado após os militares atirarem bombas de gás lacrimogêneo diretamente contra a residência.

A mãe de Tamimi, Nariman, foi presa na tarde do mesmo dia, quando foi visitar a filha na prisão.

Em 2012, uma imagem de Tamimi correu o mundo. No meio de uma estrada deserta, cercada de paisagem árida, ela, com a insígnia da paz estampada no peito, enfrentou dezenas de soldados, protegidos com capacetes e metralhadoras. O contraste da imagem chocou, mas nem as armas em punho foram capazes de amedrontar a então criança, que continuou a gritar e empurrar os oficiais em busca de respostas. A única resposta recebida foram balas de borracha.

“Eu lembro que o pior período da nossa vida foi quando prenderam o meu pai pela primeira vez. As autoridades israelenses não nos deram autorização para visitá-lo”, contou ela então a Opera Mundi. Detido por oficiais israelenses por seu papel de liderança nos protestos pacíficos, Bassem teve de enfrentar a corte militar de Israel por 13 vezes e chegou a passar mais de três anos no cárcere, sem nenhum julgamento.

1590,1,,"Nyligen hölls det en offentlig manifestation mot NATO på Gotland där Stefan Lindgren var en av de inbjudna talarna. Bland arrangörerna för manifestationen fanns såväl Miljöpartiet, som Feministiskt Initiativ och Vänsterpartiet, men även det stalinistiska partiet Kommunistiska Partiet. För att undvika att detta återupprepas kan det vara värt att kika lite på vad Stefan Lindgren egentligen skriver om på sin blogg och vad han förespråkar.

Stefan Lindgren är en känd vänsterprofil och f d redaktör för tidningen Gnistan, men har ändå har skrivit för Fria Tider (för ett exempel, se här!)

Det är intressant. Fria Tider står nämligen nära det nyfascistiska nätverket Motpol och sprider antisemitiska konspirationsteorier. (Se Polimasaren, länk här och Svenska Kommittén Mot Antisemitism, länk här)

”När det avslöjades att en kandidat på en av Centerpartiets listor inför valet 2014 spridit en grovt antisemitisk video från den tidigare Ku Klux Klan-ledaren David Duke var Fria Tiders vinkel att politikern ”spridit en video där det förekommer kritik mot judar, även känt som antisemitism”.

Förintelseförnekaren Richard Williamson hävdade 2009, intervjuad av SVT:s Uppdrag Granskning, att inte en enda jude gasades ihjäl av nazisterna och att inte fler än 200 000-300 000 judar dog i nazistiska koncentrationsläger. I en nyhet om biskopen från 2014 skrev Fria Tider att ”Williamson konstaterade att historiska bevis starkt talar emot att gaskammare användes för att utrota judar på order av Adolf Hitler”.”

Stefan Lindgren har de sista åren gjort sig känd för att söka en allians med högerextremister i ämnen som båda är överens om. Som Syrien, som att arbeta mot NATO, som att bekämpa ”sionism” och ”Israel”. Lindgren har själv beskrivit det i en artikel där han försvarar Jan Myrdal, som också skrivit för Fria Tider. ”Finns beröringspunkter bör de prövas”.

”Om det politiska diktatet lyder att bojkotta, frysa ut, förtiga fenomen som Nya tider, Fria Tider etc så är det en radikals uppgift att undersöka om de erbjuder några användbara sprickor i muren. Finns det beröringspunkter – som kritik av Sveriges undfallenhet för USA eller kritik av en anti-nationell, proimperialistisk diskurs – bör de också prövas. Det betyder inte att man godkänner rasism eller främlingsfientlighet. ” (Källa)

Han jämför denna allians med den gång när när han försvarade förintelseförnekaren Robert Faurisson. På samma sätt som förintelseförnekarens åsikter var viktiga i debatten är Fria Tiders röst viktig idag, menar han. Lindgren menar att Faurisson har fel i mycket men rätt i en hel del: ”bilden av judeutrotningarna har korrigerats en hel del under påverkan av kritiken”.

”I stället för att hata Faurisson – som är MZ:s linje – gjorde jag en intervju för Folket i Bild  med honom när han besökte Sverige, en intervju som jag tycker klargjorde hans ståndpunkter. En kritiskt tänkande individ måste inse att personer som Robert Faurisson, hur felaktiga hypoteser de än driver, kan fungera som virus som skärper immunförsvaret i en hållbar historieskrivning. Faktum är att bilden av judeutrotningarna har korrigerats en hel del under påverkan av kritiken. Även mainstreamhistoriker som Lawrence Rees har tvingats erkänna att merparten av utrotningarna skedde på östfronten och på sovjetiskt territorium (vilket Faurisson förnekade men ofrivilligt öppnade vägen för.)Att vägra peststämpla (men gärna ta hård debatt med) Nya tider är dessutom en viktig markering mot det yttrandefrihetsfientliga drev som nu går fram bland Sveriges intellektuella. ” (Källa)

Antisemiten Ahmed Rami har lagt upp delar av Lindgrens material om Faurisson på sin blogg, Radio Islam. (se det här)

Att Lindgren försvarar Fria Tider och Faurisson är ingen överraskning för oss som såg att han redan 2012 försvarade förintelseförnekaren Lasse Wilhelmson. Argumentet är att ”hedersmannen” Wilhelmson är född jude, alltså kan han inte vara antisemit.

”Linderborg tänker nu anlita juristhjälp för att väcka tryckfrihetsåtal  mot Lasse Wilhelmson.  Han har inte gjort Åsa något ont, men hon tycker sig ha upptäckt att han är antisemit.

Jag har varit kompis med Lasse Wilhelmson i det antiimperialistiska  arbetet sedan annu dazumal. Han är en hedersman och besitter stor  intellektuell integritet.

På senare år har han börjat reflektera inte bara över  Palestinakonflikten i maktpolitiska termer utan också i religiösa. Som  inte är helt ovanligt med judar som känner vämjelse över hur deras  religion används har det i Lasses fall lett till avståndstagande från  judendomen som religion.

Det måste vara honom obetaget.  Att släpa honom inför domstol för att han kritiserar den religion han  är född in i – vore ett farligt prejudikat.” (Källa här)

Wilhelmson är känd för att mena att Förintelsen är en historieförfalskning, en lögn sionisterna som konspirerar om världsmakten skapat.  (se t ex hans artikel i den antisemitiska webbtidningen Arabnyheter här). Han menar att Hitlers kamp mot judarna och andra världskriget var ”världsjudendomens” fel eftersom de ”förklarade krig” mot Hitler på 30-talet. Han har försvarat och samarbetat med såväl Israel Shamir som Ahmed Rami (källa här). Han har spritt sina teser om förintelsen på nazistiska Radio Nordfront (källa) som är en del av Nordiska Motståndsrörelsen, och dessutom på högerextrema Granskning Sverige (källa).

PÅ tal om Ahmed Rami och Wilhemson skrev Lindgren så här om Ahmed Rami på Ryska Posten.  Samma sorts försvar för en antisemitisk förintelseförnekare:

”Wilhelmssons åsikt att judisk särorganisering – åtminstone i vårt land där judarna varit helt integrerade tills alldeles nyligen – är ett steg tillbaka tycker jag är värd att diskutera i alla fall. Och måste allt på Ramis hemsida vara förgiftat bara för att han har en arabnationalistisk, antijudisk hangup? Så som en betydande del av världen (dock färre än de som domineras av antipalestinska, antiarabiska hangups).”  (Källa)

Dessutom har Stefan Lindgren försvarat det grovt antimuslimska och rasistiska nätverket Pegida. (Källa) (Källa) (Källa) (Källa)

”Nu börjar förkortningen Pegida – patriotiska européer mot islamisering  av västerlandet – att dyka upp i massmedia.

Somliga är blixtsnabbt framme och stämplar de nya tyska  massdemonstrationerna som invandrarfientliga och rentav rasistiska.  Samtidigt tvingas de som Dagens Nyheters Jan Lewenhagen (jag minns honom  från tiden innan han blev oskuld) att erkänna att de är vanliga Dresdenbor som demonstrerar…

Det är inte Pegida som hetsar tyskar mot muslimer.  Eliterna från Merkel till Maas, från Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung till  Tageszeitung sprider sanningsvidrigt, att Pegida handlar om islamätare,  rasister och nazister.

Så ska de ungefär fyra miljonerna muslimerna i Tyskland göras medgörliga och  upphetsade mot tyskarna! Antifa (de våldsbenägna ”antifascistiska  grupperna, ö.a.) är att förstå som den väpnade armén i sådan antitysk hets… I verkligheten har Pegida gjort klart och tydligt att de inte är mot islam, utan mot islamiseringen…”  (Källa)

Han citerade Pegidas Jürgen Elsässer då han hetsade mot flyktingar i ett av sina alster. Invandrarna sågs där som en invasionsstyrka. (På nyhetsbanken.se 160109.)

”Bitte, låt er inte förskräckas. När ni ser att medborgare är hotade till liv och lem, förhindra det: dvs. fram med batongen och ut med CS-gasen. I nödfall kan också en rejäl mängd skott över huvudena störa. Och när människoliv hotas, då har ni den rätt, ja till och med plikten att förhindra mordförsök genom målinriktade skott. Ännu är Tyskland inte förlorat. Ännu är ni bättre beväpnade än de invaderande. Men angriparna har fått blodad tand.”(källa)

Om man söker lite hittar man en hel del andra skäl till varför man inte bör ta i Stefan Lindgren med tång ens.

Ursäkta att jag frågar men vad har Stefan Lindgren att göra på manifestationer arrangerade av Miljöpartiet, Feministiskt Initiativ och Vänsterpartiet?

Den systemkritiske palestiniern samt medborgarjournalisten Bechir Rabani hittades avliden i sitt hem under fredagsmorgonen. Dödsfallet har bekräftats av Rabanis vänner och just nu haglar kondoleanser in på Rabanis Facebooksida. Dödsorsaken är ännu oklar.

Bechir Rabani från Megafonerna blev känd i hela Sverige när han tidigare i år försökte konfrontera Expressens chefredaktör Thomas Mattson och hans journalist Diamant Salihu i deras respektive hem i Stockholm.

Nyligen släpptes första delen i en dokumentärserie vid namn ”I skammens skugga” som Rabani och Megafonerna arbetar med. Dokumentärserien handlar om den våldtäktsepidemi som drabbat svenska kvinnor idag som en direkt konsekvens av den orkestrerade massinvandringen. Syftet med dokumentären är att upplysa samt ge svenska kvinnor som blivit våldtagna en plattform att berätta om sina upplevelser. Rabani har även medverkat i Radio Nordfront där han bland annat berättade om sin bakgrund. Här kan du lyssna på avsnittet.

I samband med Nordiska motståndsrörelsens demonstration i Göteborg begav sig Rabani ut på Göteborgs gator för att infiltrera den vänsterextrema globalistpöblen för att se hur dessa betedde sig. Inifrån pöblen kunna Rabani bland annat avslöja hur våldsverkarna kastade stenar och bangers mot polisen, för att sedan fly för sina liv när polisen börja promenera lugnt emot dem.

Rabanis senaste projekt han arbetade med var när han åkte hem till juden Robert Aschberg, som dock inte ville låta sig intervjuas.

Se Bechir Rabanis dokumentär som publicerades några dagar innan han påträffades död:

Senast igår kväll, bara några timmar innan dödsfallet, postade Rabani ett inlägg på Facebook där han utlovade ny information om Aschberg.

Men Rabani hann, vad Nordfront erfar, aldrig posta informationen. Bechir Rabani blev 33 år gammal.

Nordfront har genom flera trovärdiga källor bekräftat informationen om att Bechir Rabani är avliden och skickar hälsningar till hans anhöriga i denna svåra stund.

Uppdatering 15:32:

Enligt källor som Nordfront bedömer som mycket trovärdiga led Bechir Rabani INTE av någon sjukdom utan dödsfallet kommer som en total chock.

",1,434,Undersökte Robert Aschberg -- sedan dog medborgarjournalisten Bechir Rabani | Nordfront.se,https://www.nordfront.se/medborgarjournalisten-bechir-rabani-har-avlidit.smr,,
1593,4,,"INRIKES. Trots att många anser att medborgarjournalisten Bechir Rabanis plötsliga bortgång väckte många frågetecken så kommer polisen inte att utreda dödsfallet. Polisen i Skåne har istället bedömt att händelsen var ett ”dödsfall utan misstanke om brott”.

När medborgarjournalisten Bechir Rabani avled hastigt under natten till fredagen var det många inom den systemkritiska rörelsen som noterade att det skedde just i samband med en pågående granskning av den mäktige mediamannen Robert Aschberg. Rabani och Megafonerna hade nyligen publicerat ett filmklipp om Aschberg, som bland annat innehöll ett hembesök hos den judiske mångmiljonären.

Nu har dock Skånepolisen meddelat att man inte kommer att undersöka dödsfallet som mord eller liknande, rapporterar Samhällsnytt.

— Vi har rubricerat det som ett dödsfall utan misstanke om brott, berättar Region Syds kommunikatör Åsa Emanuelsson för tidningen.

Helsingborgspolisens presskontakt Eva-Lotta Hermansson berättar också för Samhällsnytt att man haft poliser på plats i Rabanis bostad som har ”tittat sig omkring”, men att detta är standardförfarande när någon avlider. Hon berättar också att ifall man exempelvis hade sett blod någonstans så skulle man ha ”dragit igång direkt”.

Men när Samhällsnyttjournalisten Egor Putilov når tjänstgörande stationsbefäl i Helsingborg blir tonen genast lite märkligare. Befälet vill varken uppge sitt namn eller svara på frågor ifall toxikologiska rapporter ingår i standardobduktioner.

— Om det visar sig att han dött av hjärtinfarkt då är det det som är dödsorsaken, konstaterar dock det anonyma befälet.

När Putilov frågar ifall befälet känner till att nervgifter kan orsaka hjärtinfarkter blir svaret:

— Det vet jag ingenting om… Men obduktionen ska visa om han har tagit något.

Personen slänger också enligt Putilov hastigt på luren när han eller hon ombeds att uppge sitt namn än en gång.

Samhällsnytt meddelar att man kommer att återkomma i ärendet ifall det tillkommer ny information från Helsingborgspolisen.

Tidigare idag bröt också Aftonbladet den regimtrogna medians tystnad kring Rabanis död, genom uttalanden från Aschberg själv samt tidningens ansvariga utgivare Lena Mellin. Läs mer HÄR.

1595,2,,"Five migrant men in Sweden charged with what one lawyer described as the worst gang rape she had ever worked on have all walked free.

The incident, which happened in the Fittja area of Stockholm last summer, involved up to 20 men but only five were identified and charged.

According to the 30-year-old victim, the migrants “discussed who would get to use me first” before pulling her up to the second floor of a stairwell. “Many stood waiting for their turn,” she added.

The migrants allegedly smashed the woman’s head against the staircase, knocking her unconscious, as well as threatening her with a knife. The entire incident was caught on surveillance cameras.

After the brutal ordeal, the woman tried to flag down numerous locals for help but was ignored each time.

The five men were all acquitted by the Södertörn District Court earlier today on the basis that the woman had sex with them voluntarily.

Despite the court acknowledging that the victim had sustained injuries, because “the origin of or reason for them could not be established,” they were not admissible as evidence of violent rape.

Despite reports that the men had filmed the incident on their cellphones and were seen laughing throughout, the court dismissed this because “videos of the incident were not found.” Presumably, the notion that the perpetrators simply deleted the videos was not considered.

The alleged victim’s lawyer Elisabeth Massi Fritz expressed her shock at the verdict, calling it “an embarrassment for our legal system”.

“No perpetrators should escape such a cruel and ruthless gang rape. This is the worst gang rape I have worked on in 26 years,” said Fritz, adding that she does not believe her client was given a fair trial because the woman had narcotics in her system at the time of the incident and was seeking to buy drugs.

Fritz says she will appeal the ruling, vowing, “We will never give up.”

As we previously reported, Sweden’s migrant ghettos are now so dangerous that police are installing microphones to pick up the sound of women screaming.

While the mainstream media has embarked on a disinformation campaign to downplay the severity of sexual assaults since Sweden began accepting more Muslim migrants in 2015, rapes have increased by 14% since last year. A recent poll also found that half of young women in the country felt insecure walking the streets.

Sexual assaults on women at music festivals in Sweden have also risen by 1000%, with feminists and organizers responding by proposing that all men be banned from such events.

While sexual assaults and rapes of women are spiraling out of control, the Swedish government is busy publishing reports that say putting the word “refugees” in quotation marks is “hate” and that questioning the age of child migrants is also a form of extremism.

Serrano Súñer, creador del tribunal represor, Francisco Franco y Benito Mussolini.

Javier Zurro

España tiene más de 150.000 muertos a sus espaldas por culpa de Franco. Muchos de ellos están en cunetas. Es el segundo país con más fosas comunes después de Camboya y, sin embargo, las víctimas del franquismo no tienen ni un mísero monumento que las recuerde. En cambio, tienen que ver cómo las personas que asesinaron a sus familiares durante la guerra y la dictadura han sido reconocidos con calles, o incluso un mausoleo como el Valle de los Caídos, donde cada año se realizan misas en honor a Franco y Primo de Rivera. Por si fuera poco, aquellos que se atreven a pedir dignidad para sus muertos son abandonados a su suerte. La justicia no les defiende, y el estado no les apoya. Son otros países u otras instituciones las que les dan el soporte económico para luchar.

España tiene un problema con la memoria histórica. Nunca se cerraron las heridas, y la basura se escondió debajo de la alfombra. Mientras que países como Camboya, Argentina o Alemania pidieron perdón por los crímenes cometidos durante las dictaduras y sus gobernantes fueron juzgados por crímenes contra la humanidad, en nuestro país nunca ocurrió lo mismo. La transición, esa que muchos bautizaron como modélica, estableció que para seguir adelante había que perdonar todo a todos. Lo que parecía un parche provisional se ha quedado enquistado y se sigue manteniendo, de tal forma que mencionar el tema supone una brecha y un conflicto.

Fotograma de Lesa Humanitat.

Para intentar explicar por qué habría que comenzar un auténtico proceso de revisión de nuestra memoria, llega el documental de Héctor Faver Lesa Humanitat, que plantea dos dudas al espectador: ¿cómo es posible que el franquismo no haya sido juzgado por crímenes contra la humanidad?, y ¿hasta qué punto la herencia de la dictadura ha llegado a nuestros días? Con declaraciones de víctimas de la represión franquista, el juez Garzón, y presidentes de asociaciones por la recuperación de la Memoria Histórica, se construye una película que disecciona qué ha pasado desde aquel fatídico 1936.

Su director explica que este documental “no tiene que ver con derechas e izquierdas, sino con los derechos básicos humanos”. “Queremos que de una vez se trate esto como en cualquier democracia digna. Es inadmisible que tras 40 años de democracia tengamos más de 100.000 personas desaparecidas y que no se haga justicia”, cuenta a EL ESPAÑOL el director del documental. Para Fáver es hora de tomar medidas, y “gobierne quien gobierne lo tiene que resolver, no hay ningún motivo para que no se haga nada y los pocos que lo hacen lo paguen de su bolsillo, en un estado democrático esos gastos deberían ser por parte del estado”.

Para él hay que traer “justicia y reparación” y habría que preguntar a todos los gobernantes que ha habido por qué no lo han hecho, y también por qué nunca se juzgó al franquismo por crímenes contra la humanidad, algo que tienen claro que debería haberse hecho “como en cualquier otra dictadura como la de Pol Pot o las del este”. “Parece ser que estamos en una democracia, porque si estuviéramos en un régimen franquista seria lógico que se protegiera, pero estando en democracia es inentendible que haya trabas para que no se pueda normalizar la situación”, zanja.

Un problema que cree que se ha extendido a la educación, ya que los jóvenes estudian mal la historia de España y peor la dictadura. Una extensión de aquella transición que para el “no ha sido modélica”. “No voy a entrar en si en aquel momento fue lo mejor que se pudo hacer, porque aunque fuera así han pasado 40 años”, añade.

Una de las voces más críticas del documental es Chato Galante, ex preso político torturado por el franquismo, que también señala a la transición. “En España se decidió hacer una transición que renunciara a la justicia. Se decidió que se amnistiaran los crímenes de la dictadura, que no se tocara el aparato del estado y que la dictadura entronizaría a un monarca impuesto por Franco. Eso supone un déficit de ruptura respecto al régimen anterior y eso obligó a que todo girara en torno a una campaña que creó la idea de que fue una transición ejemplar. Eso intenta ocultar ese déficit, y lo que hace es que reaparezca más adelante”, dice con contundencia a este periódico.

No desprecia los logros conseguidos, y “la ruptura con la etapa anterior, eso lo hubo, te lo asegura alguien que fue torturado y estuvo en la cárcel, pero lo que también es verdad es que hay un déficit democrático en el régimen del 78”. “Y pasa con muchas cosas, hay un problema territorial cuya base es el reconocimiento del derecho a decidir de una parte de la ciudadanía, y antes de la transición el PSOE reivindicaba como principio democrático básico el derecho a la autodeterminación de los pueblos, y hay muchos testimonios orales y escritos de Felipe González diciendo eso que hoy se niega. Debemos enfrentarnos a eso y resolverlo”, apunta.

Tanto Galante como Héctor Faver coinciden en la importancia de la educación para que la memoria histórica no sea tomada como algo ideológico en lo que la derecha se posiciona en contra y la izquierda a favor. “La historia de este país se enseña de forma aberrante. Hace poco un programa de televisión hizo una encuesta y los niños conocían mejor los reyes godos que la dictadura o la transición. No saben quién fue Franco. Mucha gente lo entiende como un Gobierno autoritario, y eso pasa porque los partidos pusieron especial interés para que fuera así. El PSOE gobernó 28 años este país y en ese tiempo ha habido decenas de miles de cadáveres en las cunetas cuyo delito era haber pertenecido al PSOE. El problema de la dictadura no es de sus víctimas, es un problema de la ciudadanía, que ha terminado sufriendo un triple salto mortal a la edad media”, apunta Chato Galante, que aun así está convencido de que no hay marcha atrás, y que en los próximos años veremos cómo por fin se empieza a juzgar aquellos crímenes que siguen debajo de la alfombra.

El jefe de Gabinete, Marcos Peña , defendió hoy el accionar de las fuerzas de seguridad durante el operativo del jueves pasado en el Congreso de la Nación, condenó la “violencia” de los manifestantes que protestaron contra la reforma previsional y elogió a la ministra Patricia Bullrich, quien recibió críticas de la oposición y de Elisa Carrió, referente de Cambiemos, por el despliegue de gendarmes y policías en los alrededores del parlamento.

En una entrevista con Radio Mitre, el funcionario sostuvo que el operativo tuvo como objetivo impedir que los manifestantes “tomen” el Congreso. Además, apuntó contra los referentes del kirchnerismo y del massismo: “Ninguno condenó la violencia”.

Tras los incidentes afuera del Congreso durante las marchas contra la reforma jubilatoria, Carrió cuestionó la cantidad de gendarmes que se destinaron al operativo del jueves y sostuvo que Bullrich tenía que “parar la mano”. Desde la oposición, en tanto, volvieron a pedir la renuncia de la ministra.

Consultado sobre las críticas de Carrió a la titular de la cartera de Seguridad, Peña respondió: “En primer lugar, lo que más nos preocupa es que hubo una acción organizada para tratar de impedir la sesión con violencia y llegar al Congreso. El operativo tuvo como objetivo impedir eso”.

El ministro coordinador rechazó que Bullrich sea un “problema” para el Gobierno. “Es una muy buena ministra de Seguridad”, indicó.

En ese marco, el funcionario sostuvo que más le “llamó la atención” de la protesta fue la “violencia de los manifestantes”. “Muchas fuerzas no solo no repudiaron la violencia, sino que la promovieron. Nadie del masissmo y el kirchnerismo condenó la violencia”, apuntó.

Peña, además, volvió a defender la reforma previsional: calificó la iniciativa como “una muy buena ley”, que fue lograda “con un histórico acuerdo con los gobernadores de diferentes signos políticos”.

Sostuvo que con la nueva normativa, que se debatirá mañana en la Cámara de Diputados, los jubilados se van a beneficiar “con cinco puntos más que la inflación”. También criticó la decisión de la CGT de lanzar una huelga mañana desde las 12 en rechazo de la reforma jubilatoria. “El paro termina generando un clima más propenso para los violentos”, opinó.

El cuerpo fue hallado en una finca en la vía al corregimiento Las Canoas, en Pivijay, Magdalena. Al parecer fue interceptado por desconocidos luego de asistir a una reunión de la Mesa de Víctimas en Pivijay.

José Rafael De La Hoz Villa, integrante de la Mesa de Participación de Víctimas del municipio de Pivijay, fue asesinado la noche del viernes 15 de diciembre en área rural de este ente territorial. El cadáver fue encontrado por campesinos en una finca, ubicada en la entrada del corregimiento  Las Canoas, de esa jurisdicción.

De acuerdo con la información entregada a El Heraldo, el cuerpo de este líder de la región, presentaba múltiples heridas profundas producidas con arma cortante, al parecer machete.

Familiares manifestaron que el 14 de diciembre estuvo en una reunión de la Mesa de Víctimas en Pivijay y al término de la misma salió en su moto rumbo a Las Canoas, donde residía. Se supone que fue interceptado por desconocidos quienes le dieron muerte.

Su muerte ha causado consternación en el Departamento pues gozaba de simpatía y aprecio, dada su entrega incondicional al proceso de las víctimas. “Con cariño le llamábamos el ‘Papi Villa’, aunque su primer apellido fuere De La Hoz”, dijo su primo Edinson.

1605,1,,"Mariano Pacheco* / Resumen Latinoamericano, 17 de Diciembre de 2017 – Como conjurando la nostalgia y dándole la espalda al gesto hueco de la conmemoración vacía, este año el aniversario de las jornadas insurreccionales del 19 y 20 de diciembre de 2001 se rememoraron en las calles de la ciudad de Buenos Aires sin que nadie lo haya convocado con tales fines. Una REMEMORACION que tiene su nueva cita este lunes 18 frente al Congreso, mas que el miércoles 20 en la Plaza de Mayo, ya que 2001 tiene más que ver con la la masividad, la creatividad y la lucha de calles que con la prolijidad de palcos con lecturas de documentos o listas interminables de oradores, como hemos visto en años anteriores.

“La historia tiene mas imaginación que nosotros”, escribió alguna vez Karl Marx; quien también aseveró que éramos los hombres (las mujeres, las existencias diversas) quienes hacíamos la historia, siempre bajo determinadas circunstancias.

¿Cuales son nuestras circunstancias?

Como durante el 19 y 20 de Diciembre, también en las del 13 y 14 sucedió que cada el 13 y 14 cada jornada tuvo su singularidad, incluso sus protagonistas diferenciados (aunque asi como hubo quienes estuvieron tanto 19 como 20 así lo hicieron el 13 y 14).

El 13, la masividad y el protagonismo central de quienes integran los movimientos sociales mayoritarios: la Confederación de Trabajadores de la Economía Popular (CTEP), Barrios de pie, la Corriente Clasista y Combativa (CCC); el 14, algunos de ellos, junto con algunas pocas columnas sindicales: la Juventud Sindical, la Unión Obrera Metalúrgica (UOM), la Asociación de Trabajadores del Estado (ATE) y el protagonismo mayoritario de las militancias de las organizaciones y partidos de izquierda en sus distintas variantes y sectores del peronismo/kirchnerismo.

La gran diferencia con 2001 es que ahora no estamos en la cresta de la ola de un proceso creciente de resistencia popular, como entonces, cuando las luchas contra el delarruismo condensaban un proceso previo de al menos cuatro años (1996-1999) de acumulación de fuerzas de los sectores populares, con los trabajadores desocupados como nuevo actor social a la cabeza.

Ahora hay más agrupamientos, mayor cantidad de militancia –es cierto– pero ni en la sociedad argentina hay el hartazgo que antes había respecto de las políticas neoliberales, ni en las militancias la audancia de esos dias (tampoco habia entonces unos micro-fascismos tan activos como los que ahora circulan).

¿Entonces? ¿Con qué nos volvimos de las jornadas del 13 y 14?

Al menos con un par de cuestiones. Tal vez la central: una “ganancia subjetiva”. Hemos logrado quebrar cierta modorra instalada en el campo popular ante los ataques recibidos (con obvios antecedentes de “sacudimiento” expresados en el Paro Mundial de Mujeres, las movilizaciones contra el 2×1 y por Santiago Maldonado, las medidas de fuerza reividicativas de las y los trabajadores de la economía popular). Se recuperó cierta inciativa (nos movilizamos antes de que se consumen los hechos) y por sobre todo, pudimos REACTIVAR LA CAPACIDAD DE AUTODEFENSA.

LECCIÓN FUNDAMENTAL: necesitamos UNIDAD Y MASIVIDAD sin renunciar a la AUDACIA Y COMBATIVIDAD.

Diciembre recién comienza, a pesar del calor y el cansancio de los cuerpos. Pero bien sabemos que nunca, de antemano, podenos saber lo que un cuerpo puede.

Veremos lo que podemos este 18.

Mañana tenemos una cita importante frent a la historia. En el Congreso, pero también en otras plazas y esquinas del país.

O estudo tamb�m mostrou que 13 milh�es de brasileiros ainda vivem em pobreza extrema, e que tarefas dom�sticas impedem um ter�o das mulheres jovens de trabalhar ou estudar.

O IBGE divide o mercado de trabalho em seis estratos —A, B, C, D, E e F—, segundo o tipo de ocupa��o e o rendimento m�dio, com base em dados de 2014.

No estrato A, por exemplo, ent�o cargos de ger�ncia, dirigentes de empresa, advogados e professores de n�vel superior, com rendimento m�dio variando entre R$ 3.737 (professores e advogados) e R$ 4.681 (gerentes e dirigentes).

No estrato B, est�o t�cnicos de n�vel m�dio (rendimento de R$ 2.457); no C, trabalhadores de servi�os administrativos (R$ 1.564); no D, trabalhadores da produ��o de bens e servi�os e de repara��o e manuten��o (R$ 1.460); no E, trabalhadores dos servi�os e vendedores e prestadores de servi�os do com�rcio (R$ 982 e R$ 1.263) e no F, trabalhadores agr�colas (R$ 628).

MOBILIDADE DE LONGA DIST�NCIA* - Por g�nero e cor ou ra�a, em %

Entre quem ascendeu para um estrato melhor, a grande maioria —49,1%— foi para os estratos D ou E. Como esse avan�o � pequeno e concentrado na base da pir�mide social, o IBGE o classifica como ""mobilidade de curta dist�ncia"".

""A compara��o entre a estrutura ocupacional de filhos com a dos seus pais evidencia uma redu��o consider�vel dos estratos ligados � ocupa��o agr�cola (Estrato F) e um aumento dos estratos ocupacionais formados por trabalhadores manuais e n�o manuais urbanos de baixa qualifica��o (Estratos E e D)"", diz o IBGE no estudo.

Apenas 21,2% dos filhos de pais da base da pir�mide ascenderam para o estrato A.

J� no estrato A, a imobilidade social (ou seja, o percentual de filhos que se mant�m no mesmo estrato do pai) � alta, de 54,2%, e as chances de continuarem nessa posi��o s�o 13,7 vezes maiores do que de um indiv�duo proveniente do D, E ou F migrar ao estrato A.

O estudo do IBGE tamb�m observou que a mobilidade social � menor entre pretos ou pardos do que entre brancos —65,1% vs. 68,8%, tanto ascendente quanto descendente.

Na an�lise de longa dist�ncia, um indiv�duo branco tem o dobro das chances de conseguir migrar dos estratos D, E ou F para o A do que um preto ou pardo.

Os resultados apontam que para a popula��o preta ou parda, � mais dif�cil ascender ou mesmo permanecer no mesmo estrato do que para a popula��o branca.

MOBILIDADE DE LONGA DIST�NCIA* - Por cor ou ra�a, em %

""Diversos estudos que analisaram as chances relativas de mobilidade entre brancos e n�o brancos confirmam a exist�ncia de barreiras raciais � mobilidade intergeracional no Brasil"", afirma o instituto.

Na an�lise por g�nero, o IBGE identificou que h� maior mobilidade social entre mulheres do que entre homens, tanto para melhor quanto para pior.

Um ter�o das mulheres que ascenderam na base da pir�mide, por exemplo, migraram para o estrato E —que engloba trabalhadoras dom�sticas e vendedores—, enquanto um ter�o dos homens nesse grupo migraram para o D —formado por pedreiros e motoristas.

MOBILIDADE DE LONGA DIST�NCIA* - Por g�nero, em %

Por outro lado, as mulheres t�m mais facilidade para ascender da base da pir�mide para o topo do que os homens: 15,2% vs. 10,2%.

Uma das explica��es poss�veis para esse resultado, segundo o IBGE, � o maior n�vel de escolaridade das mulheres, enquanto h� maior reten��o de homens em ocupa��es rurais.

A mobilidade educacional —analisada pela compara��o entre o n�vel de instru��o dos filhos em rela��o ao de seu pai— � maior do que a ocupacional: 68,9% melhoraram de escolaridade, enquanto apenas 5% pioraram.

Segundo o IBGE, os dados s�o resultado da intensa expans�o educacional no Brasil nos �ltimos anos. A propor��o de pessoas com n�vel ""m�dio completo e superior incompleto"" foi a que mais cresceu em compara��o com a gera��o de seus pais, passando de 10% para 34,2%. No n�vel superior completo, o percentual foi de 5,3% para 18%.

O instituto avalia que as mudan�as na estrutura educacional tendem a ser mais r�pidas do que na ocupacional, o que pode criar um problema uma vez que, apesar da popula��o ter um n�vel de instru��o cada vez mais alto, isso n�o vai se traduzir em melhora em sua condi��o no mercado de trabalho.

A pesquisa tamb�m observou que quanto menor o n�vel educacional do pai, menores as chances do filho conseguir alcan�ar um n�vel de instru��o alto. Apenas 4,6% dos filhos de pai sem instru��o conseguiu concluir o ensino superior. J� entre filhos de pai com ensino superior, esse percentual sobe para 69,6%.

O efeito do aumento do n�vel de instru��o dos pais sobre os filhos tamb�m varia dependendo da cor ou ra�a. Entre brancos, o percentual de filhos de pai com ensino m�dio completo ou superior incompleto que concluiu o ensino superior � de 49,5%, enquanto entre pretos ou pardos esse n�mero cai quase pela metade, para 28,4%.

""Esses resultados v�o ao encontro de estudos anteriores que conclu�ram que a desigualdade de oportunidades educacionais no Brasil � marcada pela estratifica��o racial e que essa desigualdade parece ser ainda mais acentuada nos n�veis mais elevados do sistema educacional"", diz o IBGE.

Na compara��o entre g�nero, a pesquisa confirma a tend�ncia j� identificada de maior mobilidade educacional entre mulheres do que entre homens.

After 37 years, Voyager 1 has fired up its trajectory thrusters

This week, the scientists and engineers on the Voyager team did something very special.

Enlarge  The Voyager team is able to use a set of four backup thrusters, dormant since 1980. They are located on the back side of the spacecraft in this orientation.

At present, the Voyager 1 spacecraft is 21 billion kilometers from Earth, or about 141 times the distance between the Earth and Sun. It has, in fact, moved beyond our Solar System into interstellar space. However, we can still communicate with Voyager across that distance.

This week, the scientists and engineers on the Voyager team did something very special. They commanded the spacecraft to fire a set of four trajectory thrusters for the first time in 37 years to determine their ability to orient the spacecraft using 10-millisecond pulses.

The Voyagers have reached an anniversary worth celebrating

After sending the commands on Tuesday, it took 19 hours and 35 minutes for the signal to reach Voyager. Then, the Earth-bound spacecraft team had to wait another 19 hours and 35 minutes to see if the spacecraft responded. It did. After nearly four decades of dormancy, the Aerojet Rocketdyne manufactured thrusters fired perfectly.

""The Voyager team got more excited each time with each milestone in the thruster test. The mood was one of relief, joy, and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all,"" said Todd Barber, a propulsion engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.

A gallery of Voyager’s greatest hits—and they are truly great

In recent decades, Voyager had been relying on its primary thrusters to keep the spacecraft properly oriented so that it can maintain a communications link with Earth. But these attitude control thrusters have been degrading over time, requiring more and more energy each time they've been used.

By switching to the spacecraft's ""trajectory correction maneuver"" thrusters, last used during the spacecraft's encounter with Saturn in 1980, engineers say they will be able to extend the lifetime of Voyager by two or three more years before its waning power reserves expire.

Bad Bergzabern – Zu einem Tag der offenen Tür luden Bundespolizei und Bundeswehr am Sonntag, 25.06.17, von 9 bis 18 Uhr ein und feierten ihre Jubiläen (30 Jahre Bundespolizei und 55 Jahre Bundeswehr in Bad Bergzabern).

Der Tag begann mit einem Ökumenischen Gottesdienst. Um 10:15 Uhr wurde die Veranstaltung offiziell durch die Dienststellenleiter eröffnet. Ministerpräsident a. D. Kurt Beck, der Mitarbeiter im Bundeswehr-Elektronikzentrum Bad Bergzabern war, sprach Grußworte.

Angeboten wurde ein abwechslungsreiches informatives Programm. Publikumsliebling waren die Diensthunde der Bundespolizei. Bei gestellten Einsatzübungen zeigten die Diensthundeführer mit ihren Vierbeinern ihre Leistungsfähigkeit.

Beim Polizeitraining wurden Angriffszenen und Verteidigungsreaktionen gezeigt.

Auch für die Höhenrettung sind Beamte gerüstet. Hier geht es weniger um die Rettung von Verletzten, wofür die Feuerwehr zuständig ist, sondern um die Festnahme von mutmaßlichen Tätern. Bei den Vorführungen hatte sich ein Aktivist an einer Laterne festgekettet und ein Transparent gehisst.

Bei einer taktischen Übung wurde die Vorgehensweise einer Einsatzeinheit bei einer Demo gezeigt.

Weiter bot die Bundespolizei Kinderschminken, Basteln oder Fotos auf dem Polizeimotorrad an. „Dienstausweise“ wurden für die Kids erstellt, die BigBand des Bundespolizeiorchester Berlin spielte zur Unterhaltung, Hilfsorganisationen (DRK und THW), die Feuerwehr und der Zoll informierten über ihre Aufgaben und Einsätze.

Die Bundeswehr hatte eine Rad- und Kettenfahrzeuge mitgebracht. Unter anderem waren der Kampfpanzer Leopard, Feldartillerie, Schwerlasttransporter Elefant und andere geländegängige Fahrzeuge zu sehen. Auch über das Elektronikzentrum war einiges zu erfahren.

Im Jahr 2022 soll es nach Polizeiangaben wieder einen Tag der offenen Tür geben. Voraussetzung sei es, dass genügend Kräfte zur Verfügung stehen.

1629,1,,"Am Freitag war ein verdächtiges Paket bei einem Apotheker abgegeben worden, der am Weihnachtsmarkt sein Geschäft hat. Die Polizei fahndet nach dem Absender des Pakets. Dieses sei von einem Lieferdienst zugestellt worden, sagte der Landesvorsitzende der Gewerkschaft der Polizei in Brandenburg, Andreas Schuster, am Samstag im Deutschlandfunk. Man stehe auch in Kontakt mit dem Bundeskriminalamt, um herauszufinden, ob es vergleichbare Fälle gegeben habe.

Die Ermittlungen zum Inhalt des Pakets dauerten jedoch noch an, so Schuster. Das Paket sei mit einem scharfen Wasserstrahl zerstört worden. Dadurch sei es in Hunderte Teile zerlegt worden, die jetzt wieder in der Kriminaltechnik zusammengefügt werden müssen. Dort werde auch überprüft, ob es kleine oder kleinste Teile von Sprengstoff in diesem Paket gegeben habe.

Mitarbeiter einer Apotheke in der Postdamer Innenstadt hatten am Freitag am frühen Nachmittag die Polizei gerufen, weil ihnen das Paket verdächtig vorkam. Die Sicherheitskräfte hätten die Lieferung unter die Lupe genommen und darin unter anderem einen metallischen Zylinder, Batterien und Nägel entdeckt, erklärte die Polizei.

Die deutschen Weihnachtsmärkte stehen nach Einschätzung der Sicherheitsbehörden auch in diesem Jahr im Visier radikaler Islamisten. „Die Gefährdungslage in Europa und damit auch in Deutschland ist anhaltend hoch”, hatte ein Sprecher des Bundesinnenministeriums am Montag gesagt.

Wenn der Schutzmann um die Ecke gelaufen kommt, wird er gern vom Bürger angesprochen. Ergebnis der Konversation ist oftmals eine Strafanzeige im Sinne des Bürgers, denn Polizeibeamte sind von Amts wegen verpflichtet, beim Verdacht von Straftaten tätig zu werden. Fehlt der Schutzmann vor Ort, gibt es deutlich weniger Straftaten in der Statistik, nicht etwa weil diese nicht stattfinden würden, sondern weil Menschen keine Ansprechpartner vorfinden.

Die effektivste Form der Polizeiarbeit ist und bleibt die Fußstreife. Daran ändern auch die sogenannten Internetwachen nichts. Spitze Zungen empfehlen deshalb die Abschaffung der Polizei, dann gäbe es gar keine Straftaten mehr. Oh Schreck, die Zahl der Gewohnheitstäter nahm in Berlin im Jahr 2016 um 2,4% wieder zu. Was für eine Überraschung! Von den 6.931 Tatverdächtigen waren 2.464 Nichtdeutsche, 323 „unklarer Herkunft“, 1.638 Deutsche mit Migrationshintergrund und 2.505 Deutsche. Mehr als verdoppelt habe sich darunter die Anzahl der Personen mit „unsicherem Aufenthaltsstatus“.

Innenstaatssekretär Christian Gaebler (SPD) ist besorgt und vermutet als Ursache bei jungen Flüchtlingen und Zuwanderern „archaische Vorstellungen von Ehre“ und die „hohe Akzeptanz von Gewalt in der Gesellschaft“. Als weitere Ursachen werden angeführt: Eine „misslungene Integration“ durch „Sprache, Bildung, unzeitgemäße Rollenbilder, mangelnder beruflicher Teilhabe, Akzeptanz unserer Werte und Normen sowie an der teilweise wahrzunehmenden Herausbildung von religiösen Fanatismen“.

Aha, wer hätte das gedacht. Sozialarbeiter sollen es im Verbund mit der Justiz und der Polizei richten. Das erinnert mich an die Brandenburger Polizei, dort erteilt ein Psychologe der Polizei „Einsatzhinweise“ für Gefährderlagen (ab S.104 rechts unten). Meine Sorge als zertifizierter Trainer: Hoffentlich setzt sie niemand ausschließlich um. Hochglanz- und Vorzeigeprojekte in der Theorie und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit, wie ich sie zur Genüge kenne.

Demgegenüber stehen Berliner Schrottschulen, Unterrichtsausfall, heruntergekommene Turnhallen und Toiletten, Mobbing und Kriminalität. Mangelnde Integration durch mangelnde personelle und finanzielle Mittel, in Verantwortung des rot-rot-grünen Senats. Damit es keiner merkt, gibt es für Schulleiter und Lehrer einen Maulkorberlass. Schulsenatorin Sandra Scheeres (SPD) vergisst nicht hinzuzufügen, „… dass es manchmal schon zum Selbstschutz der Schule angezeigt ist, Drehtermine und Presseanfragen an die Pressestelle der Senatsverwaltung zu melden“. Nun, diesen Satz könnte man auch als Drohung verstehen.

Nun sollen es also einige Sozialarbeiter richten. Die Liebesmüh wird, von einzelnen Erfolgen abgesehen, zwar nicht kostenlos aber umsonst sein.

Synapsen, die die Nervenzellen verbinden, bilden sich grundlegend bereits in den ersten beiden Lebensjahren heraus. Bis zum sechsten Lebensjahr sind wir Menschen geprägt. Kinder, die keine empathische Zuwendung und sichere Elternbindungen erfahren, archaische Familien, in denen die Prügelstrafe vorherrscht, können keine Spiegelneuronen entwickeln, die ein sozialisiertes Miteinander ermöglichen.

Eine Kultur, in der die Frau kein gleichwertiger Mensch ist, wird Kindern nicht ermöglichen, weibliche Lehrkräfte, Polizistinnen oder Frauen auf der Straße zu akzeptieren. Abhanden gekommener Anpassungsdruck verhindert eine Integration in die Gesellschaft, denn schon jetzt ist man selbst in vielen Schulklassen „unter sich“, erst recht, was die eigene Clique auf der Straße betrifft. Bandenbildung in Großstädten, natürlich sind auch Deutsche dabei. Wenn „unbegleitete Flüchtlinge” ihre syrischen Großfamilien nachholen und die Traditionen der Kinderehe, Gebärzwang und Frauenapartheid weiterleben, werden weitere unlösbare Probleme auf uns zukommen. Warum Migranten mit subsidiärem Schutz ihre Familien nachholen müssen, entspringt für mich einer linksgrünen Phantasie und Ideologie, aber keinen sachlichen Gründen. Es steht die Frage im Raum, ob es nicht aus mehreren Gründen besser wäre, archaische Familien in ihrer Heimat zu belassen, vor allem, wenn dort kein Krieg mehr stattfindet.

Seitz (1983, 50) weist darauf hin, „dass sich Straffälligkeit zu einem hohen Ausmaß als Folge einer frühen Sozialisation, speziell durch die elterliche Erziehung, erworbene Persönlichkeitsstruktur einstellt“. Je älter die Probanden, desto geringer ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Resozialisierung. Eine letzte Chance wird die Pubertät bei den Jugendlichen sein. Hier werden die in der Kindheit angelegten Nervenverbindungen noch einmal „gestrafft“ und ausgelesen. Straftaten, die aufgrund mangelnden Verfolgungsdrucks unentdeckt bleiben, da Polizeistellen „fleißig“ abgebaut wurden, stärken die antisoziale Persönlichkeit. Ungesühnte Diebstähle, Gewalt und Rücksichtslosigkeit werden als Belohnungssystem im Gehirn determiniert und sind nur noch schwer zu reparieren. Das Gleiche gilt auch, wenn durch mangelndes Justizpersonal Anklagen erst nach einem Jahr und noch später stattfinden. Dann können Jugendliche emotional nicht mehr nachvollziehen, was bei Ihnen schief gelaufen ist. Die Wirkung einer Verurteilung verpufft dann ins Nirwana.

Richterin Kirsten Heisig hatte in Berlin vor vielen Jahren gezeigt, wie es gut funktionieren kann. Wie man nachlesen darf, wurde sie gemobbt, was mich allerdings nicht wundert. Mit der Integration von kreativen Beamten, die neue Wege gehen wollen, sieht es manchmal sehr schlecht aus. Das ist in Brandenburg auch nicht anders. Die drei zugegebenen Mobbingfälle sind nur die Spitze des Eisberges.

1632,2,,"Aachen – Sie werden im Dienst angepöbelt, angegriffen und verletzt. Jetzt werden Polizisten nicht einmal mehr im Gerichtssaal respektiert, wie ein aktueller Fall zeigt.

Wolfgang Spelthahn, Landrat des Kreises Düren (NRW), hat nach einem Skandal-Prozess einen offenen Brief an den Justizminister von NRW geschrieben.

Der Grund ist diese unglaubliche Geschichte einer Verhandlung am Amtsgericht Düren:

► Am 22. November 2017 war dort eine Frau u. a. wegen zweifachen Widerstands gegen Vollstreckungsbeamte und Nötigung angeklagt. Bei Protesten gegen die Braunkohleförderung im „Hambacher Forst“ (NRW) soll sie zwei Polizisten angegriffen und verletzt haben. Der eine kam mit einer Prellung am rechten Ellenbogen ins Krankenhaus, der andere mit einer Platzwunde am Mittelfinger.

► Schon bevor Amtsrichterin Anne Utzelmann (38) die Verhandlung eröffnete, rutschten rund 20 Protestler auf dem Boden des Amtsgerichts umher, schrien lautstark und warfen mit Geldmünzen um sich.

So steht es in einem Protokoll, das mehrere Polizisten nach der Verhandlung für sich und ihren Dienstherren angefertigt haben, und das BILD vorliegt.

► Während der Aussagen der acht Polizisten sollen die Aktivisten mehrfach „Lügner“ und „Schweine“ gerufen, Nüsse geworfen, laut „geschmatzt, gerülpst und flatuliert“ haben.

Als sich der Staatsanwalt über die Störungen beschwerte, ermahnte Richterin Utzelmann zur Ruhe, verhängte aber trotz weiterer Rufe keine Ordnungsgelder, verwies die Unruhestifter auch nicht des Saales. Eine Beschwerde der Polizisten über die Lautstärke und die ständigen Zwischenrufe ignorierte sie offenbar ebenfalls. Sie sagte laut Aufzeichnung: „Sie hätte für sich herausgefunden, dass die deeskalierende Verhandlungsführung mit dieser Art von Personenkreis am sinnigsten sei.“

Auf BILD-Nachfrage sagte Richterin Utzelmann: „Ich darf dazu nichts sagen, das liegt jetzt beim Landgericht Aachen.“

Dieses wurde vom Justizministerium angewiesen, den Fall zu klären.

„Wir nehmen die Vorwürfe sehr ernst“, sagte ein Sprecher des Landgerichts.

Für Landrat Spelthahn als Dienstherr der Polizisten ist das Vorgehen der Richterin nicht nachvollziehbar: „Sie sind völlig enttäuscht und geschockt, sie sind regelrecht erniedrigt worden in diesem Verfahren.“

Unverständlich und geradezu brüskierend empfinde er zudem die Ablehnung der Richterin, ein Gespräch mit den Beamten zu führen. Der nun vorliegende Bericht stelle für ihn einen negativen Höhepunkt dar, den er nicht mehr bereit sei, „nur auf lokaler Ebene zu thematisieren“.

Arnold Plickert (60), Vorsitzender der Gewerkschaft der Polizei in NRW: „Was dort vorgefallen ist, ist skandalös. Wir diskutieren über zunehmenden fehlenden Respekt gegenüber Polizisten und dann passiert so etwas in einem deutschen Gerichtssaal.“

Die Angeklagte wurde zu 50 Sozialstunden verurteilt. Der Staatsanwalt hatte eine Geldstrafe von 60 Tagessätzen gefordert.

Maximilian Rojahn (25, Mitglied der „Jungen Gruppe“ der GdP-NRW) ist bei der Bereitschaftspolizei.

„Im normalen Dienst ist die Respektlosigkeit hoch. Es wirkt, als würde es immer schlimmer. Man hat den Eindruck, es ist normal, uns zu beschimpfen, wie im Hambacher Forst.“

Die schlimmste Erinnerung: „Ich bin einmal bei einem Fußballspiel bespuckt worden, stand mitten zwischen Fans. Der Speichel lief mein Helmvisier herunter. Das ist verachtend, eine Grenzüberschreitung. Für viele scheint es selbstverständlich zu sein, ,ACAB‘ („All Cops Are Bastards“, Alle Polizisten sind Bastarde, Anm. d. Redaktion) zu rufen. Aber viele wissen gar nicht, für was das steht. Schöne Erlebnisse sind leider selten. Beim G-20-Gipfel in Hamburg war ein positiver Rutsch in der Bevölkerung fühlbar.

Menschen kamen, bedankten sich bei uns. Wir bekamen Brötchen angeboten, weil wir so lang im Einsatz waren.“

„Beleidigungen gegen Polizisten werden von Gerichten als Bagatellen angesehen“

Er war im Juli beim G-20-Gipfel im Einsatz, wurde bei Krawallen leicht verletzt.

„Immer wieder flogen Flaschen und Steine durch die Luft. Einen Stein konnte ich mit der Hand noch abwehren, ein anderer knallte gegen meine Schulter und den Oberarm. So viel Aggression habe ich noch nie erlebt! Ich habe schon Mai-Demos und Castor-Transporte begleitet. Doch auch fernab solcher Großeinsätze erlebe ich Respektlosigkeit. Wir müssen immer diskutieren und uns rechtfertigen. Die Leute sehen nicht mehr den Menschen, der in der Uniform steckt. Viele Beleidigungen, die meine Kollegen und ich erleben, werden gar nicht mehr angezeigt.

Entweder, weil die Verfahren eingestellt werden. Oder, weil die Beleidigungen von den Gerichten als Bagatellen angesehen werden.“

Berlin – Dagmar M*. (45, Mitglied der GdP) ist Streifenpolizistin in der Hauptstadt. Seit 25 Jahren.

Die Polizeikommissarin: „Der Vorfall in Nordrhein-Westfalen spiegelt das wider, wie man sich fühlt. Sowohl aus der Bevölkerung als auch von Seiten der Behörden erfährt man null Respekt.“ Immer wieder wird die Beamtin im Dienst beleidigt und beschimpft. „Da fallen Dinge wie Schlampe, Hure, Bullenschwein, Nazi. Da war schon alles mit dabei. Mindestens zweimal die Woche passiert so etwas.“

Das schlimmste Erlebnis: Ein Einsatz wegen häuslicher Gewalt, als die Beamtin einer jungen Frau gegenüber stand. „Das werde ich nie vergessen. Sie sagte ,ich wünschte, deine Kinder würden vergewaltigt‘. Ich habe sie angezeigt. Hinter jeder Uniform steckt ein Mensch. Mit Familie und Gefühlen. Wir sind keine Maschinen.“

Nach dem Einbruch in ein Wohnhaus in der ´Obere Rötelstraße´ und dem Diebstahl eines hochwertigen Sportwagens aus der Garage des Anwesens am 8. November dieses Jahres, verfolgen die Ermittler der Kripo nun eine heiße Spur.

Die Fährte der mutmaßlichen Täter führt nach Brandenburg vor die Tore Berlins. Dort wurde der Porsche Panamera drei Tage nach dem Einbruch verlassen, aber mit noch laufendem Motor in einem Gewerbegebiet in Kleinmanchow aufgefunden. Vorangegangen war eine Verfolgungsfahrt der Autobahnpolizei. Den Beamten war der auffällige Wagen bei einem Kontrollversuch auf der A 115 in Richtung Berlin entwischt.

Seit dem Auffinden des Fahrzeugs und dessen Rückgabe an seine Besitzer konnten die Ermittlungen der Kripo Offenburg intensiviert werden. Der Chauffeur des Autos hatte während seiner Flucht über die Autobahnen der Republik und vor seinem Verschwinden Spuren hinterlassen - er wurde auf seiner eiligen Fahrt in Richtung Osten von der Kamera einer Geschwindigkeitsüberwachungsanlage auf der A 10 kurz vor Berlin fotografiert.

Die Ermittler hoffen mit der Veröffentlichung eines Fotos des verdächtigen Fahrers, weitere wichtige Hinweise zu seiner Person und möglichen Mittätern zu erhalten. Es wird nicht ausgeschlossen, dass der zurückliegende Einbruch mit weiteren gleichgelagerten Wohnungseinbrüchen zwischen Oberkirch und Baden-Baden in Verbindung steht.

Wem ist die abgebildete Person oder der braune Porsche Panamera am 8. November in Lauf, oder den Tagen danach im Bereich Bühl oder Bühlertal aufgefallen? Dort wurde der Wagen am Nachmittag und späten Abend des 10. November von Zeugen in der Hägenichstraße gesehen. Zudem konnten auf einem Waldweg unterhalb des Wiedefelsens unweit der L 83 Gegenstände aufgefunden werden, die sich zuvor in dem entwendenden Auto befunden hatten. Auch in Forbach-Bermersbach könnte der Unbekannte gesehen worden sein, dort entwendeten die Täter vor ihrer Fahrt in Richtung Osten noch zwei Kennzeichen und brachten sie an dem Porsche an.

Hinweise werden an die Telefonnummer: 0781 21-2620 erbeten.

Ante esta situaci�n ha encargado a la propia S�nchez Camacho que se ponga en contacto con el resto de formaciones pol�ticas para ver �si el ordenamiento y las normas que tenemos son suficientes y c�mo podemos hacer para acabar con el anonimato�. Un anonimato que, seg�n Hernando, �es la barrera en la que se escudan algunos para actuar de forma cobarde e impune y perpretar este tipo de actividades, que considero que son delictivas�.

Actualmente, ha explicado el portavoz del PP en el Congreso, el procedimiento tras una denuncia implica que se tiene que poner en funcionamiento una unidad de la Polic�a o de la Guardia Civil, que tiene que intentar averiguar qui�n se esconde detr�s de ese anonimato. Un proceso �largo que retrasa el castigo�.

De ah� que los populares hayan decidido ponerse �a trabajar en ello y ver si somos capaces de evitar este tipo de cosas en un futuro�.

Para ello hay que implicar a las propias empresas de estas redes sociales, ya que Rafael Hernando ha reclamado que detr�s de cada pseud�nimo tiene que haber una �identidad clara�. �As� acabaremos tambi�n con la utilizaci�n de robots que pretenden dar la apariencia de una gran presencia de opiniones y luego derivan en la propagaci�n de mentiras o de acoso�, ha dicho el popular, que ha apelado a la responsabilida social de estas compa��as.

El portavoz parlamentario se ha mostrado confiado en poder llegar a un acuerdo al respecto con el resto de grupos e, incluso, de que este asunto se aborde en Europa.

Rafael Hernando ha hecho estas declaraciones junto a la mencionada Alicia S�nchez Camacho, que esta misma ma�ana ha presentado una denuncia ante la Polic�a para que se investigue en los juzgados un tuit amenazante con la siguiente frase: �A ti te tendr�a que haber encontrado 'La Manada'�.

1646,3,1.0,"Lidar Just Got Way Better—But It’s Still Too Expensive for Your Car

Velodyne’s latest sensor doubles the company’s previous mark for range and quadruples its resolution. But it’s entering an increasingly competitive field.

The iconic spinning laser sensors atop autonomous cars may be making their final turns. Velodyne, the world’s market-leading lidar manufacturer, has built a new device that sees further and in more detail than any lidar sensor currently on sale, in a package a fifth the size of its previous high-resolution device.

Lidar sensors, which bounce laser beams off nearby objects to create highly accurate 3-D maps of their surroundings, are an important component for most self-driving cars. Until now, the pick of the commercially available crop has been Velodyne’s HDL-64E—a coffee-can-size lump that fires 64 laser beams, one atop the other, as it spins in circles. Each beam is separated from the next by an angle of 0.4°, with a range of 120 meters.

But those specifications aren’t enough to help vehicles at high speed in unpredictable situations. A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour would have just four seconds to respond to an obstacle. The angular resolution is also too low to make out an object that’s far away, because the laser beams will be too spread out to return a viable image. As a result, many autonomous cars use data from other sensors to help recognize obstacles, even if they have lidar sensors on board.

“The consensus is pretty clear,” Austin Russell, CEO of rival lidar manufacturer Luminar and one of our 35 Innovators under 35 of 2017, told MIT Technology Review earlier this year. “You need a lidar that can see out past 200 meters. You also need to be able to see ... not just that there’s an object out there, but what it is.”

Such concerns have pushed the world’s most advanced driverless-car projects to build their own lidar systems. Two of them, Waymo and Uber, are currently embroiled in a heated lawsuit centered on stolen trade secrets related to their in-house devices.

Now, Velodyne has launched a sensor called VLS-128 that it hopes will satisfy the demand for increased performance. The new device uses 128 laser beams, twice as many as its predecessor. The firm’s chief technical officer, Anand Gopalan, told MIT Technology Review that those beams are separated by angles as small as 0.1°, with a range of 300 meters, and create as many as four million data points per second as they spin through 360 degrees. The increase in resolution, says Gopalan, will provide such detail that cars won’t need other sensors for obstacle detection—though they probably will still carry other sensors in the interests of redundancy and safety.

Ingmar Posner, an associate professor of information engineering at the University of Oxford and founder of the university’s autonomous-driving spinoff Oxbotica, says the increase in performance is “awesome.” He agrees that it should allow vehicles to detect objects more reliably using lidar data, and believes it would enable driverless cars to cope better in faster-moving environments.

For once, though, Velodyne is starting to see competition. Russell’s startup, Luminar, has developed its own mechanical lidar system, which uses a single mirror to steer a powerful laser in order to see 250 meters, with beams separated by as little as 0.05° (see “College Dropout Says He’s Cracked Self-Driving Cars’ Most Crucial Component”). And other firms, such as Aeva, are experimenting with systems that blend lidar and radar approaches, to push range and resolution even further.

Still, Velodyne has more experience with actually building and selling such devices, and it says it will ship units of the VLS-128 before 2017 is out. Gopalan wouldn’t say whether its customers included firms that were building their own alternatives, such as Waymo and Uber, explaining only that he would “expect this sensor to meet the needs of any autonomous-vehicle program in the industry, either current or in the future.”

For now, big companies may be the only ones able to afford the sensor. Gopalan wouldn’t say how much it will cost at first, explaining only that it could cost “thousands of dollars” when it enters mass production, though it’s not clear when that will happen. But the device’s predecessor, the HDL-64E, is not mass-produced and costs $80,000 per unit. Gopalan would say, however, that the new sensor will probably be installed in robotic taxis and autonomous trucks at first.

Russell shares that sentiment. “Some of the companies in the ride-sharing space have said that if you had an autonomous car that just worked, they’d be willing to purchase these cars for $300,000 to $400,000 apiece and buy as many as you could possibly make,” he says. That’s because the total vehicle cost—and, therefore, the price of sensors—is less important than it is in a consumer car, because a steep investment could be recouped quickly by keeping a vehicle on the road nearly 24 hours a day.

Meanwhile, many firms, including Velodyne, are busy building low-cost, solid-state lidar sensors for autonomous vehicles. But in truth, they lack the range and resolution required for high-speed driving (see “Low-Quality Lidar Will Keep Self-Driving Cars in the Slow Lane”). Gopalan agrees. He imagines seeing such devices used as driver aids in consumer vehicles, or to augment expensive sensors in fully autonomous vehicles.

1647,3,1.0,"Almost half of financial planning staff at US universities believe that the current business model at their institution is “not sustainable for the next five to 10 years”, according to new research.

A survey of 183 US higher education professionals who are involved in the financial planning and budgeting process at their institution found that 47 per cent of respondents thought that their business model was unsustainable.

This figure rises to more than 50 per cent when just based on respondents from two-year community colleges and for-profit universities, and drops to about 45 per cent for respondents from both public and non-profit private four-year universities, according to Tony Ard, vice-president of higher education software at Chicago-based management consulting firm Kaufman Hall, which conducted the study.

Meanwhile, two-thirds of respondents (66 per cent) said that they are not able to respond quickly to changing financial circumstances or are unsure if they could, based on existing tools and processes at their institution. A similar proportion (64 per cent) believed that higher education was behind most other industries in terms of “adopting modern financial planning practices and tools”.

More than two-fifths of respondents (43 per cent) said that the current length of the budget cycle limits their ability to make informed decisions and react to changing circumstances; 82 per cent of respondents said that their budgeting cycle takes more than three months to complete from initial rollout to board presentation, while 34 per cent said that it takes more than six months.

The survey was conducted in August and September 2017.

Mr Ard said that the findings confirm that there is a “growing recognition from people within higher education, and specifically in finance offices, that at the micro-level we probably can’t grow our way out of these financial challenges”.

He said that the unsustainability of universities’ business models was because of “flat demographic trends around high school graduates”, a drop in state appropriation to public universities and the “challenges with growing tuition revenue”.

“There has been a lot of scrutiny on published tuition rates” and there have been questions over the “average family’s ability and willingness to pay what it perceives as a high tuition rate”, Mr Ard said.

He added that it is “not that easy” for universities to “influence their costs in the short run because it’s pretty much tied up in people and facilities”.

Mr Ard said that while institutions with “very strong brand names will be fine”, there are risks that more universities will close or merge as a result of their financial challenges.

1654,1,,"El antiguo partido de ultraderecha  Fuerza Nueva, reconvertido ahora en asociación, celebró este martes un  acto de homenaje a Francisco Franco en la localidad cordobesa de Lucena y lo hizo precisamente en el cementerio de la localidad, donde actualmente se excava una  fosa donde se encuentran los restos de 123 represaliados republicanos asesinados durante la guerra civil. Los hechos, que fueron autorizados por la Subdelegación del Gobierno y conocidos por el Ayuntamiento de la localidad, han sido  denunciados ante la Fiscalía.

Según consta en la solicitud de autorización a la Subdelegación del Gobierno de Córdoba a la que ha tenido acceso  eldiario.es/andalucia, Fuerza Nueva comunicó su intención de realizar el acto de exaltación de Franco el pasado 16 de noviembre. En su escrito señalaban los actos que iban a realizar  “con motivo de la conmemoración de un nuevo aniversario del fallecimiento del Generalísimo Franco y del fusilamiento de José Antonio Primo de Rivera”.

Así, se comunicaba que se haría una “ofrenda de una corona en la Cruz de los Caídos” del cementerio de Nuestra Señora de Araceli -donde se encuentra la fosa de los represaliados franquistas-, además de celebrar una misa en la Ermita de Nuestra Señora de la Aurora.

Los hechos han sido denunciados ante la Fiscalía y el juzgado de guardia por el partido ‘Andalucía, entre todos’,  haciendo extensiva la denuncia al subdelegado del Gobierno en Córdoba, Juan José Primo Jurado, por “permitir” el homenaje a Franco, “por su inacción e incumplimiento de la Ley de Memoria Histórica”.

En su denuncia a la Fiscalía de Córdoba, según ha podido comprobar este medio, se expone el acto llevado a cabo en el cementerio de Lucena por parte de la junta regional de Fuerza Nueva, “lo que incurre en  incumplimiento de lo establecido en la Ley de Memoria Histórica”, por lo que los hechos se han puesto en conocimiento del fiscal “por su hubiera lugar a diligencias y acciones en el supuesto de que se haya incurrido, como así se entiende, en incumplimientos legales”.

Así, la denuncia se realiza contra Fuerza Nueva y el representante de esta organización que firma la comunicación del acto a Subdelegación del Gobierno, pero también a la persona del subdelegado del Gobierno en la provincia cordobesa. Desde la Subdelegación se ha señalado que el acto estaba ""autorizado conforme a la ley"" y que ""cumplía con lo legalmente establecido"". En este sentido, remarcan que el homenaje se comunicó como ""cualquier otra manifestación o acto"" que requiere de permiso de la Subdelegación de Gobierno y ""se autorizó"" al ""cumplir con la legalidad"".

Por su parte,  Izquierda Unida ha anunciado que  llevará el asunto al Parlamento de Andalucía para preguntar en esta cámara si los actos de exaltación del dictador han vulnerado la Ley de Memoria Histórica andaluza, que prohíbe cualquier acto de exaltación franquista.

La celebración de este homenaje a Franco también fue puesta en conocimiento del Ayuntamiento de Lucena, si bien no tomó ninguna decisión al respecto y el acto se pudo llevar a cabo sin ninguna cortapisa. Cabe recordar que en 2015, Lucena también fue protagonista de un acto de exaltación franquista cuando en sus calles se desarrolló una caravana de medio centenar de vehículos que recorrieron el municipio con banderas franquistas conmemorando el golpe de estado del dictador el 18 de julio.

Dolors Montserrat, el lunes en Bruselas, poco antes de la reunión de la UE que descartó a Barcelona como sede de la EMA.

Son tan burdas las mentiras del independentismo catalán que desenmascararlas es ya un juego de niños. La última que ha intentado colar para la causa es culpar a la “violencia del Estado” del 1 de octubre pasado y a la aplicación del artículo 155 de la decisión de la Unión Europea de dejar fuera a Barcelona como sede de la Agencia Europea del Medicamento (EMA). El procés, dicen sus dirigentes, no habría sido la razón de la espantada. Tal argumento lo desmiente el sentido común, pero también los hechos.

El 2 de mayo pasado, la ministra de Sanidad Dolors Montserrat, el consejero de Salud Antoni Comín y el ex segundo teniente de alcalde de Barcelona Jaume Collboni se reunieron en Londres con los trabajadores de la EMA y ahí ya se percibió la preocupación por el reto independentista. Interpelado por ello, Comín tranquilizó a los empleados asegurándoles que Cataluña seguiría formando parte de la UE y que la agencia no corría peligro en caso de trasladarse a Barcelona. Algunos le abuchearon.

El 19 de julio, el director de la EMA, Guido Rasi, desayunó en Barcelona, entre otros, con el vicepresidente Oriol Junqueras y la ministra. La candidatura catalana era técnicamente impecable, pero Rasi confesó que era difícil de digerir que la EMA aterrizara en una Cataluña que quería cambiar su statu quo cuando esta abandonaba el Reino Unido justamente por su deseo de cambiar ese statu quo respecto a la UE. Junqueras le aseguró que pasara lo que pasara el 1-O todo sería negociado y acordado con el Gobierno español. Rasi no quedó satisfecho y aconsejó a los españoles que hicieran más visible su unidad de criterio. Pero Junqueras se negó a la propuesta de Montserrat de hacerlo en plena campaña secesionista reuniendo en Barcelona a Mariano Rajoy, Carles Puigdemont y Ada Colau. Así lo cuentan testigos de todo el proceso y así lo relató un periódico catalán en su momento sin que fuera desmentido.

Desde mediados de agosto estaba cantada la derrota de Barcelona y se temía que el riguroso trabajo de las tres administraciones (Gobierno central, Generalitat y Ayuntamiento de Barcelona) durante meses no fuera recompensado. Pero el lunes, cuando la UE descartó Barcelona, el expreisdente Puigdemont y su consejero Comín, conocedores del proceso de selección y de las preocupaciones reales de los implicados, echaron la culpa desde su exilio en Bruselas a “las porras del ministro Zoido” el 1-O y aseguraron que hasta ese día Barcelona era la favorita.

Así, de farsa en farsa, muchos políticos independentistas han construido su quimera destruyendo la credibilidad de Cataluña. Se niega la evidencia, se manipula la realidad y se defienden los intereses propios a través de performances en el Congreso a cargo del saltimbanqui Gabriel Rufián. Hace años, Cataluña era el destino soñado de miles de europeos. Hoy, una agencia comunitaria huye despavorida. Pero no hay más ciego que el que no quiere ver y para esta dolencia no hay medicamento que valga.

La definición de genocidio de la Corte Penal Internacional

Ciertamente, la conquista y evangelización de América tuvo sus luces y sus sombras, pero la realidad histórica dista mucho de la famosa “leyenda negra” creada por británicos y holandeses y hoy promovida por ultraizquierdistas. Los hechos históricos dejan claro que no se puede hablar, ni remotamente, de un genocidio español en América, y cuando digo “genocidio” me refiero a la definición del mismo que hacen el Estatuto de Roma de la Corte Penal Internacional en su Art. 6:

A los efectos del presente Estatuto, se entenderá por “genocidio” cualquiera de los actos mencionados a continuación, perpetrados con la intención de destruir total o parcialmente a un grupo nacional, étnico, racial o religioso como tal:

a) Matanza de miembros del grupo;

b) Lesión grave a la integridad física o mental de los miembros del grupo;

c) Sometimiento intencional del grupo a condiciones de existencia que hayan de acarrear su destrucción física, total o parcial;

d) Medidas destinadas a impedir nacimientos en el seno del grupo;

e) Traslado por la fuerza de niños del grupo a otro grupo.

Las leyes españolas protegiendo a los indígenas

La ultraizquierda sostiene hoy que España se propuso aniquilar a los indios, una afirmación absurda. Recordemos que en 1512, ante las primeras noticias de maltratos a los indios, el Rey Fernando II firmó las Leyes de Burgos que consideraban “hombres libres” a los indios  y la obligación de pagarles un salario justo por su trabajo. En 1542 el Emperador Carlos V dictó las Leyes Nuevas, que prohibían expresamente someter a los indios a esclavitud y a trabajos forzosos. A esto hay que añadir que entre la población española y los indios hubo un gran mestizaje, incluso entre los nobles. Por el contrario, en la Norteamérica británica el mestizaje entre colonos e indios fue casi inexistente, y a los indígenas se les arrebataron sus tierras y se les confinó en reservas, cosa que no ocurrió en la América española.

España fundó en América 23 universidades abiertas a los indígenas

La labor educativa de España en el Nuevo Mundo fue notable. En 1533 los españoles fundaron el Colegio de la Santa Cruz en Tlatelolco, en Nueva España (actual México), que fue la primera institución de educación superior de toda América, y en 1538 se fundó la primera universidad de América, en Santo Domingo. Tengamos en cuenta que hay países europeos que tardaron más tiempo en tener universidades. Y eso fue solo el comienzo. España fundó 23 universidades en América, abiertas a personas de todas las razas. Por el contrario, en la Norteamérica británica no hubo ningún centro de enseñanza superior hasta el Harvard College en 1636 (para entonces la América hispana ya contaba con 13 universidades), convertido en universidad en 1780 y en el que no pudieron cursar estudios alumnos no blancos hasta bien entrado el siglo XIX. Portugal fundó la primera universidad de Brasil en 1808.

Dos lenguas indígenas que alcanzaron su máxima expansión bajo el Imperio español

Otro aspecto a destacar es el lingüístico. Aunque la Corona recomendó educar a los indios en español para facilitar el entendimiento con ellos, dada la multitud de lenguas amerindias que había, la labor misionera y educativa de España en América se tradujo en la conservación de lenguas precolombinas. En 1580 el Rey Felipe II ordenó la creación de cátedras para lenguas indígenas en las universidades de Lima y México y en las ciudades con Real Audiencia. Dos lenguas surgidas en el siglo V D. C., el náhuatl, idioma del Imperio azteca, y el quechua, idioma del Imperio inca, alcanzaron de hecho su mayor expansión durante el Imperio español, gracias a los misioneros. Hay que tener en cuenta, además, que en las universidades de la América española se impartían el latín muchas de las asignaturas, además de enseñarse otras lenguas. Obviamente, el español acabó siendo el idioma más hablado por ser la lengua vehicular del Imperio y porque las lenguas precolombinas acabaron transcribiéndose con el alfabeto español. Hoy Hispanoamérica tiene una lengua común en la que se entienden entre sí más de 400 millones de personas, pero a la vez se han conservado lenguas precolombinas. Hay que tener en cuenta que le primera imprenta de la América española se instaló en México en 1535. Ya desde el siglo XVI se imprimieron diversas obras en lenguas indígenas (náhuatl, quechua, aymara, puquina…), que figuran entre los textos más antiguos en esas lenguas.

Las epidemias y el desastre demográfico de Hispanoamérica

Los datos que acabo de exponer echan por tierra la tesis de que España se propuso la aniquilación de los indios precolombinos. Por supuesto, sí que hubo muertes. Los españoles combatieron contra algunos pueblos indígenas, como el Imperio azteca, contando como aliados con otros indígenas, como los totonacas y los tlaxcaltecas, enemigos de los aztecas y que siempre mantuvieron una buena relación con los conquistadores. Gracias a esas alianzas con pueblos indígenas los españoles, muy inferiores en número (en 1700 no eran más de 250.000 en toda la América española), lograron dominar un territorio enorme en mucho menos tiempo del que le llevó a los británicos controlar Norteamérica en 200 años con mucha más gente. No obstante, las plagas provocaron un desastre demográfico en la América española, causando el 95% de las muertes de ese periodo. No fue, de ninguna forma, un hecho provocado por los conquistadores, que a menudo se vieron sorprendidos por la enorme mortandad de los indígenas a causa de las enfermedades traídas por los españoles. Esa mortandad se debió a que el sistema inmune de los indígenas estaba más indefenso frente a ciertas enfermedades (viruela, gripe, sarampión, la peste bubónica, la difteria, el tifus o la escarlatina) que ya había asolado Europa siglos atrás, haciendo relativamente inmune a su población. El aislamiento geográfico de los indios provocó que se viesen diezmados por enfermedades sin efectos letales para los europeos.

Torre de calaveras en Tenochtitlán, con los restos de hombres, mujeres y niños víctimas de los sacrificios humanos en el Imperio azteca

Salen a la luz las pruebas del genocidio perpetrado por los aztecas

Algunos intentan presentar esto como un “genocidio”, y lo hacen tergiversando por completo la definición del mismo y hasta culpando a Dios de haberlo cometido. Muestra de ello es un artículo publicado por la revista ultraizquierdista argentina Página 12 en 2010, afirmando que esas enfermedades fueron “un dardo envenenado asociado a la cruz y la espada. Una ayudita que el pequeño dios europeo, insigne en su maldad, les daba a sus sicarios.“ Presentar esas plagas como obra de un “dios europeo” que quería ayudar a los españoles a exterminar a los indios es un ejemplo claro de fanatismo ideológico llevado a los extremos más ridículos. En esos mismos círculos se echa de menos una visión más crítica sobre lo que hacían ciertos pueblos amerindios. Hace unos meses fueron descubiertas una torre de cráneos en Tenochtitlán, un monstruoso monumento azteca del que ya dio testimonio Andrés de Tapia, acompañante de Hernán Cortés, en 1521. Muchos tacharon aquel testimonio como una mentira para justificar la lucha de los conquistadores contra los aztecas, pero al final la arqueología ha demostrado que era cierto.

Hasta 100.000 sacrificios humanos al año en el Imperio azteca

En una carta fechada en 1524, Fray Juan de Zumarraga, primer Obispo de México, señalaba que en Tenochtitlán sacrificaban a sus ídolos a más de 20.000 personas cada año y a más de 72.000 en todo el Imperio azteca, entre ellos 20.000 niños. El historiador mexicano Mariano Cuevas (1879-1949) cifró esos sacrificios en 20.000 anuales en Tenochtitlán, y señaló que “nos quedamos cortos” si ciframos en 100.000 sacrificios anuales los perpetrados en todo el Anáhuac, nombre dado por los aztecas al territorio que ocupada su imperio. Así mismo, en el primer volumen de su “Historia de la iglesia en Mexico”, Cuevas señalaba: “En las vigas y gradas de Mixcoatl, edificio del templo mayor de México, contaron Andrés de Tapia y Gonzalo de Umbría 136.000 calaveras de indios sacrificados.” En la misma obra señala que “los méxicas y vecinos aliados vivían en continuas guerras con otros pueblos guerreros, guerras que tenían por exclusivo objeto el cautivar el mayor número posible de sus contrarios para después sacrificarlos.”

En su película “Apocalypto” (2006), Mel Gibson escenificó los sacrificios humanos en el Imperio maya

Unas monstruosas prácticas que también hacían otros pueblos precolombinos

Mariano Cuevas señala que los aztecas mezclaban los sacrificios humanos de cautivos y esclavos con las prácticas de canibalismo con los cadáveres de los asesinados, después de extraerles el corazón y decapitarles. Era una auténtica orgía de sangre. El historiador mexicano relata la narración de un sacrificio hecho en 1487 -décadas antes de la conquista de México por los españoles- en un manuscrito azteca, que relata una ceremonia pagana en la que durante cuatro días, “desde la mañana hasta la puesta del sol”, fueron sacrificados “ochenta mil y cuatro cientos hombres de diversas provincias y ciudades”. Cuevas explica que los aztecas no eran los únicos que cometían estas horrendas prácticas. Entre los pueblos amerindios que también hacían sacrificios humanos cita a los tarascos, los mayas, los zapotecas y los matlacingas. Hoy sabemos, por los estudios arqueológicos, que también cometían estas monstruosidades los incas, los olmecas, los teotihuacanos, los toltecas, los totonacas, los mochicas y los muiscas.

En 1521 los españoles pusieron fin a esas prácticas genocidas, asociadas a las religiones paganas precolombinas. La evangelización de América hizo que los indios asumiesen una nueva forma de pensar en la que todos los hombres eran hijos de Dios y por tanto hermanos. Sin embargo, hoy la ultraizquierda y ciertos movimientos indigenistas asociados a ella intentan blanquear a los autores de esas monstruosidades, tapando esos sacrificios humanos y presentando a sus perpetradores como heroicos miembros de una resistencia contra el imperialismo español y contra la Iglesia Católica. Una propaganda basada en una burda falsificación de la historia.

1658,1,,"Em pleno dia da Consciência Negra, data em que milhares de negras e negros foram às ruas para reivindicar o fim do racismo e políticas públicas para a população preta, Laerte Rimoli, presidente da EBC, a Empresa Brasileira de Comunicação, utilizou suas redes sociais para compartilhar postagens com mensagens racistas direcionadas à atriz Taís Araújo e a seu filho.

O post faz relação às declarações de Araújo, que dias antes havia proferido uma palestra no evento TEDxSãoPaulo, onde afirmou que “a cor de seu filho é a cor que faz com que as pessoas mudem de calçada, escondam suas bolsas e que blindem seus carros”.

Para Guilherme Dias, membro da Cojira (Comissão de Jornalistas pela Igualdade Racial do Sindicato dos Jornalistas de São Paulo), a atitude do presidente da EBC é “condenável”.

""É um absurdo. É condenável uma pessoa que ocupa o cargo que ele ocupa, se permitir ‘brincar’ com uma questão que é tão grave, que é o racismo. Esse tipo de atitude, de tratar isso como piada, e de reverter uma situação de que os negros são vítimas, para colocá-los como culpados desses atos racistas, é comum"", ressalta Dias.

Ele lembra ainda que o código ética da Empresa Brasileira de Comunicação, deixa claro que atitudes como esta são passíveis de punição: ""Aqui, em um rápido acesso ao código de ética da empresa, ela diz, em um dos artigos, que o servidor jamais poderá desprezar o elemento ético da sua conduta. De qualquer forma, como ele dirige uma empresa jornalística, ele precisa responder por isso"".

O Fórum Nacional pela Democratização da Comunicação (FNDC) afirmou que entrará com uma representação no Ministério Público Federal para apurar crime de racismo e também avalia uma representação perante o Comitê de Ética Pública da Presidência da República, ao qual membros da administração estão submetidos.

De acordo com Bia Barbosa, as postagens são da maior seriedade, principalmente pela questão simbólica de ter sido feita no Dia da Consciência Negra e logo após o caso do apresentador William Waack, que proferiu declarações racistas em gravação na Rede Globo.

""O FNDC entende que esse é um caso seríssimo e que levaria à justificação de um afastamento, de uma demissão do presidente do EBC. A gente ainda tem um desafio muito grande do ponto de vista do jornalismo, para combater o racismo na nossa sociedade.""

De acordo com Joel Zito Araújo, ex-membro do Conselho Curador da EBC e doutor em Ciências da comunicação pela Escola de Comunicações e Artes da Universidade de São Paulo, Rimoli é a expressão da onda que nós vivemos no Brasil hoje. ""Não me surpreende que ele ironize a declaração de Taís Araújo. Eu considero o Laerte Rimoli não um presidente, eu considero ele um interventor. Na verdade, ele tem uma trajetória de interventor, pelo fato de ele ser parte do grupo político do Eduardo Cunha"", ressalta.

Zito lembra que Rimoli foi nomeado presidente da EBC após uma medida provisória. Ele substituiu o jornalista Ricardo Melo, exonerado em maio de 2016, logo após a nomeação interina de Temer na Presidência da República.

Melo ainda retornou ao cargo depois de uma liminar do Supremo Tribunal Federal, já que o estatuto previa mandato fixo para a diretoria da EBC. No entanto, a MP de Temer alterou o texto, permitindo a nomeação de Rimoli no comando da estatal.

O ex-conselheiro disse ainda que a nomeação de Rimoli é o símbolo do golpe contra a presidenta Dilma Rousseff, proferido por Michel Temer, do PMDB.

""Ele faz parte da desestruturação do Brasil, das instituições democráticas brasileiras que veio com o golpe. Ele é um dos interventores, ele é um dos prepostos disso. E portanto, eu acho que ele está cumprindo seu papel, dessa minoria que tomou o país no golpe, que criou esse caos que nós estamos vivendo, político, econômico e institucional.""

Nesta quarta-feira, Rimoli utilizou as redes sociais para se desculpar. “Peço desculpas à atriz Taís Araújo e sua família por ter compartilhado um post inadequado em minha timeline.”

A reportagem do Brasil de Fato entrou em contato com a EBC para saber o posicionamento da empresa sobre o caso e quais as possíveis punições ao presidente, mas até o fechamento desta matéria, não obteve resposta.

1662,1,,"O relator da reforma da Previdência, deputado Arthur Oliveira Maia (PPS-BA), vai divulgar o novo texto do projeto nesta quarta-feira (22).

O deputado vai apresentar uma versão mais enxuta da Proposta de Emenda Constitucional (PEC) que estabelece mudanças nas regras previdenciárias.

Sem força política e com a perda da base apoiadora para aprovar o texto inicial da reforma, o anúncio vai ser feito após o jantar que será oferecido pelo presidente golpista, Michel Temer (PMDB), aos deputados da base aliada, no Palácio da Alvorada.

Nos bastidores, avalia-se que governo não tem os 308 votos necessários para aprovar a proposta. Por isso, o texto de Oliveira Maia vai retirar alguns pontos sensíveis, como a inclusão dos trabalhadores rurais na reforma.

O texto deve alterar três pontos do sistema previdenciário atual. A reforma prevê a implantação de idade mínima de aposentadoria de 65 anos para homens e 62 para as mulheres; a definição de uma regra de transição para os servidores públicos e a equiparação do sistema público e privado de Previdência para o teto do benefício.

Para movimentos populares e especialistas no tema, mesmo com as alterações, a proposta continua sendo excludente.

O governo e a base aliada esperam votar a PEC até o dia 15 de dezembro na Câmara dos Deputados. O presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia, do DEM, do Rio de Janeiro, afirmou, nesta terça-feira, que só vai colocar a reforma da Previdência quando tiver os votos necessários para a aprovação da medida.

A proposta volta ao Congresso Nacional após ter ficado mais de seis meses paralisada devido às delações de empresários da JBS envolvendo Temer em supostos casos de corrupção passiva.

1664,1,,"Esta reportagem é parte da série sobre a indústria da delação premiada da Lava Jato, um projeto de crowdfunding feito em parceria entre o DCM e o JornalGGN. As demais estão aqui

Na matéria anterior desta série, destacamos que o trabalho de João Santana e Mônica Moura fazia parte de um pacote que era oferecido pela Odebrecht a candidatos a presidente.

A empreiteira se aproximava e oferecia um coquetel saboroso: os marqueteiros que ajudaram o PT a conquistar o poder, o financiamento da campanha e o levantamento de grandes obras que passariam a fazer parte da plataforma dos candidatos.

Eleitos, havia a garantia de que as obras seriam construídas, com financiamento do BNDES. A Lava Jato mudou o foco da delação dos dois: da Obebrecht para Dilma Rousseff e Lula.

Entre os documentos reunidos pela CPMI da JBS, aparecem algumas planilhas constantes dos acordos de delação premiada da Odebrecht e do casal de publicitários. Seriam as planilhas da contabilidade paralela da empreiteira, disponível no sistema My Web Day, criado e usado pela Odebrecht durante mais de uma década, mas que, hoje, é mantido sob sigilo pelo juiz Sergio Moro.

Nessas planilhas, aparecem pagamentos a João Santana e Mônica Moura feitas em contas da Suíça abertas em nome da offshore (empresa de paraíso fiscal) Shellbill. A soma dos valores depositados é de $ 4.825.000,00. Na mesma planilha, há registros de outras transferências, mas não é possível saber quem é o beneficiário. Por decisão da Justiça, os registros foram tarjados.

Na viagem que os deputados Paulo Pimenta e Wadih Damous fizeram a Madri, na Espanha, onde se encontraram com o advogado Rodrigo Tacla Durán, eles trouxeram na bagagem algumas cópias de planilhas muito parecidas, versões do mesmo sistema de contabilidade. Só que sem tarja.

Confrontando as duas, na parte onde não há tarja, é possível verificar que são quase idênticas. A única diferença é que, nas planilhas obtidas em Madri, os valores são em reais (é grafado o R antes do cifrão). Nas planilhas em poder de Tacla Durán, há contas vinculadas a João Santana e Mônica Moura que foram omitidas no acordo de delação premiada homologado no Brasil.

A resposta foi dada aos deputados que integram a CPMI da JBS, no depoimento gravado que prestou. O deputado federal Wadih Damous, que é advogado e já presidiu a seção da OAB no Rio de Janeiro, perguntou a respeito de uma conta aberta pelo Deltora — segundo reportagem publicada pela Folha de S. Paulo, João Santana omitiu a conta na sua delação a Moro.

Damous — Deltora é vinculada a quem?

Damous — E essa conta, Deltora, ela não aparece na delação da Mônica Moura e João Santana?

Tacla Durán — Não que eu tenha tomado conhecimento. Tudo que eu li, no que foi público, não vi nada mencionando.

Tacla Durán — Shellbill faz parte de uma planilha que me pediram para fazer um estudo e buscar os beneficiários finais.

Pimenta — E, além da Shellbill, apareceu outra conta nesse estudo da planilha?

Tacla Durán — Sim. A Deltora e mais duas, uma pessoa física e outra pessoa jurídica.

Tacla Durán — Sim, essa conta era de contas vinculadas a pessoa de João Santana.

Pimenta — E na delação aparece só a Shellbill.

Tacla Durán — Até hoje eu só vi a Shellbill.

Tacla Durán prestou serviços para a Odebrecht entre 2011 e 2016. Sua atuação se concentrava no Departamento de Operações Estruturadas, o setor da Odebrecht que fazia pagamentos que a empresa não queria vincular àcontabilidade oficial — o que inclui propina.

Sua intimidade com o Departamento de Operações Estruturadas era tanta que o apartamento em que o diretor Hilberto Silva morava pertencia a Tacla Durán. O advogado recebia cerca de R$ 10 mil, pagos pela Odebrecht, conforme consta de sua declaração de imposto de renda.

Tacla Durán disse que recebeu da Odebrecht a tarefa de analisar as planilhas com pagamentos a João Santana e Mônica Moura, e descobriu que havia quatro contas vinculadas a eles. O objetivo da empresa, segundo o advogado, era descobrir algo nas movimentações bancárias de João Santana que pudesse comprometer Dilma Rousseff. Mas ele só conseguiu chegar até certo ponto.

“Quando eu não consegui localizar o beneficiário final das contas e relatei isso ao Hilberto, ele ficou muito chateado, porque, aí sim, ele me colocou que era o pagamento ao João Santana, que era muito importante a gente conseguir isso, porque a ideia da Odebrecht era pressionar a presidente Dilma, através dessa informação, a paralisar as investigações ou coisas nesse sentido”, afirmou o advogado.

Segundo ele, a Odebrecht já tinha feito encomendas muito parecidas, para descobrir o caminho do dinheiro em outros países, comprometer as autoridades e interromper investigações. Na entrevista que deu ao jornal El País, da Espanha, Tacla Durán contou que a empresa usava também outros expedientes para pressionar políticos. Guardava em arquivo fotos de autoridades de países da América Central comemorando eleições com prostitutas, inclusive mulheres levadas do Brasil.

Essas fotos nunca vieram a público, mas Tacla Durán diz que tem cópia de algumas delas, repassadas a ele por diretores da Odebrecht, que também lhe mostraram o chiclete de viagra, igual ao que costumavam dar de presente a autoridades dos países onde essas festas eram realizadas.

Odebrecht mantinha as fotos como trunfo, num jogo arriscado. Segundo Durán, a empresa ajudava os candidatos com dinheiro e serviços de marketing político (João Santana) e precisava de algo para usar em caso de ser passada para trás e ficar sem os projetos que queria realizar. Ou seja, caso fosse excluída do orçamento público, de onde, afinal, vem o dinheiro que enriquecia a empresa e as autoridades.

João Santana e a mulher, Mônica Moura, eram peças dessa engrenagem que funcionou durante décadas. Além de comandar o marketing político, eles eram veículos para a transferência de dinheiro. Tacla Durán soube disso quando analisou as planilhas do My Web Day. Pelas contas de Santana e de Mônica passaram pagamentos a terceiros, até agora não identificados, como um tal Nicolas Sawne Barake.

As declarações e os documentos apresentados por Tacla Durán poderiam ser recebidos com desconfiança. Poderiam ser interpretados como a ação de um investigado em desespero para tentar desqualificar o processo em que é acusado de lavagem de dinheiro e formação de organização criminosa e, assim, tentar inviabilizaro trabalho da Justiça.

Mas, quando se olha para o resultado das colaborações prestadas por ele em outros países, a desconfiança diminui ou desaparece: Durán ajudou o Departamento de Justiça dos Estados Unidos com informações que levaram a administração de Barack Obama a viabilizar na Justiça um acordo que resultou na maior multa da história dos Estados Unidos aplicada em um caso estrangeiro de suborno:2,6 bilhões de dólares.

Isso explica por que Tacla Durán não foi preso em território americano, nos quatro meses que permaneceu lá depois que Sergio Moro decretou sua prisão no Brasil, no dia 5 de julho de 2016. Durán entrava e saía do Departamento de Justiça dos Estados Unidos, em Wahington, sem que fosse incomodado pela ordem de prisão assinado por Moro. Quando quis sair dos Estados Unidos e ir para a Espanha, passou pela imigração dos dois países sem nenhum problema.

Só foi preso no dia 18 de novembro, dois dias depois de chegar a Madri. Ele tomava café no saguão do Hotel Intercontinental quando policiais o prenderam. Havia um novo mandado de prisão, emitido na véspera, o quarto assinado por Moro contra Tacla Durán. Passou 78 dias no presídio Soto Del Real, um cárcere conhecido na Espanha por abrigar milionários e políticos acusados de crimes de sonegação e corrupção, como o ex-presidente do Barcelona, Sandro Rosell.

Uma vez preso, teve início o processo de extradição para o Brasil. A Justiça decidiu, em primeira instância, que ele deveria ser entregue às autoridades brasileiras. A Audiência Nacional, através de seu tribunal penal (a última instância), não permitiu. Tacla Durán é espanhol e, por decisão unânime, decidiu que ele não pode ser extraditado ao Brasil, ainda que, filho de espanhol, tenha também cidadania brasileira, por ter nascido em São Paulo.

A decisão da Audiência Nacional faculta ao Brasil a possibilidade de enviar o processo à Espanha para que lá, com base nas leis espanholas, possa ser julgado. Mas uma condenação na Espanha seria difícil com base nas provas juntadas pela Lava Jato contra ele. É que, na Espanha, delações não são levadas em consideração depois que se descobriu que o expediente foi usado para perseguir adversários, durante a ditadura do generalíssimo Franco.

Depois que foi recolhido ao presídio Sono Del Real, começou a ser foi ouvido também por autoridades de um país vizinho, o principado de Andorra, onde a Odebrecht concentrou parte de suas operações para corromper autoridades em todo o mundo. No principado, ele ajudou a sepultar a Banca Privada, uma instituição financeira que já tinha fechado depois de ser apontada, em 2014, como banco onde milionários norte-americanos lavaram dinheiro.

Durán era réu num processo por lavagem de dinheiro movido pelo principado, juntamente com Marcelo Odebrecht. Com sua colaboração, passou à condição de testemunha protegida e Marcelo continua processado. Tacla Durán prestará depoimento à CPMI do Congresso Nacional, através de videoconferência, no dia 30 de novembro. É a oportunidade que o Brasil terá de conhecer um pouco mais das estranhas da Odebrechet.

O que a empresa contou, através de seus executivos, já provocou o estrago. O que ela fez pode causar um terremoto ainda maior.

MEPs across political spectrum condemn Spain for having 'political prisoners'

Asking citizens is necessary, says European People's Party representative Franc Bogovic

Spain’s imprisonment of Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, and seven other elected ministers, as well as pro-independence civil leaders Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart, has been condemned as “unacceptable” by MEPs from across the political spectrum speaking to the Catalan News Agency (ACN).

MEP of the European People’s Party (EPP), and former Slovenian minister of agriculture, Franc Bogovic stated “it is unacceptable that political leaders are in jail.”

“The solution must be in the political sphere, not in prison,” he said, recalling that Junqueras and the other imprisoned Catalan ministers had taken “political actions.” The December 21 elections “will not be normal” if they remain behind bars, he added.

Spain’s imprisonment of the Catalan officials has been called “unfortunate” by Portuguese Socialist MEP, Ana Gomes. “I hope they are released soon,” she said.

Despite differences between both parties, with regard to their standing on the political spectrum, common ground was found between some members when it came to the situation in Catalonia.

Although Spain’s decision to incarcerate members of the Catalan government, as well as the presidents of ANC and Òmnium Cultural, was not formally debated in the European parliament, members of the ranks of each major party criticized the decisions of Spain’s high court judges, demanding that the state adopt a new strategy.

""The solution must be in the political sphere, not in prison""

Bogovic, whose party is headed by president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, called for communication between both sides. “It is necessary to stop this path of non-dialogue,” he said. For him, the solution is that Catalan are able to vote about their future as the Slovenes did. “Asking the citizens is necessary,” he added. Ana Gomes also emphasized that dialogue is the key to find a way out. “I hope they are released soon and that the question is sorted with negotiation and not with these kind of measures which disgrace Spain’s name,” she claimed.

'The imprisonment is not a solution, we have to find another one,' says ALDE MEP

Some MEPs of the Liberal group in the European Parliament also rejected the incarcerations. “The imprisonment is not a solution. We have to find another one, the political dialogue,” said the Croatian Ivan Jakovcic. “Madrid and Barcelona needed more dialogue, more exchange and less threats and imprisonments,” said Petras Austrevicius, from Lithuania.

The group Greens/EFA has also expressed opposition to the precautionary measures including jail imposed by the Spanish justice to the Catalan ministers. “It is certainly a bad idea, a bad precedent and I do not think that it can contribute at all to find a reasonable and political solution,” stated the Hungarian Tamás Meszerics. His colleague Indrek Tarand, from Estonia, had a similar viewpoint. “I do not think that putting them behind bars is something normal in the 21st century.” In fact, he said that this measure has no room in a “democratic society.”

The European United Left-Nordic Green Left (GUE-NGL) group is also skeptical about how Spain is facing the Catalan issue. The Portuguese MEP Marisa Matias branded the imprisonments as “unacceptable.” “We are talking about political prisoners, and not prisoners who are politicians, which is very different,” she added. “It is very serious for democracy in the EU,” claimed Matias. Indeed, she said that Brussels would have reacted with emergency resolutions if the same situation had happened in a country outside the Union.

Some members of European Conservatives and Reformists group have also criticized Madrid recently for the incarcerations. Mark Demesmaeker, from Belgium, said some days ago also to ACN that what is at stake is “the fundamental principles of the European Union, the democratic values and rights and civil freedoms.” In the BBC, the British Tory MEP David Hannan branded the current situation as “unthinkable.” He also asked citizens to imagine London arresting former Scottish prime minister Alex Salmond some years ago instead of sitting at the same table and agreeing on a referendum.

Google já fornece internet por balões para 100 mil pessoas em Porto Rico

Por Redação                        | 13 de Novembro de 2017 às 09h03

Porto Rico foi um dos locais mais devastados pela passagem do furacão Maria em setembro de 2017. A reconstrução da ilha, que é território norte-americano, vem sendo feita ao longo dos últimos meses, sempre com muito apoio de empresas privadas. A Tesla, por exemplo, está fornecendo eletricidade a partir de painéis solares e miniusinas de energia para hospitais públicos.  Outra empresa americana que está contribuindo na reconstrução da nação porto-riquenha é a Alphabet, dona da Google. Através de sua subsidiária X, a empresa está fornecendo internet móvel através de balões do Project Loon posicionados na atmosfera.  Depois de ter sido autorizada pela FCC, a Anatel dos Estados Unidos, a levar seu projeto para reconstruir as linhas de telecomunicações em Porto Rico, a X começou a colocar os balões nos céus da ilha há menos de um mês. Com eles, ela consegue fornecer internet móvel LTE para clientes das operadoras AT&T e T-Mobile.  Agora, no última quinta-feira (09), a Alphabet divulgou que aproximadamente 100 mil pessoas estão sendo servidas pelo sistema de telecomunicações via balões. É a primeira vez que o Project Loon alcança um número tão expressivo de pessoas, e uma quantidade tão grande de balões lançados a atmosfera, em um ritmo tão rápido.       — The Team at X (@Theteamatx) 9 de novembro de 2017    Porém, nem tudo são flores. As constantes variações de vento na ilha têm sido uma preocupação para a garantia de conectividade dos balões, que são controlados via computador e algoritmos capazes de antever as correntes de vento e manter a navegação no rumo necessário para não haver interrupção nos serviços. Cada balão cobre uma área de 5.000 quilômetros quadrados.

1670,1,,"Existe uma categoria dentro dos notebooks intermediários para quem quer tela touchscreen e um notebook que vira tablet – a famosa 2 em 1. O Lenovo Yoga 520 se encaixa nessa classificação.

Ele oferece tela de 14 polegadas, processador Intel Core i5 ou i7, de 4 GB a 8 GB de RAM e até um modelo com SSD. Os preços variam de R$ 2.899 a R$ 4.499. Mas e aí, vale a pena?

Para começar, a Lenovo mandou bem: o Yoga 520 tem um ótimo acabamento de alumínio. Ele não suja fácil nem escorrega das mãos, mas o modelo que eu testei veio com alguns riscos, então cuidado por onde você anda com o seu notebook.

É bem fácil carregá-lo por aí: com 1,74 kg e 19,9 mm de espessura, o notebook é relativamente fino, mas mais leve que a média, ideal por ser 2 em 1. Consegui aproveitá-lo bem nos três modos de uso: comum, modo tenda e tablet.

Das três portas USB, duas são USB 3.0 e uma é USB-C (boa, Lenovo!). O Yoga 520 também tem entrada HDMI, para cartão SD e para fones de ouvido de 3,5 mm.

No geral, o hardware externo desse notebook não deixa a desejar. O teclado tem retroiluminação e as teclas são ótimas, levemente curvadas para deixar a digitação mais confortável.

Só não gostei muito do touchpad, que tem o clique duro e o reconhecimento não é dos melhores. Ao lado, também fica o leitor de impressões digitais, que pode ser usado com o Windows Hello.

Por R$ 299, a Lenovo vende a Active Pen, uma caneta com reconhecimento de pressão e previsão de toque. É uma boa adição, mas a caneta é avulsa e não se acopla ao notebook. Tome cuidado para não perdê-la: eu esqueci a minha na casa de uma amiga, mas já recuperei (sorry, Lenovo!).

Os alto-falantes são feitos pela Harman, empresa que foi comprada pela Samsung e que também detém a JBL. Mas a marca diz pouco para esse modelo; a qualidade não é excelente, e sim apenas satisfatória, pois o som é abafado e raso.

O ponto negativo aqui fica para a tela de 14 polegadas com resolução de 1366×768 pixels; para um modelo intermediário, considero indispensável resolução 1080p. Além da baixa qualidade, o display do Yoga 520 tem cores lavadas, péssimo ângulo de visão e reflete bastante.

A situação se agrava quando só há uma versão do notebook com resolução de 1920×1080 pixels, exclusiva do site da Lenovo e custa R$ 3.699.

Como o Yoga 520 tem especificações parecidas com o Inspiron 15 5000, posso escrever a mesma coisa aqui:

Como todo notebook que combina um processador i7 com um HD de 5400 RPM, o desempenho foi inconsistente. No uso diário, o Chrome chegou a travar e os aplicativos normalmente demoram para abrir. O Windows demora para inicializar e a tela de login por vezes atrasava na hora de abrir o meu usuário.

No Yoga 520, tive até outros problemas; no começo, a unidade que recebi estava travando muito, com a tela apagando e qualquer coisa demorava mais que o normal para abrir. Precisei restaurar o dispositivo às configurações de fábrica (e apagar seu conteúdo) para conseguir usá-lo propriamente.

E, ainda assim, não fiquei satisfeito. Achei o Inspiron 15 5000 mais rápido, e os modelos que testei tinham a mesma configuração de processador, RAM e HD – isso porque o Yoga 520 tem uma resolução menor. Mesmo com um processador Intel Core i7, não consigo falar com segurança que o Yoga aguenta tarefas mais parrudas.

Por conta disso, o modelo que eu testei, de R$ 3.599, tem pouca vantagem em relação a opções inferiores que vêm com i5 — caso você não esteja apto a gastar R$ 4.499 no modelo com SSD.

A Lenovo confirmou ao Tecnoblog que o consumidor pode colocar um SSD por conta própria, desde que a troca não danifique o aparelho. No entanto, a empresa acrescentou que “recomenda a compra do Yoga 520 na configuração de fábrica”.

A bateria deste notebook é mediana: não aguenta as 10 horas prometidas pela Lenovo fora da tomada, mas também não obriga você a ficar conectado a um plug.

Nos meus testes, usei o Yoga 520 para assistir Terrace House (obrigado pela recomendação, Alecrim!), o que me ajudou a não morrer de tédio durante voos atrasados. A bateria durou cerca de 4h30, mas os episódios já estavam baixados e eu não usei qualquer outro aplicativo no período. É de se esperar uma autonomia inferior em um uso mais intenso.

Não me leve a mal: o Yoga 520 é um bom notebook, mas as versões oferecidas têm especificações que não combinam com o preço, salvo pelo modelo base, de R$ 2.899.

É uma pena ver que a versão com resolução de 1920×1080 pixels não tem SSD de fábrica, enquanto o modelo de R$ 4.499 com memória flash não tem resolução maior. É legal que a empresa ofereça um notebook com SSD, mas com resolução de 1366×768 não dá para aceitar.

No final das contas, outros modelos trazem um melhor conjunto, como o Inspiron 13 5000, que também é 2 em 1 e vem com processador i7, 8 GB de RAM e SSD de 256 GB por R$ 4.229. O Yoga 520 só vale a pena se você quer um 2 em 1 quase intermediário.

1671,1,,"Foi intensa a disputa entre Sony, Warner e Paramount pelos direitos à distribuição do próximo filme do diretor Quentin Tarantino. E a Sony acabou levando o contrato.

Segundo o site Deadline, Tarantino escolheu a Sony devido aos conhecimentos de história cinematográfica do presidente da empresa, Tom Rothman.

A disputa pela distribuição de “#9” (apelido dado ao nono filme do diretor, ainda sem nome) já é considerada uma das maiores negociações em Hollywood dos últimos tempos, e começou logo após Tarantino perder seu produtor e amigo, Harvey Weinstein, que foi demitido de sua própria empresa, a The Weinstein Company, após receber fortes acusações de assédio sexual e estupro.

Das grandes distribuidoras de Hollywood, apenas a Disney não entrou na briga.

O próximo filme de Tarantino se passará no final dos anos 1960 e abordará os contextos sociais, políticos e culturais da época do surgimento da Família Manson, embora o foco não seja exatamente a vida de Charles Manson.

“#9” já tem alguns nomes de peso confirmado no elenco, como Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Margot Robbie e (claro!) Samuel L. Jackson. O orçamento está estimado em aproximadamente US$ 100 milhões.

1676,4,,"A bancada do PT na Câmara ingressou nesta quinta-feira (9), na Procuradoria Regional da República em Brasília, com representação contra Michel Temer e o ministro do Planejamento, Dyogo Henrique de Oliveira.

A ação petista traz a narrativa de que é tanto um ato de improbidade administrativa como um crime de responsabilidade ter editado o decreto 9.188/2017, que desburocratiza a venda de estatais, aumentando a chance de vendê-las, tirando das mãos de partidos da extrema esquerda uma das mais importantes fontes de renda.

A representação, encabeçada pelos líderes do PT, deputado Carlos Zarattini (SP), da Minoria, deputado José Guimarães (PT-CE), e o da Minoria no Congresso, deputado Décio Lima (PT-SC), pede a instauração de inquérito civil público sob a narrativa de que existiria a prática de improbidade administrativa.

“É gravíssimo! É crime de lesa-pátria”, comentou o líder do PT.

Bem, crime é o que o PT fez com as estatais. Foi na Petrobrás que ocorreu o maior escândalo de corrupção do mundo. E foi no BNDES que ocorreu outro mega escândalo.

Está aí o motivo pelo qual eles não admitem a venda de estatais.

1681,2,,"Um experimento, para um teste de biologia, foi realizado por 5 meninas do norte da Jutlândia na 9ª série. As meninas surgiram com a idéia porque achavam difícil se concentrar durante o dia da escola: ""Todos pensamos ter experimentado dificuldade em se concentrar na escola, se tivéssemos dormido com o telefone ao lado da nossa cabeça e às vezes também tivemos dificuldade para dormir"", explica Lea Nielsen. O interesse em sua experiência atraiu a atenção internacional entre biólogos reconhecidos e especialistas em radiação, pesquisadores da Inglaterra, Holanda e Suécia.

Após 12 dias, os resultados foram claros: as sementes de agrião próximas ao roteador não cresceram, e algumas delas foram mesmo mutadas ou mortas. ""É realmente assustador que tenha tantos efeitos, então ficamos muito chocados com o resultado"", diz Lea. Olle Johansson, renomado professor do Instituto Karolinska em Estocolmo, é um dos pesquisadores impressionados. Ele vai agora repetir o experimento com uma colega de pesquisa belga, a professora Marie-Claire Cammaert na Université libre de Bruxelles. De acordo com Olle, esta experiência é absolutamente brilhante: ""As meninas ficaram dentro do alcance de seus conhecimentos, implementaram habilmente e desenvolveram uma experiência muito elegante. A riqueza de detalhes e precisão é exemplar, escolher agrião era muito inteligente, e eu poderia continuar "", diz ele. O experimento provou que a emissão de radiação eletrônica não é inofensiva, como muitos parecem acreditar, isso é algo que a maioria do mundo faz sem conhecer as conseqüências. ""Nenhum de nós dorme com o celular ao lado da cama. Ou o telefone é colocado longe, ou é colocado em outro quarto. E o computador está sempre desligado "", diz Lea. É extremamente importante manter roteadores WiFi e telefones celulares fora e longe de você enquanto você dorme, já que esta descoberta ainda está em estágios iniciais e há mais experiências ainda por vir, estou razoavelmente certo que os resultados futuros serão semelhantes a isso. Eu, pessoalmente, mantenho esses dispositivos em outro quarto ou desligado quando estou dormindo para tentar diminuir a quantidade de radiação WiFi, você pode querer considerar fazer o mesmo!

1685,1,,"Take a look at your desktop computer. What operating system is it currently running?

Now take a look in your data center — at all of your servers. What operating system are they running?

Linux? Microsoft Windows? Mac OS X? You could be running any of those three — or one of countless others.

But here’s the crazy part: That’s not the only operating system you’re running.

If you have a modern Intel CPU (released in the last few years) with Intel’s Management Engine built in, you’ve got another complete operating system running that you might not have had any clue was in there: MINIX.

That’s right. MINIX. The Unix-like OS originally developed by Andrew Tanenbaum as an educational tool — to demonstrate operating system programming — is built into every new Intel CPU.

MINIX is running on “Ring -3” (that’s “negative 3”) on its own CPU. A CPU that you, the user/owner of the machine, have no access to. The lowest “Ring” you have any real access to is “Ring 0,” which is where the kernel of your OS (the one that you actually chose to use, such as Linux) resides. Most user applications take place in “Ring 3” (without the negative).

The first thing that jumps out at me here: This means MINIX (specifically a version of MINIX 3) is in all likelihood the most popular OS shipping today on modern Intel-based computers (desktops, laptops and servers). That, right there, is absolutely crazy.

The second thing to make my head explode: You have zero access to “Ring -3” / MINIX. But MINIX has total and complete access to the entirety of your computer. All of it. It knows all and sees all, which presents a huge security risk — especially if MINIX, on that super-secret Ring -3 CPU, is running many services and isn’t updated regularly with security patches.

According to Google, which is actively working to remove Intel’s Management Engine (MINIX) from their internal servers (for obvious security reasons), the following features exist within Ring -3:

That’s right. A web server. Your CPU has a secret web server that you are not allowed to access, and, apparently, Intel does not want you to know about.

Why on this green Earth is there a web server in a hidden part of my CPU? WHY?

The only reason I can think of is if the makers of the CPU wanted a way to serve up content via the internet without you knowing about it. Combine that with the fact that Ring -3 has 100 percent access to everything on the computer, and that should make you just a teensy bit nervous.

The security risks here are off the charts — for home users and enterprises. The privacy implications are tremendous and overwhelming.

Note to Intel: If Google doesn’t trust your CPUs on their own servers, maybe you should consider removing this “feature.” Otherwise, at some point they’ll (likely) move away from your CPUs entirely.

Note to AMD: Now might be a good time to remove similar functionality from your CPU lines to try to win market share from Intel. Better to do so now before Intel removes the “Management Engine.” Strike while the iron’s hot and all that.

Note to Andrew Tanenbaum: Your operating system, MINIX, is now one of the most used on modern computers! That’s kinda cool, right?

Note to everyone else: We’re all MINIX users now.

Menina com lâmina de barbear anuncia suicídio em vídeo ao vivo. Recém-nascido é espancado por parente no berço. Vaca é despedaçada viva em moedor gigante de madeira.

Tudo o que há de pior no Facebook durante oito horas diárias, de segunda a sexta-feira, em troca de um salário mínimo. O brasileiro Sergio, que pede para não ser identificado, viveu esta rotina por quase um ano, até abandonar o emprego de revisor de denúncias sobre violência e ódio em português na rede social - e se tornar uma pessoa mais ""fria e insensível"" na vida offline.

""Eu via vídeos ao vivo para checar se alguém se mataria"", diz ele, cuja função era decidir o mais rápido possível se publicações agressivas eram toleráveis ou passavam dos limites estabelecidos pelo Facebook.

Em seu escritório, a meta para cada revisor era avaliar, por dia, 3.500 fotos, vídeos e textos denunciados. Mais de 7 por minuto, ou um a cada 8,5 segundos.

""Impossível não ter erro humano nesse ritmo"", diz Sergio, que hoje trabalha como freelancer e decidiu apagar seus rastros na rede social depois de a conhecer ""por dentro"".

Na semana em que Mark Zuckerberg anunciou a contratação de 10 mil novos funcionários diretos e indiretos para funções como a desempenhada por Sergio, a rotina do brasileiro em uma espécie de call center digital ilustra o desafio enfrentado pelo Facebook para conter milhões de demonstrações explícitas de violência com consequências cada vez mais dramáticas - do incentivo a suicídios infantis a ameaças à segurança nacional do país mais rico do mundo.

No Estados Unidos, na semana passada, o Facebook admitiu que grupos russos criaram perfis falsos ligados a movimentos sociais como o Black Lives Matter para divulgar memes que incitavam o ódio de grupos racistas durante as eleições de 2016.

Segundo as revelações do Senado americano, notícias falsas sobre muçulmanos também teriam sido impulsionadas por russos na rede para irritar o eleitorado xenófobo.

Procurada na manhã desta terça-feira, 7, a matriz americana do Facebook encaminhou as perguntas da BBC Brasil ao escritório paulista da rede, que no início da noite informou que ""não irá comentar"" os relatos do ex-funcionário.

Nas questões enviadas, a reportagem pedia confirmação das informações sobre carga horária e metas, respostas sobre contratos de trabalho terceirizados e dados sobre eventual apoio psicológico a trabalhadores expostos a publicações violentas.

Para além da frieza dos robôs e relatórios, a experiência do brasileiro traz luz ao trabalho daqueles que ocupam funções de base em empresas terceirizadas pelo império de Mark Zuckerberg - com relações de trabalho bem diferentes do clichê de escritórios descolados, do Vale do Silício, com montanhas de M&Ms e cachorros-quentes à disposição das equipes.

Em um prédio com longas bancadas de computadores distribuídas em vários andares, Sergio e aproximadamente 500 colegas do mundo inteiro passavam dias avaliando denúncias sobre pedofilia, nudez, necrofilia, suicídios, assassinatos, assédios, ameaças, armas, drogas e violência animal publicadas em mais de 10 idiomas.

Segundo o ex-funcionário, nestes centros de revisão da rede social mais usada do planeta, celulares são proibidos, pausas para comida ou banheiro são monitoradas e contratos de trabalho preveem multas e processos judiciais contra vazamento de informações.

""Era como um grande call center, sem os telefones. A gente estava ali para atender ao cliente: no caso, o Facebook e todos os seus usuários"", diz.

Em seu computador, Sergio tinha acesso a uma linha do tempo ""alternativa"" que exibia apenas as postagens alvo de denúncias de usuários, de forma aleatória, junto a um menu sobre possíveis violações.

Os moderadores só visualizam o nome do autor das publicações e não têm acesso a seus perfis completos. Sua missão é apagar, ignorar ou encaminhar a publicação para a avaliação superior - o que ocorre especialmente em casos de suicídio ou pedofilia, que por sua vez são encaminhados a autoridades.

As decisões, pautadas por políticas internas da rede social, servem para ""educar"" os algoritmos, que com o tempo repetem as respostas automaticamente, por meio de recursos avançados de identificação de rostos ou frases ofensivas.

""Quanto mais ensinávamos o algoritmo, menos nos tornávamos necessários. Nosso trabalho era tornar o nosso trabalho obsoleto"", diz Sergio.

O brasileiro também pede sigilo sobre a cidade onde trabalhava, mas conta que o Facebook escolhe locais com alto fluxo de estrangeiros, onde é fácil encontrar pessoas fluentes em diferentes idiomas.

Os revisores de conteúdo são normalmente jovens profissionais que vivem no exterior ou que não encontram trabalho em suas áreas. A rotatividade é alta e a maioria não completa um ano no posto.

Para conseguirem decidir em menos de 10 segundos se uma publicação merece ou não ser apagada, os funcionários decoram regras e recebem memorandos digitais sobre mudanças em listas de grupos extremistas ou atualizações em políticas, como a que permitiu fotos e vídeos de mães amamentando e imagens de mulheres que passaram por mastectomia.

A pressão para cumprir as metas aparecia, segundo Sergio, em reuniões recorrentes com supervisores.

""Tinha relatórios periódicos sobre metas de moderação. Os chefes às vezes pareciam cheerleaders (líderes de torcida, em inglês) e tentavam nos motivar dizendo que havíamos 'salvado X pessoas de suicídios ou agressões no mês'"", conta.

""Mas também diziam sempre que a continuidade dos nossos empregos dependia do batimento das metas diárias e citavam outros lugares com resultados melhores que o nosso. A gente nunca sabia quanto tempo o escritório iria durar"", completa o ex-funcionário.

Há uma semana, ao anunciar um aumento de 47% no faturamento anual do Facebook, que ultrapassou pela primeira vez na história a marca de US$ 10 bilhões em um trimestre, Mark Zuckerberg prometeu investir em ""pessoas e tecnologia para identificar mau comportamento e remover notícias falsas, discurso de ódio, bullying e outros conteúdos problemáticos"" da rede.

Em maio, a chefe de Política Global do Facebook, Monika Bickert, comentou o trabalho de revisores como Sergio em um texto sobre os desafios da moderação de conteúdos.

""Eles têm um obstáculo: entender o contexto. É difícil julgar a intenção por trás de uma postagem, ou o risco implícito em outra. Alguém publica um vídeo violento de um ataque terrorista. Isso inspirará as pessoas a imitar a violência, ou a falar contra isso? Alguém escreve uma piada sobre suicídio. É um mero comentário ou um grito de ajuda?""

O brasileiro confirma as dificuldades, mas diz que não conseguia discutir decisões com superiores. ""Não tinha espaço para pensamento crítico, o trabalho tinha que ser automático e acelerado. Era seguir o manual, apertar botão e não fazer muitas perguntas"", diz.

Os dados mais recentes do Facebook apontam que a rede exclui quase 300 mil publicações por mês. Entre os brasileiros, segundo o ex-revisor, boa parte dos conteúdos denunciados são casos de nudez.

""Ver conteúdos fortes todos os dias te faz perder a sensibilidade para certas coisas. Especialmente em relação à nudez - eram tantas selfies de gente nua, closes em pênis, vaginas e mamilos, que a pornografia perdeu a graça"", afirma.

Como não há consenso nas leis de diferentes países sobre conteúdos ofensivos ou discurso de ódio online (frases que podem levar à prisão em locais como a Alemanha podem ser protegidas como liberdade de expressão pela Constituição dos EUA), o Facebook criou suas próprias regras, considerando raça e etnia, religião, gênero e orientação sexual como ""categorias protegidas"".

Os revisores são orientados, seguindo as normas da rede, a apagar ""qualquer ataque direto a pessoas"" com base nestas categorias.

Sobre violência, a rede determina que imagens de interesse público, ""como abusos de direitos humanos ou atos de terrorismo"", sejam mantidas quando as postagens expressarem reprovação ou conscientização.

Em casos de compartilhamento ""pelo prazer sádico de celebrar ou enaltecer a violência"", elas devem ser apagadas. Muitos casos geravam discórdia entre os funcionários.

""Ferimento grave, por exemplo, podia. Se depois de ser atropelada em um vídeo a pessoa ainda estivesse se mexendo, o conteúdo era marcado como ""sensível"", mas continuava no ar"", lembra. ""Só se houvesse morte a gente apagava"".

Além da pressa, códigos sociais usados por diferentes grupos podiam dificultar o trabalho dos moderadores.

""Muitos gays chamam uns aos outros de 'veado', por exemplo. Veado (ou faggot, em inglês) era uma palavra proibida, a não ser que fosse uma autorrefêrencia. E acontecia sempre de um gay usar a palavra veado e ter a conta bloqueada ou desativada por ofensa"", diz Sergio. ""Muitas vezes, na moderação, era a gente quem decidia se a pessoa era gay ou não na hora de analisar a denúncia.""

A rede social costuma reconhecer falhas no sistema. ""Nossos erros causaram muita preocupação em várias comunidades, inclusive entre grupos que sentem que nós agimos - ou deixamos de agir - por parcialidade"", dizia um post do Facebook em julho.

""Estamos profundamente empenhados em discutir e enfrentar a parcialidade em qualquer lugar do mundo. Ao mesmo tempo, trabalhamos para corrigir nossos erros rapidamente, assim que eles acontecem.""

Sergio diz que nunca encontrou uma denúncia de postagem envolvendo algum amigo ou conhecido - as publicacões para revisão apareciam em seu computador de forma aleatória.

Ameaças contra políticos e pessoas públicas, no entanto, eram frequentes, diz ele - e as regras da rede para este público são distintas.

""Nós apagamos ameaças reais contra a integridade física das pessoas e removemos ameças específicas de roubo, vandalismo ou prejuízo financeiro"", dizem as regras oficiais do Facebook.

O texto oficial diz, porém, que em casos de ""pessoas com visibilidade pública"", as chances reais ""das ameaças se concretizarem"" são levadas em consideração na hora de apagar ou não a postagem.

Segundo Sergio, publicações como o vídeo em que o deputado Jair Bolsonaro afirma que a colega Maria do Rosario ""não merece ser estuprada"" e comentários violentos continuaram no ar porque a deputada se encaixaria nesta categoria. ""Qualquer pessoa com mais de 100 mil seguidores é considerada pública"", afirma o brasileiro.

Ele conta que o que mais chocava os colegas era a crueldade de publicações com agressões a animais. ""Num deles aparecia uma máquina de matadouro, com uma corda que girava presa a um motor e tinha uma vaca amarrada em uma das pontas. A corda a puxava e ela era despedaçada viva"", diz.

A exposição excessiva a imagens violentas já levou moderadores do Facebook a desenvolverem distúrbios de ansiedade, problemas sexuais e pânico, segundo jornais estrangeiros.

O brasileiro, no entanto, diz que era afetado em menor grau pelas imagens.

""Primeiro, porque nasci no Brasil, e nossas referências sobre violência tendem a ser mais agressivas que as de colegas europeus, por exemplo"", afirma.

Ele continua: ""Depois, porque eu via todos os dias vídeos de brutalidades contra crianças, minorias e bichos, e a gente acaba se acostumando com imagens gráficas. Para mim, a crueldade humana em termos de palavras, apoiando agressões, pregando ódio, rindo de vítimas em comentários e compartilhamentos, era sempre muito pior"".

Os traumas levaram Sergio a apagar definitivamente deu perfil no Facebook.

""Para não ficar preso nas bolhas, nas câmaras de eco onde as pessoas só ouvem as próprias vozes e as de quem concorda com elas, eu decidi me isolar"", conta o brasileiro.""Eu não queria me tornar uma daquelas pessoas que apareciam nas denúncias.""

As previsões vêm de nada menos do que a companhia Goldman Sachs, que, em uma nota enviada a seus clientes, aponta um crescimento no valor da moeda para mais de US$ 8.000 até o fim de novembro.

O motivo para o crescimento tão acelerado no valor da moeda seria resultado de um anúncio feito pelo CME Group, um dos maiores do mercado financeiro, que afirmou estar prestes a trabalhar também com o Bitcoin.

Visto que essas são apenas especulações, não há como afirmar com total certeza de que isso de fato vá acontecer. Mas, vendo que o Bitcoin está crescendo com velocidade impressionante, não seria surpresa nenhuma ver o valor da moeda disparar para ainda mais do que já vemos. Resta esperar.

1705,6,,"In the beginning of this year the programming language Swift peaked at a rating of 2.3% in the TIOBE index and even reached a top 10 position. But now it is back at position 16 and constantly declining month after month. Until recently it was quite common to program Android apps in Java and iOS apps in Swift/Objective-C. This is quite cumbersome because you have to maintain two code bases that are doing almost the same. So frameworks for mobile hybrid apps were developed and now that they have grown mature these are becoming very popular. Market leaders in this area are Microsoft's Xamarin (C#), Apache's Cordova (JavaScript) and Ionic (JavaScript). The consequences of all of this are that languages such as C# and JavaScript are gaining popularity at the cost of languages such as Java and Swift.

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming  languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of  skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.

The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a  strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new  software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.

The complete top 50 of programming languages is listed below. This overview is  published unofficially, because it could be the case that we missed a language. If you have the impression there is a programming language lacking, please notify us  at tpci@tiobe.com. Please also check the overview of all programming languages that we monitor.

The following list of languages denotes #51 to #100. Since the differences are  relatively small, the programming languages are only listed (in alphabetical order).

This month the following changes have been made to the definition of the index:

Nenad Rakocevic suggested to add the Red programming language to the TIOBE index. It meets all requirements and debuts at position 117.

There are lots of mails that still need to be processed. As soon as there is more time available your mail will be answered. Please be patient.

To see the bigger picture, please find below the positions of the top 10 programming languages of many years back. Please note that these are average positions for a period of 12 months.

The hall of fame listing all ""Programming Language of the Year"" award winners is shown below. The award is given to the programming language that has the highest rise in ratings in a year.

This is the top 5 of most requested changes and bugs. If you have any suggestions how to improve the index don't hesitate to send an e-mail to tpci@tiobe.com.

Apart from ""<language> programming"", also other queries such as ""programming with <language>"", ""<language> development"" and ""<language> coding"" should be tried out.

Add queries for other natural languages (apart from English). The idea is to start with the Chinese search engine Baidu. This has been implemented partially and will be completed the next few months.

Add a list of all search term requests that have been rejected. This is to minimize the number of recurring mails about Rails, JQuery, JSP, etc.

Some search engines allow to query pages that have been added last year. The TIOBE index should only track those recently added pages.

Q: Am I allowed to show the TIOBE index in my weblog/presentation/publication?

A: Yes, the only condition is to refer to its original source ""www.tiobe.com"".

Q: How may I nominate a new language to be added to the TIOBE index?

A: If a language meets the criteria of being listed (i.e. it is Turing complete and has an own Wikipedia entry that indicates that it concerns a programming language) and it is sufficiently popular (more than 5,000 hits for +"" programming"" for Google), then please write an e-mail to tpci@tiobe.com.

Q: I would like to have the complete data set of the TIOBE index. Is this possible?

A: We spent a lot of effort to obtain all the data and keep the TIOBE index up to date.  In order to compensate a bit for this, we ask a fee of 5,000 US$ for the complete data set.  The data set runs from June 2001 till today. It started with 25 languages back in 2001, and  now measures more than 150 languages once a month. The data are availabe in comma separated  format. Please contact  sales@tiobe.com for more information.

Q: Why is the maximum taken to calculate the ranking for a grouping, why not the sum?

A: Well, you can do it either way and both are wrong. If you take the sum, then you get the intersection  twice. If you take the max, then you miss the difference. Which one to choose? Suppose somebody comes up with a new search term that is 10% of  the original. If you take the max, nothing changes. If you take the sum then the ratings will rise 10%. So  taking the sum will be an incentive for some to come up with all kinds of obscure terms for a language. That's  why we decided to take the max.

The proper way to solve this is is of course to take the sum and subtract the intersection. This will give  rise to an explosion of extra queries that must be performed. Suppose a language has a grouping of 15 terms,  then you have to perform 32,768 queries (all combinations of intersections).  So this seems not possible either... If somebody has a solution for this, please let us know.

Q: What happened to Java in April 2004? Did you change your methodology?

A: No, we did not change our methodology at that time. Google changed its methodology.  They performed a general sweep action to get rid of all kinds of web sites that had been  pushed up. As a consequence, there was a huge drop for languages such as Java and C++. In  order to minimize such fluctuations in the future, we added two more search engines (MSN  and Yahoo) a few months after this incident.

Q: Why is YouTube used as a search engine for the TIOBE index?

A: First of all, YouTube counts for less than 10% of all ratings, so it has hardly any  influence on the index. YouTube has been added as an experiment. It qualified for the TIOBE  index because of its high ranking on Alexa. YouTube is a young platform (so an indicator  for popularity) and there are quite some lectures, presentations, programming tips and  language introductions available on YouTube.

1715,1,,"Conrad Wolfram (Oxford, 1970) avalia que nós temos um problema com a matemática. Ninguém está satisfeito: os estudantes acham que é uma matéria difícil e desinteressante, os professores se sentem frustrados com os resultados de seus alunos e os governos sabem que ela é importante para a economia, mas não sabem como atualizar os currículos escolares. “Vivemos em um mundo cada vez mais matemático, mas o seu ensino está estancado”, avalia Wolfram, físico e matemático formado pela Universidade de Cambridge e fundador da Computer Based Math, uma empresa focada na revisão do ensino da matemática que lançou há dois anos o seu programa piloto numa parceria com o Governo da Estônia.

Em 2010, Wolfram chamou a atenção de educadores e especialistas em educação de várias partes do mundo com sua palestra na TED intitulada Como ensinar a matemática do mundo real às crianças, que teve mais de 1,5 milhão de reproduções e na qual analisa os motivos pelos quais os estudantes perderam o interesse pela disciplina que está por trás das “mais emocionantes criações da humanidade”, desde os foguetes até as bolsas de valores.

Um excesso de horas dedicadas a aprender a calcular grandes equações e fazer contas em geral. Essa é a grande falha, segundo Wolfram, que aposta na introdução da computação nas salas de aula, deixando que as máquinas façam os cálculos.

Pergunta. Se as crianças não aprenderem a calcular, fazendo as operações com o computador, como irão entender o que estão fazendo?

Resposta. Os matemáticos vão me odiar por dizer isto, mas antes da existência dos computadores a matemática não era muito útil no dia a dia, para a vida em geral. Como em qualquer campo em que se utilizam muitos dados, como a física, a biologia ou a saúde, a computação elevou a matemática um novo patamar. Os problemas reais do século XXI só podem ser solucionados com o uso do computador, por isso ele deve entrar no sistema educacional como uma parte fundamental da disciplina de matemática. Não tem mais sentido que as crianças façam cálculos de equações de segundo grau em sala de aula; é preciso ensiná-las a interpretar os dados e a explorar a matemática em toda a sua utilidade. Tudo bem ensinar o seu funcionamento básico, mas complicar isso tudo até o esgotamento é uma estratégia equivocada que distancia o aluno da disciplina para o resto da vida. Basta dar o exemplo da condução: não é preciso entender o funcionamento do motor para dirigir um carro.

P. Alguns especialistas dizem que o cálculo ajuda a apreender o sentido dos números e constitui uma boa ferramenta para treinar a tomada de decisões.

R. Quando foi a última vez que você multiplicou 3/17 por 2/15? Provavelmente aprendeu a fazer isso na escola, mas nunca mais voltou a fazer essa conta. Muitos especialistas dirão que ao multiplicar frações você aprende, mas, na verdade, está apenas relembrando um determinado procedimento. Na verdade, não entende para o que faz isso, nem para que isso serve. Um exemplo bastante simples: na equação x+2=4, lhe ensinaram que se você passar o 2 para a direita, o sinal muda e se transforma em menos 2. Nesse caso você também não entende o que está fazendo. A matemática tradicional já não faz sentido e provavelmente 80% do conteúdo das aulas não é útil e você jamais utilizará fora da escola.

P. Alguém poderia objetar que deixar que o computador faça os cálculos na idade de aprendizado é coisa de preguiçoso.

R. Tentar saber como é que o computador funciona não requer menos trabalho para o cérebro. Muito pelo contrário. Os problemas a serem resolvidos são muito mais complexos, e é aí que as crianças deveriam ser treinadas. A programação é algo que hoje equivaleria ao cálculo à mão. Saber dizer ao computador de forma muito precisa, com códigos e números, o que ele tem de fazer. Matemática, programação e raciocínio computacional devem fazer parte de uma mesma disciplina.

P. Poderia dar um exemplo de uma situação da vida real do que o senhor está falando?

R. Se eu lhe mostro os dados de dois sites e pergunto qual dos dois funciona melhor, a primeira pergunta que você deve fazer é o que significa melhor. Pode ser o tempo que os usuários passam em cada um deles ou as vezes que têm de clicar em algumas das abas... No mundo real, você pode usar a machine learning ou a análise estatística para medir e analisar resultados. Escolher qual opção funciona melhor em cada caso é complicado, e esse tipo de conhecimento não é ensinado na escola. A matemática é muito mais do que cálculos, embora seja compreensível que durante centenas de anos tenhamos dado tanta importância a isso, pois só havia uma forma de fazê-lo: à mão. Acontece que a matemática se libertou do cálculo, mas essa libertação ainda não chegou ao ensino.

P. Sua empresa reinventou a disciplina da matemática, introduzindo a computação e novas habilidades a serem avaliadas, como a comunicação matemática. Como foi que conseguiu convencer o Governo da Estônia a implantar essa concepção nas escolas públicas?

R. Com 1,3 milhão de habitantes, a Estônia é considerado o país mais digitalizado da Europa. Seus habitantes podem votar, pagar impostos, acessar arquivos médicos ou registrar uma empresa a partir de seus computadores caseiros em poucos minutos. No último relatório PISA, o país ultrapassou os finlandeses em ciências e matemática e se tornou a nova referência em termos de inovação educacional na Europa. Há três anos, eu conheci em um colóquio o seu Ministro da Educação, que é físico. Dois anos depois, lançamos o primeiro projeto piloto, que está sendo adotado em 10% das escolas públicas do país. Focamos a disciplina, no caso dos estudantes do ensino médio, em probabilidade e estatística e mudamos o sistema de avaliação. Os alunos aprendem a resolver questões reais, como, por exemplo: as meninas são melhores em matemática? Minha estatura está na média? Estamos conversando também com a Irlanda e com a Austrália.

P. Já tentou oferecer o seu programa a escolas inovadoras do Reino Unido?

R. O colégio frequentado pela minha filha, que tem 13 anos, modernizou a disciplina de história. Na nossa época, costumávamos decorar datas e fatos históricos. Agora, o foco está em como pesquisar. O seu primeiro trabalho foi analisar a história da própria escola. O currículo de matemática, porém, continua intocado e estancado. A barreira fundamental, para as escolas, é o diploma; atingir os padrões de conhecimento predeterminados para poder entrar na faculdade. Um fato chama atenção: temos detectado que os países que ocupam as melhores posições no PISA são aqueles que estão mais abertos às mudanças, enquanto os outros, como no caso da Espanha, que está estagnada há 15 anos na mesma posição, são mais resistentes a elas.

P. A palestra na TED de 2010 marcou uma virada em sua carreira?

R. Trabalhei durante mais de 30 anos com meu irmão em nossa empresa de software Wolfram Research, que tem sede em Illinois, nos Estados Unidos, e conta com cerca de 500 funcionários. No mesmo ano da palestra na TED, eu montei um pequeno departamento em Oxford, com umas 30 pessoas, dedicado exclusivamente a repensar a disciplina da matemática. Nosso lema é redesenhar a matemática reconhecendo a existência dos computadores. A ideia surgiu a partir de um serviço que oferecíamos para a Apple, especificamente para a Siri, o seu sistema de busca por meio de reconhecimento da voz. Se você questiona esse sistema a respeito de qualquer operação matemática complexa, em segundos ele o remete para nós. Foi então que me perguntei por que obrigamos os estudantes a dedicarem tantos anos de suas vidas a aprender o que um telefone resolve em poucos segundos.

P. Acredita que os governos dariam mais atenção às reformas que o senhor propõe se ela partisse de uma grande universidade, com Cambridge, por exemplo?

R. Hoje em dia Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard ou o MIT são organizações comerciais, que buscam o lucro tanto quanto qualquer empresa. Os governos precisam refletir sobre isso e não retirar credibilidade de uma iniciativa determinada só porque ela não vem de uma universidade. O que os paralisa é a falta de evidências, e eles acham que não fazer nada é menos arriscado do que experimentar novos métodos. O sistema educacional está em falta cada vez mais com os estudantes, e isso se explica pela falta de perfis STEM (sigla em inglês para ciência, tecnologia, engenharia e matemática). Os jovens precisam ver alguma utilidade neles: ter habilidade para diferenciar uma boa hipoteca ou o ceticismo suficiente para questionar as estatísticas divulgadas pelo Governo. A falta de motivação é uma das grandes tragédias da matemática.

When Kim Dotcom was raided in 2012, US$42.5m of assets were seized in Hong Kong. A report detailing a new court hearing has revealed that the Megaupload founder is requesting access to NZ$1.2m (US$829,400) of that pool, to fund everything from rent to car maintenance and family holidays.

When Megaupload was shut down in January 2012, US authorities did everything within their power to financially ruin Kim Dotcom and his associates.

Aside from taking much of his personal property, tens of millions of dollars of assets were seized around the world.

Under instruction from the U. S. government, US$42.57m in assets were seized in Hong Kong and since then Dotcom has been trying to claw it back, bit by bit.

Back in July, Dotcom revealed that the Hong Kong High Court had released more of his funds, plus four containers of seized property. Noting that he missed the country, he gave thanks for the lifeline.

“Thanks to a Hong Kong Judge my family can move to Queenstown and my kids will be surrounded by beautiful mountains & lakes instead of spies,” Dotcom said.

That move eventually went ahead, with Dotcom regularly tweeting beautiful waterside views from his new home over the past few months. But of course, nice things tend to cost quite a bit of money, so Dotcom’s legal team have been working hard in Hong Kong to have more funds released.

According to a report from NZHerald, his latest request is fairly sizeable, reaching NZ$1.2m (US$829,400), everything considered.

First up, Dotcom is seeking around NZ$1m (US$691,200) for costs relating to his relocation from Auckland to Queenstown. That’s comprised of two years worth of rent at NZ$40,000 (US$27,648) per month (no typo), plus NZ$150,000 (US$103,680) to cover the actual cost of the move.

On top, Dotcom is looking for NZ$73,000 (US$50,457) per month for living expenses, an amount that’s roughly US$2,000 per month up on the amount he currently receives.

According to the report, Dotcom’s team are also proposing a further amount of NZ$200,000 (US$138,240) to cover emergency items including “medical expenses of the family, car maintenance, household repairs and two holidays of the family”.

It seems unlikely that this will be the final request from Dotcom. According to Gerard McCoy, Dotcom’s lawyer in Hong Kong, the extradition process in New Zealand is nowhere near complete. In fact, McCoy told the court that proceedings won’t be completed during the next two years.

That takes us to 2020, at least, meaning that Dotcom will still be in New Zealand a full eight years after the raid. Given the massive number of court battles and subsequent appeals into every detail of several resulting cases, that’s probably not a surprise, however.

The progress in the extradition process itself is also somewhat glacial, with the next hearing set for the first quarter of 2018 in the Court of Appeal. If past experience is anything to go by, neither side will be happy with the outcome. This means that an appeal to the Supreme Court is almost inevitable.

Over in the United States, progress has also been slow. Recently, a petition from Dotcom and his former Megaupload colleagues over millions of dollars in seized assets was denied by the US Supreme Court.

While this decision means that the battle over a further US$67 million in assets has been exhausted, the question of whether Dotcom and former colleagues Mathias Ortmann, Bram van der Kolk and Finn Batato will ever stand trial in the US remains unanswered.

1722,1,,"WASHINGTON — Os jogadores Neymar e Lionel Messi foram retratados em uma ameaça do Estado Islâmico (EI) à Copa do Mundo de 2018, na Rússia. O pôster mostra um terrorista que segura Neymar, de joelhos e com as mãos atadas, segurando uma bandeira do grupo extremista, enquanto Messi aparece executado. O novo cartaz foi divulgado dias após os jihadistas da Wafa Media Foundation, que apoia o EI, divulgarem uma imagem mostrando Messi, com um dos olhos sangrando, vestindo uma roupa de presidiário com seu nome escrito.

Antes do cartaz com Neymar e Messi e do outro em que o argentino figura sozinho, o organização divulgou outras imagens na campanha contra a Copa. Há duas semanas, um outro pôster mostrava o símbolo da Copa do Mundo ao lado de um homem com uma máscara, onde estava escrito: ""Espere por nós."" Em uma outra ameaça, a Wafa divulgou um pôster que mostrava um jihadista observando o estádio Luzhniki, em Moscou, que receberá partidas da Copa, com a frase: “Inimigos de Alá na Rússia, juro que o fogo dos mujahedins queimará vocês. Aguardem.”

O Iraque anunciou na quinta-feira o início do ataque ao último reduto do Estado Islâmico (EI) em seu território, perto da fronteira com a Síria. A batalha pretende asfixiar os jihadistas no vale do Eufrates, que vai da província de Deir Ezzor, no Leste da Síria, até Al-Qaim, no Oeste do Iraque. A ofensiva coincide com as movimentações do outro lado da fronteira, do Exército sírio e de seus aliados, para cercar os combatentes do grupo extremista.

As tropas governamentais e forças paramilitares expulsaram o Estado Islâmico de mais de 90% das áreas que dominavam. O general iraquiano Qasem Al-Mohamedi, que comanda as operações, disse que as tropas posicionadas ao redor da cidade de al-Qaim avançavam em ""quatro frentes: leste, sul, sudeste da cidade e a partir da província de Nínive, mais ao norte"". De acordo com a ONG Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), mais de 10 mil civis fugiram da região de al-Qaim e chegaram aos campos de deslocados da região de Ramadi desde o início do mês.

O Estado Islâmico (EI) vem sofrendo grandes derrotas, como a perda das duas capitais de seu autoentitulado califado, e, com isso, ao menos 5.600 combatentes do grupo de 33 nacionalidades, e suas mulheres e filhos, voltaram aos seus países de origem, segundo um relatório do centro de estudos antiterroristas The Soufan Center. Até 40 mil estrangeiros foram para a Síria e o Iraque para se juntar ao EI. Dados de centros administrativos em Raqqa conseguiram identificar 19 mil.

A partir de informações de diferentes fontes nacionais e internacionais, a lista de estrangeiros que foram lutar na Síria e no Iraque é encabeçada pela Rússia, que recebeu de volta 400 jihadistas dos 3.417 deixaram o país, seguida da Arábia Saudita, com 760 retornos dentre 3.244 saídas. A Jordânia vem em terceiro lugar, com 250 repatriados de 3 mil que saíram, a Tunísia, com 800 voltas de 2.926 e França de 271 de 1910. O Soufan Center reconhece que o fluxo de combatentes rumo ao Iraque e à Síria diminuiu no final de 2015, quando o EI começou a perder e os países começaram a implementar medidas para bloquear as viagens.

No dia 17 de outubro, a aliança de combatentes curdos e árabes apoiada pelos Estados Unidos retomou Raqqa, a capital do Estado Islâmico na Síria, onde dezenas de jihadistas estrangeiros estavam entrincheirados. A vitória teve um custo altíssimo: grande parte da cidade foi devastada pelos ataques aéreos liderados pelos americanos que mataram 3.250 pessoas — sendo 1.130 civis — nos últimos cinco meses, segundo o Observatório Sírio dos Direitos Humanos (OSDH). Ao todo, cerca de 270 mil moradores foram deslocados pelos combates e milhares de casas foram destruídas.

Nos últimos dias de combate, em virtude de um acordo negociado por responsáveis locais, civis presos na cidade puderam deixá-la e cerca de 275 combatentes extremistas e suas famílias foram autorizados a sair do local, segundo as FDS. A coalizão liderada por Washington afirmou que os jihadistas estrangeiros não seriam autorizados a ir embora de Raqqa.

— A última coisa que queremos é que os combatentes extrangeiros sejam liberados para poder regressar a seus países de origem e causar mais terror — declarou no domingo o porta-voz da coalizão, coronel Ryan Dillon.

1724,1,,"It was 130 years ago, on Oct. 28, 1886, that the Statue of Liberty was officially dedicated during a ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland. The celebration also included something that would eventually become a New York City tradition of its own: its first ticker-tape parade.

And the city had reason to celebrate: getting the Statue of Liberty there was no easy task.

Designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and inspired by French law professor Édouard René Lefèbvre de Laboulaye, the statue was initially called Liberty Enlightening the World and was meant as a gift from France to the United States, celebrating the country's independence. At first, the statue was assembled in pieces, with financing for the project proving to be difficult. The torch-bearing arm was first displayed in Philadelphia at the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and the head was exhibited at the Paris World's Fair in 1878. The statue was completed in France in 1884, but money was still needed to complete the pedestal in New York. Eventually, a donations drive spearheaded by publisher Joseph Pulitzer attracted over 100,000 contributions and the pedestal was finished by April 1886.

In the 20th century, the statue acted as a beacon of hope and emblem of welcome to the many immigrants who passed through nearby Ellis Island, while serving as a patriotic icon while the United States' fought World Wars I and II. But, even as its meaning evolved, the Statue of Liberty would continue to represent freedom in the United States—and, as TIME summed it up in 2009, become ""a fixture of New York City and a symbol for the nation.""

e       Firefox

que permite detectar e classificar direto do seu feed do Facebook as notícias como Legítimas,       Fake News, Click Bait, Extremamente Tendenciosa ou Sátira.

O Robinho se baseia na informação dada por nós humanos, e vai aprendendo com o tempo a classificar       automaticamente uma notícia como Fake News, Click Bait, etc, pelo seu texto. Com isso, mesmo novas       notícias que ninguém nunca viu poderão ser rapidamente classificadas.

Quanto mais você avalia as notícias, mais você contribui para a construção de uma base para       ensinar e melhorar o Robinho, que ainda está bem no início do seu desenvolvimento, veja, ele ainda       é um bebê robô:

Em 2016, durante a eleição dos Estados Unidos, muitos sites de fake news foram criados,       e propagados através das redes sociais, principalmente do Facebook, mas foram muitos,       muitos mesmo! Tanto que as Fake News tiveram

mais cliques que as notícias reais.

Só de baixar a extensão e sinalizar as notícias você já vai estar ajudando muito! Tanto outros       usuários, quanto no desenvolvimento do Robinho.

As tecnologias também são muito empolgantes: usamos Elm com WebExtensions para       a extensão, Rust para a API e Python para Machine Learning. Não conhece? Não tem problema, afinal o objetivo do       projeto é justamente aprender essas tecnologias enquanto ajuda o mundo.

Se quiser ajudar, dê uma olhada no nosso ROADMAP (em inglês) para entender a direção do projeto, e dê uma olhada também nas issues do github dos projetos.

1729,1,,"Note: We’ve read the email sent out by Jack Conte. We still endorse this letter in full, our demands have not changed, and we will continue gathering support. You can read our additional response to Jack, and Patreon, below the signatures, here.

We’re writing you today both as adult creators and concerned individuals about free, legal, expression. We’re deeply disappointed in your handling of clarity with regards to adult content on your platform, and the mixed messages we have been receiving. Not only that, the most vulnerable among us – disproportionately queer, trans, disabled, people of color and those whose first language is not English – are literally scared for our lives. After hard-won fandoms finally supporting us on Patreon, just one missed payment can mean homelessness.

Over the last couple years we have been courted by you, worked closely with you on promotion, creation, and even website features, and have been assured by you that Patreon was a home for all types of creators – including those that make adult content. And it’s been well reported that you were ending “payments discrimination against adult content” – something you proudly confirmed to us behind the scenes in one on one messages with your employees.

However, there has always been an issue with your stance on “porn” versus “adult content.” This stance has never been clear and is reminiscent of the phrase “I know it when I see it”, most infamously used in 1964 by Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart to describe his threshold test for obscenity. This is an outdated, legally unclear, and importantly, extremely problematic view of adult media.

This problem has only been brought further to the forefront in recent days, where you have long had a checkbox on your site that says “Content contains sexual imagery or nudity.”

Which now exists alongside new language in your October 17th update, to the Adult Content section, which says this:

“Lastly, you cannot sell pornographic material or arrange sexual service(s) as a reward for your patrons. You can’t use Patreon to raise funds in order to produce pornographic material such as maintaining a website, funding the production of movies, or providing a private webcam session.”

Which is exactly, as you well know, how many of your most popular creators operate. We send our patrons signed prints. We let them pick what kind of movie to make. It’s even how you’ve recommended we operate – using Patreon to fund a movie, or creating a website to reliably deliver rewards to our patrons! We’ve got the support conversations to back it up.

After an Engaget article covered these new developments, this was added:

Update: A Patreon spokesperson has clarified that its stance hasn’t changed, just the way it articulates the policy around pornography and other adult content. Which is to say that producers of pornography and sex workers more generally have always been “operating outside of the Community Guidelines.” The decision will leave a number of sex workers looking for yet another way to secure payment for their labor.

As we see it, this is further confirmation of a betrayal of your loyal creators and their loyal patrons. You’ve made a statement to cover yourself, but completely ignored those who generate the money on your platform and use it to pay their rents. Your platform strikes a pose in favor of freedom of expression, but there is no way your current contradictory stances can result in any sort of comfort to the creators. We hear buzz that like tech companies past, it’s all about funding and we worry that we’ll always be disposable people. We see that you’ve stated that you will “work with” creators to make sure their pages aren’t taken down, but that is not enough.

What is lost in that discussion is that the most vulnerable people will be the hardest to “work with”. These will disproportionately be queer, trans, and people of color. These will be creators less steeped in the language of “erotica” – just knowing that they want to create and entertain and that their skills lie in a sexual area. We must listen not just to creators trained in classic mediums, art school graduates, those fluent in theory and all the other ways that adult content is made palatable to the cultured class, we also must listen to and represent those who simply make porn. Who want to be creative with their porn, yes, but most importantly want to be self directed.

Your platform has given these people a light. We know people who would be homeless if it wasn’t for making porn on Patreon – and it’s not a small number. We know people who now employ many queer performers, workers, subcontractors – all working to make beautiful content. And while we understand the desire to police illegal content off the platform (and support it!), all of this legal content is beautiful. Who is it, at Patreon or anywhere, who decides what is art? When is there too much porn, not enough aesthetics?

Your fuzzy position on “adult content” vs. “porn” gives you the freedom to discriminate at will. And it makes content creators live in fear of that discrimination, itself leading to self censorship of important viewpoints.

We ask you to end this discrimination. Porn is a multi-billion dollar industry mostly in the hands of well heeled men. You were helping us hold it in our own hands. We ask you to take a stand on behalf of the sex workers who use your platform, their fans, and everyone who supports freedom of expression. Take a stand behind your creators who make revolutionary independant content. Stand behind your women and LGBT creators.

Do not go quietly down the path of least resistance and join every other platform we are discriminated against on. As journalist Violet Blue noted, “We are barred from Facebook, Instagram, Paypal, MailChimp, WordPress.org, Squarespace, Square, Kickstarter, Chase, Snapchat, AdWords.. Add that Tumblr and other sites make us unfindable. Now imagine trying to start or run a business and being unable to use these tools.”

To reiterate, we specifically ask that you:

Guarantee that adult content creators, of any legal content, will not have their sources of income revoked.

Keep your promises to adult content creators and end the system of arbitrarily judging what is and isn’t acceptable expression.

You at Patreon have been our friends in the tech world, you have told us so. Imagine how hard it must be for us to survive without the tools you had to start your business. Remember that our fan bases have been a pillar of your community and supported that very business. Lukewarm assurances that you’ll “work with us” are not enough – proudly stand with creators and their porn, or admit that you won’t be there for us.

Please do not abandon us.

Response to Jack Conte/Patreon’s response to this letter.

Media, please print in full if possible. Everyone else, feel free to reshare.

“We’ve read the email from Jack Conte. It continues to exemplify the exact problems we are writing about in our open letter and, in fact, makes them worse. He both moves to come out strongly against specific forms of expression, such as “real people engaging in sexual acts”, while going on at length about how good a home Patreon is to creators. And if we don’t agree it’s a good home, it’s ok because it only affects “very few creators”.

We will continue to stand in solidarity with any creator on the platform creating legal content and continue to demand that Patreon revise its stance to allow any legal adult content within a safe space on their site. We are sorry to hear that the way his company has handled our community “bugs” him, but it’s hard for us to have empathy for those in power while we are fighting simply to be heard, create, and survive.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that Patreon’s move today is the exact opposite of what we asked for. Patreon is saying that they believe sex workers unable to change or censor their work to fit new requirements should lose their income and that legal expressions of sexual creativity do not have a home on their platform.

This email exemplifies the mentality of Patreon and other tech companies that their image, perhaps to investors or banking partners, is more important than the wellbeing of the legal content creators who rely on Patreon as a source of income and one of the only “safe” spaces for us.

We will continue collecting support and will think about our next steps as unified creators. If you would like to stand in solidarity, you can do so here – www.openlettertopatreon.com”

1730,3,1.0,"[This guest commentary is by Avni Patel Thompson, founder and CEO of Poppy.]

There are things that I wish I had known before I had started my startups. Not because it would have changed my mind, but because I would have been prepared for them and I wouldn’t have obsessed over them.

Not the obvious, ambiguous things like — “It’s the hardest thing you’ve ever done” or “It’s the most rewarding.” The non-obvious, the in-the-trenches truths.

There are many, and everyone’s experience is different, but here are the five that I had wished I’d had a better sense of because they’re the ones that better capture the essence of being a founder on a daily basis:

Startups are not about products. They’re about wills. The will of one person or a team to do what everyone says can’t be done. To keep going. To find the source of faith, belief, inspiration that will create a bubble over your team to do the hard work. But it also means it’s your job to venture outside of the bubble every so often to make sure you haven’t drank your own Kool-aid too much and you’re now ignoring important realities. Talking to your users regularly solves that pretty easily. So be prepared to become your own cheerleader and your own worst critic – no one can do that for you.

Every day your mind wants to tell you all the ways that you don’t know what you’re doing. Just like athletes, your job becomes increasingly about managing your mental game. About funneling all your energies into what you can control. Which is your attitude, your focus, your willingness to talk to your customers relentlessly, to suspend disbelief while you do the work. You’ll have to actively shut the down the thoughts that try to crowd in at  by literally telling yourself you’re not allowed to think about this until your first cup of coffee.

This is the one that I most wish someone had warned me about. Being a founder means you’ve gotten obsessed by a complex, seemingly impossible problem. Which means you spend of your waking and many of your “sleeping” hours thinking about the problem, your team, the company, your competitors…. the list is endless, the thinking unending. So much so that it takes immense amounts of effort to constantly pull yourself back into the present — with your kids, your spouse, your friends. Essentially the most important people in your life, for whom you can start to feel distant and unengaged. When really, you’ve just fallen in love — with something that can’t be always ‘dimensionalized ‘or verbalized. It will be your job to adjust. To help your loved ones understand your obsession, but then also learn to set it aside so you don’t forsake your most important relationships.

If you’re lucky, you’ll have a partner or two in starting your venture. If not, you’ll need to get on building your team quickly. But not just anyone. And not just people who are smart — those are actually a dime a dozen. You need to find the grittiest, the most loyal ones. The smart ones with the heart and the will. It’s a tall order but you have to do it. Because these are the people that will see you at your best and very worst — when you’re erratic and anxious and frankly, a bit nuts. They’re also the ones that will know to just hold the boat steady and keep going to buy you the time to pull your s$%# together and focus again on point the ship in the right direction. Your team is your strength. Never forget that.

In the same way that language fails to really capture the feeling of your daughter’s hand in yours as she skips down the street or when you sit hip to hip with your spouse on the couch after a long day, quiet but content, language fails to communicate the highs and lows of starting a startup. I don’t think finding the words are necessary. Just know that you’ll feel feelings about your work that you never thought were possible — both joyful and devastating. Embrace them all.

Like startups, these are complex topics – neither all positive or negative. But I believe that we can make starting startups more accessible the more we can have the honest discussions of what it’s really like.

How about you? What do you wish you had known before starting your startup, launching your business or embarking on your creative project?

1732,1,,"Para o Tribunal Superior do Porto, bater em uma mulher adúltera é compreensível. É o que se deduz de uma sentença do órgão judicial no caso de uma mulher agredida pelo ex-marido e pelo ex-amante. ""O adultério da mulher é um gravíssimo atentado à honra e dignidade do homem. Na Bíblia, podemos ler que a mulher adúltera deve ser punida com a morte"", aponta a decisão judicial que determina a suspensão das penas de prisão impostas por outro tribunal.

O Ministério Público havia recorrido da sentença proferida por uma instância inferior na tentativa de obter penas mais duras contra dois homens que, em 2015, agrediram a ex-esposa e ex-amante. A mulher chegou a ser sequestrada pelo último, que chamou o ex-marido para que, juntos, a confrontassem. Na agressão usaram um martelo. O tribunal de primeira instância os condenou por violência doméstica. O ex-marido foi condenado a um ano e três meses de prisão e a pagar uma indenização de 1.750 euros (6.600 reais); o ex-amante, a um ano de prisão e 3.500 euros (13.000 reais) de multa. Mas as penas foram deixadas em suspenso.

Os juízes do Superior do Porto defendem os argumentos do tribunal anterior e recordam textos da Bíblia e do Código Penal de 1886, além de sociedades que punem o adultério da mulher com a pena de morte. ""Ainda não foi há muito tempo que a lei penal punia com uma pena pouco mais que simbólica o homem que, achando a sua mulher em adultério, neste ato a matasse"", escrevem os juízes Neto de Moura e Maria Luísa Arantes. ""Com estas referências pretende-se apenas acentuar que o adultério da mulher é uma conduta que a sociedade sempre condenou e condena fortemente (e são as mulheres honestas as primeiras a estigmatizar as adúlteras) e por isso vê com alguma compreensão a violência exercida pelo homem traído, vexado e humilhado pela mulher.""

O texto continua justificando a agressão: ""Foi a deslealdade e a imoralidade sexual da mulher que fez o arguido [neste caso o marido] cair em profunda depressão e foi nesse estado depressivo e toldado de revolta que praticou o ato de agressão, como bem se considerou na sentença recorrida.""

A sentença, datada de 11 de outubro, recebeu críticas vigorosas das organizações de direitos das mulheres e de diversas entidades judiciais. Elisabete Brasil, da União de Mulheres Alternativa e Resposta (UMAR), reagiu lembrando que ""muitas vezes as decisões judiciais ainda traduzem uma sociedade moralista"", e qualificou a sentença como ""retrógrada e machista"". Para a Ordem dos Advogados Portugueses, a decisão viola a Constituição.

Em comunicado à imprensa, o Conselho Superior da Magistratura declarou que ""nem todas as proclamações arcaicas, inadequadas ou infelizes constantes de sentenças assumem relevância disciplinar"".

1736,4,,"O site Ucho. Info fez muito bem ao lembrar da entrevista ao jornal Espanho “El Mundo”, na qual Lula disse o que eleitorado sentiu-se traído por Dilma Rousseff. Tudo bem que Lula não dise que sua sucessora tenha traído os eleitores. Mas isso não minimiza o caos econômico criado intencionalmente por Dilma.

Segundo o ex-metalúrgico, a sensação de traição por parte dos eleitores aconteceu no vácuo do ajuste fiscal promovido por Dilma Rousseff logo após a corrida presidencial de 2014, quando a petista conquistou o segundo mandato presidencial.

“As pessoas se sentiram traídas, porque não era aquilo que a gente tinha prometido durante a campanha”, disse Lula, passando uma rasteira em Dilma na tentativa de jogar para a galera.

Lula disse que outro “erro” de Dilma foi “exagerar” nas políticas de exoneração fiscal para grandes empresas. “Em 2014, saía mais dinheiro do que entrava”, afirmou o líder bolivariano.

“O ano de 2015 foi muito semelhante ao de 1999, quando Fernando Henrique Cardoso teve uma popularidade de 8% e o Brasil quebrou três vezes. Mas o presidente da Câmara era Michel Temer e ele o ajudou. Nós tivemos o Eduardo Cunha”.

A constatação do Ucho. Info é certeira:

No momento em que reconhece ter sido um erro exagerar nas políticas de desoneração fiscal – o que provocou maior saída de recursos do que entrada –, Lula chancela o impeachment da sucessora, algo que os “companheiros” continuam classificando como golpe. O impeachment de Dilma Rousseff se deu por causa de crime de responsabilidade fiscal, fruto da desastrada política econômica adotada pela petista.

O processo de impedimento de Dilma Rousseff respeito a legislação vigente, o devido processo legal e o amplo direito de defesa, como sabem os brasileiros coerentes. Se no vácuo da mencionada declaração os “camaradas” não mudarem o discurso sobre o impeachment, Lula mais uma vez terá protagonizado espetáculo pífio para salvar o PT e se fazer de vitima.

Lula detonou Dilma. Não há mais espaço para a narrativa de que “impeachment foi golpe”. Golpe foi o governo Dilma.

1737,4,,"Todo mundo trabalhou para minar a campanha de João Doria nas últimas semanas. Setores da campanha do Bolsonaro acreditam que demolir Doria é o melhor jogo. Os petistas também estão investindo nisso. A campanha de Geraldo Alckmin trabalhar para enterrar o prefeito. E, como não poderia deixar de ser, a própria campanha de Doria anda dando vários tiros no pé.

Como presente, a turma toda ganhou uma candidatura muito mais forte e muito mais carregada de esquerdismo: Luciano Huck. Agora é o famoso ditado adaptado: “quem pariu Huck que o embale”.

Conforme o Estadão, o jogo de Luciano Huck agora é empacotar sua candidatura de esquerda – estilo Rede/PSOL – para engabelar parte da direita. Por isso ele está envolvendo até gente como o empresário Eduardo Mufarej, e o ex-presidente do Banco Central Armínio Fraga.

Mas a parte mais inovadora é que ele vai oferecer cursos de formação para jovens com formação ideológica estilo Rede/PSOL para conquistarem o máximo possível de vagas no Legislativo em 2018.

“O nosso foco é o Legislativo, mas não se trata de um movimento nem de direita, nem de esquerda”, disse Mufarej, mentor do projeto e sócio da Tarpon Investimentos. “Queremos tentar aproximar o Brasil, e não dividir. Existe gente competente nos diferentes espectros ideológicos.”

Ou seja, o famoso truque “nem, nem”, utilizado pelo partido de extrema esquerda do Rede.

A matéria do Estadão diz:

Desde o último dia 7, o RenovaBR recebeu 600 interessados em participar de suas aulas. As inscrições terminam no fim deste mês e serão escolhidos até 150 participantes para o programa. Deste total, o grupo acredita que poderá lançar cerca de cem candidatos a deputado – a maioria a federal -, em 2018. Há também um esforço para que mais mulheres entrem na corrida eleitoral.

Os selecionados receberão ajuda de custo equivalente a uma bolsa de estudo – de janeiro a junho de 2018 – para se dedicar ao aprimoramento político. As disciplinas oferecidas estão ancoradas em temas como ética, democracia, funcionamento do Estado, planejamento, estratégia e liderança.

Além de Luciano Huck – também padrinho do movimento Agora! – e de Armínio Fraga, o empresário Abílio Diniz é outro entusiasta do RenovaBR. Dos 60 voluntários que integram essa rede, a maioria é composta por empresários e profissionais liberais.

Na verdade, os “liberais” ligados a Huck são LINO’s, ou seja, “liberals in name only”. É aquela mesma turma que quer proibir as pessoas de protestarem contra crianças tocando em corpos de homens nus. Obviamente, não querem que o cidadão se arma. É uma gente que não admite falar em redução de maioridade penal.

Quem quer que acredite que essa turma é “liberal” ou está se fazendo se sonso ou pirou de vez.

A presença de Huck no jogo cria um núcleo de extrema esquerda no padrão Rede/PSOL com o apoio da Rede Globo e uma plataforma que deixa gente como Marcelo Freixo e Luciana Genro emocionada.

Isso aumenta nossa pressão para derrubar Luciano Huck quase na mesma medida em que temos que derrubar Lula. Para Jair Bolsonaro, a pressão é total, uma vez que ele fica naquela situação de “ou vence ou vence”.

Uma vez que boa parte de suas tropas ajudaram a aniquilar Doria, ele não tem nenhum direito moral do perder para Huck. Que isso sirva como motivação adicional para uma vitória sobre Huck.

1738,1,,"Depois da Amazon começar a vender eletrônicos, outro rumor de longa data está se concretizando em outubro. A Nubank confirmou nesta terça (24) que vai passar a oferecer serviços bancários.

A NuConta é uma conta  digital que traz alguns atrativos extras para atrair os clientes. Assim como outros serviços do tipo, ela traz a facilidade de ser gerenciada por uma aplicativo. Transferências de dinheiro entre NuContas e entre bancos diferentes (TED) poderão ser feitas pelo app sem o pagamento de taxas.

A novidade está em uma modalidade de investimento que a conta traz. Todo o dinheiro depositado na NuConta vai render uma porcentagem por mês. A promessa é de que a taxa seja bem mais atraente do que as poupanças tradicionais.

No entanto, pelo menos nesta primeira fase, a conta não traz algumas funções. Por enquanto, não é possível agendar o pagamento de contas. Também não será possível fazer o pagamentos de boletos pelo aplicativo. A empresa já está desenvolvendo estes recursos, mas eles ainda não têm data para serem implementados.

A surpresa ficou por conta do saque. Não é possível retirar o dinheiro da conta usando o cartão de débito, apenas o cartão de crédito. A empresa parece não estar disposta a incluir esta função. Em entrevista ao Tecnoblog, Cristina Junqueira, uma das fundadores do Nubank, disse que “não é garantido que as pessoas realmente precisam disso”. Isso tem a ver com a categoria do serviço. A NuConta não é uma conta corrente de fato, mas uma conta de pagamento. Burocracia do Banco Central.

O objetivo da Nubank é ambicioso. Ela quer atingir 100% do país. Para isso ela traz algumas facilidades de abertura, como não fazer a análise de crédito.

Por enquanto, a NuConta está em fase de testes. Primeiro ela vai ser liberada para alguns clientes antigos do cartão roxo. Claro que a empresa já abriu cadastro para novos contatos. Por isso é provável que ela usará o esquema de fila adotado pelo cartão de crédito.

1740,1,,"RIO — Uma aluna da escola Univest de Lages, em Santa Catarina, foi suspensa por dois dias e teve a matrícula vetada para o próximo ano depois de divulgar e criticar um panfleto da instituição. O ofício anunciava a proibição de ensino de sexo, ideologia de gênero, ativismo LGBT, comunismo, esquerdismo e religião em sala de aula. ""2017, a nova idade média. (Pasmem, isso é real)"", escreveu a adolescente de 17 anos nas redes sociais.

No dia seguinte à publicação, que recebeu mais de 523 compartilhamentos até a tarde desta quinta-feira, a jovem foi chamada à coordenação da escola e avisada de que seria sancionada por ""denegrir a imagem do colégio nas redes sociais"". Uma amiga também sofreu penalidades e teve a bolsa de estudos cortada.

— Os alunos estavam comentando e compartilhando. Na quarta-feira de manhã, eu e mais uma aluna (que comentou na postagem) recebemos suspensões por denegrir a imagem do colégio. Eles falaram que era errado a gente expor o colégio. Eu não reconheço essa suspensão, porque ela é sem sentido. Minha mãe também não. Ela ficou indignada. Isso desencoraja os alunos a exporem sua opinião. Um ato de retrocesso — destacou a estudante.

A jovem explicou que o ofício foi entregue em sala durante uma aula como um ""recado a alunos e pais"" e considerou uma surpresa ver a instituição proibir os temas. No bimestre passado, a classe aprendeu sobre as diversas religiões, por exemplo, segundo ela. Proibida de renovar a matrícula em 2018, a adolescente pensa em trocar de escola.

Mãe da estudante, a fisioterapeuta Fabiana Cruz relatou a surpresa em ler o recado, enviado pela filha por mensagem. As duas discordavam do conteúdo por considerar que são temas atuais e que os alunos precisam desenvolver senso crítico. A adolescente revelou à mãe o desejo de rebater o ofício nas redes sociais. Fabiana alertou que haveria uma consequência. Ainda assim, ela conta que não imaginou a proporção das penalidades impostas à estudante.

— Quando ela me passou a foto do panfleto, não acreditei que era da escola. Falei que era incabível para a época de hoje, são temas que estão aí. Não iremos matriculá-la (no próximo ano) porque é inadmissível. É para podar todo mundo. Somos totalmente contra, estamos pensando em entrar com uma ação. Ela está perdendo aula. Amanhã vou fazê-la ir à escola, vou entrar com ela na sala de aula — frisou Fabiana.

Procurado, Giovani Broering, o reitor do Centro Universitário Facvest — ao qual a Univest fica submetida — ficou de retornar aos contatos da reportagem, mas ainda não o fez. Ao Diário Catariense, ele argumentou que ""toda ação tem uma consequência"".

1742,1,,"O relator da Comissão Parlamentar de Inquérito (CPI) da Previdência, senador Hélio José  (PROS-DF), apresentou nesta segunda-feira (23) o relatório final dos trabalhos ao colegiado, com a conclusão de que a Previdência Social não é deficitária, mas, sim, alvo de má gestão.

Segundo o senador, “está havendo manipulação de dados por parte do governo para que seja aprovada a reforma da Previdência”. Ele acrescentou que “quando o assunto é Previdência, há uma série de cálculos forçados e irreais”.

Em 253 páginas, o relatório destaca que o “maior e mais grave problema da Previdência Social vem da vulnerabilidade e da fragilidade das fontes de custeio do sistema de seguridade social”. No documento, o relator destaca que, “antes de falar em déficit, é preciso corrigir distorções”.

Outro trecho do documento ressalta que “a lei, ao invés de premiar o bom contribuinte, premia a sonegação e até a apropriação indébita, com programas de parcelamento de dívidas (Refis), que qualquer cidadão endividado desse país gostaria de poder acessar.

Ao contrário da maioria das CPIs, que, segundo Hélio José, ao final costumam pedir o indiciamento de pessoas, desta vez, o relatório é apenas propositivo. Nesse sentido, sugere dois projetos de lei (PLS) e três propostas de emenda constitucional (PECs). Uma delas proíbe a aplicação da Desvinculação de Receitas da União às receitas da seguridade social.

Após um pedido de vista coletiva – mais tempo para analisar o parecer – o relatório precisa ser votado até o dia 6 de novembro, quando termina o prazo de funcionamento da comissão. Antes da votação final os membros da CPI podem sugerir mudanças no documento.

Instalada no fim de abril , em pouco mais de seis meses, a CPI realizou 26 audiências públicas e ouviu mais de 140 pessoas entre representantes de órgãos governamentais, sindicatos, associações, empresas, além de membros do Ministério Público e da Justiça do Trabalho, deputados, auditores, especialistas e professores. A comissão é presidida pelo senador Paulo Paim (PT-RS), e é formada por seis senadores titulares e cinco suplentes.

1747,1,,"Se você estava atrás de um convite do TIM Beta, eis uma boa notícia: a operadora está distribuindo convites para alguns dos seus clientes pré-pago que realizarem uma recarga de R$ 100 através deste site promocional.

Atualização às 20:16: o regulamento da promoção foi alterado e agora informa que apenas clientes TIM pré-pago selecionados que receberam o SMS com o link da recarga poderão receber o convite. No entanto, a operadora informou ao Tecnoblog que ocorrerá uma ação no Facebook que distribuirá 1.000 convites para qualquer pessoa que está cadastrada na plataforma do TIM Beta.

A promoção vai até 31/10/2017. Serão disponibilizados 10 mil convites para quem fizer uma recarga de R$ 100 através do site da promoção. Se os convites acabarem antes de 31/10, a promoção poderá ser encerrada. Após realizar a recarga, o cliente receberá uma SMS com um link para realizar a migração de plano. O convite é válido por 10 dias.

Segundo o regulamento, a promoção é válida para atuais clientes da TIM no pré-pago. Você conseguirá realizar a recarga caso seja cliente de um plano controle, mas não receberá o convite. Nesse caso, é importante pedir a alteração para um plano pré, e só efetuar a recarga após a efetivação da mudança.

A grande vantagem é que o valor da recarga fica disponível para o cliente mesmo após ser migrado para o TIM Beta. Se você optar por participar da campanha e aderir ao plano Beta Mensal, terá crédito suficiente para 2 meses de uso.

É importante salientar que a promoção só é disponível para quem fizer a recarga apenas pelo site da promoção, via cartão de crédito. Além disso, nem todo mundo consegue realizar o pagamento de R$ 100 logo de cara: um sistema antifraude da TIM exige que as primeiras recargas desse sistema tenha valores inferiores a R$ 50. (Se você já tem o costume de fazer recargas via cartão de crédito pelo site da operadora, não deve enfrentar problemas.)

No TIM Beta, o pacote mensal custa R$ 50 e traz 10 GB de internet, 600 minutos para qualquer operadora do Brasil e SMS ilimitado, além de acesso ao TIMmusic by Deezer. Para quem atinge a pontuação do Beta Lab, a franquia de internet aumenta para 20 GB e 2.000 minutos mensais em ligações para qualquer operadora.

A TIM entrou em contato com o Tecnoblog e informou uma nova ação que ocorrerá nesta segunda-feira (23): serão disponibilizados mil convites através da página do TIM Beta no Facebook. O convite será válido para quem já está cadastrado no site do TIM Beta e ainda não possui o plano.

Portanto, se você quer um convite para o plano, essa é uma ótima chance e não exige recarga mínima. O cadastro pode ser feito tanto por clientes TIM ou não-clientes, e os convites serão enviados até o dia 06/11. Quem se cadastrar na campanha mas não se enquadrar dentro dos 1.000 primeiros receberá um e-mail de retorno.

Sobre isso vou dizer algo que sempre pontuo no consultório:  Considerando as definições atuais de magreza, que são extremamente inflexíveis, não é nem um pouco difícil ser ""gorda"". Não que gorda seja algo feio ou errado, mas se o seu referencial de corpo aceitável for uma atriz global, você certamente irá passar a vida se queixando de ser uma ""baleia"". ""Corpo maravilhoso"" é algo muito discutível, mas quando uma mulher come normalmente e de acordo com as necessidades do corpo o resultado é um organismo saudável com peso estável. Neste caso, queira a pessoa ou não, são fortes as chances de que seja um corpo bem diferente do da capa da revista. Você é tão responsável pela sua constituição física quanto pela cor de seus olhos. Não adianta dar murro em ponta de faca. Se a magreza que você tanto sonha tem o preço de uma vida de privação, será muito complicado viver assim por muito tempo. #NSE #Dieta #NutriçãoComportamental #CorpoPerfeito",1,267,Este comentário apareceu hoje aqui na página.,https://www.facebook.com/Naosouexposicao/photos/a.542050849203648.1073741828.542031755872224/1648350555240333/?type=3,,
1758,1,,"Além da ONU, a Plataforma Sinergia, que produz a farinata, usou a logomarca de pelo menos cinco empresas, instituições e associações sem autorização, como se tivesse com elas parcerias que nunca existiram.

A FAO, agência da ONU (Organização das Nações Unidas) para alimentação e agricultura, negou qualquer tipo de apoio ou relação com a chamada ""farinata"" que a gestão do prefeito de São Paulo, João Doria, quer distribuir em equipamentos públicos, como albergues e escolas.

A fabricante da farinata, o Instituto Plataforma Sinergia, informa em seu site atual que a FAO é colaboradora da iniciativa. No site antigo do instituto, a agência da ONU aparece como parceira. Nas duas páginas a fabricante da farinata usa o logo da FAO para dar mais credibilidade à ação.

Em entrevista à CBN, ao sair em defesa da farinata, a secretaria de Direitos Humanos da gestão Doria, Eloisa Arruda, afirmou que o produto ganhou um concurso mundial feito pela FAO e que, portanto, já foi reconhecido pela ONU.

""Esse alimento foi submetido a um concurso mundial que foi feito pela FAO. Concorreu com 170 compostos nutricionais, e ele ganhou o prêmio. Foi considerado o melhor do mundo para suprir carências nutricionais. Ele já foi reconhecido pela Nações Unidas. É um alimento que foi testado e tem aprovação de uma agência internacional da ONU.""

A reportagem da CBN procurou a representação da FAO no Brasil. A sede da agência, que fica em Roma, foi acionada. Durante três dias, a entidade pesquisou nos seus arquivos se, em algum momento, houve alguma relação de parceria ou apoio à farinata, mas nada encontrou. Ao contrário disso, a FAO informou que não concedeu nenhum prêmio à farinata, nem possui qualquer relação com a iniciativa.

A reportagem da CBN conversou por telefone, neste sábado, com a secretária Eloisa Arruda, mas ela não quis gravar entrevista.

Já a prefeitura respondeu que as informações sobre o reconhecimento da farinata em âmbito internacional estão em documentos apresentados pela Plataforma Sinergia.

Além da FAO, a Plataforma Sinergia usou a logomarca de pelo menos cinco empresas, instituições e associações sem autorização, como se tivesse com elas parcerias que nunca existiram.

Na capa do site da Sinergia uma foto de crianças africanas pedindo comida e uma imagem do Papa Francisco dividem espaço com o número de uma conta bancária para receber doações. Eles dizem que, a cada R$ 10, você mantém uma criança nutrida por um mês.

Pra dar mais credibilidade ao pedido, uma seção do site traz um rol de logomarcas dos supostos colaboradores da fabricante da ""farinata"". Quatro são vinculados à igreja católica e outros 12 de entidades variadas.

Procuradas pela CBN, cinco dessas entidades negaram qualquer tipo de parceria com a Plataforma Sinergia.

A Abad (Associação Brasileira de Atacadistas e Distribuidores de Produtos Industrializados) e a Bemis do Brasil disseram que até havia uma possibilidade de parceria no passado, mas que isso não avançou.

O Sesi e o Senai, da Fiesp (Federação das Indústrias de São Paulo), disseram que nunca tiveram qualquer relação com a empresa e pediram a retirada do logotipo. A Câmara Internacional de Comércio também negou que colabore com a produtora da ""farinata"".

Criticada por nutricionistas, a empresa também usou indevidamente a marca do Consea (Conselho Estadual de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional Sustentável), que negou qualquer tipo de parceria.

O Ministério do Meio Ambiente também aparece como apoiador da iniciativa, mas o que há é apenas uma carta de resposta a um convite para um evento, enviada pela ex-ministra Isabella Teixeira em dezembro de 2013, sem relação com a atual gestão da pasta.

A dona da empresa, Rosana Perrotti, não quis gravar entrevista. Ela diz que cogita tirar as logomarcas do site porque a repercussão na mídia estaria incomodando os supostos apoiadores. Ela disse ainda que tem mais de 200 parceiros, mas que não pode nomeá-los por questões de confidencialidade.

De acordo com as investigações, o tiroteio era premeditado e motivado por bullying. Foi relatado que colegas de classe o chamavam de ""fedido"", por não usar desodorante.

Em depoimento, o atirador afirma que tinha intenção de matar apenas o colega autor do bullying, mas no momento do ataque, sentiu vontade de fazer mais vítimas. À Folha, colegas de classe relataram que o estudante tinha inimizade com João Pedro.

Com a grande repercussão, a mãe da vítima decidiu se pronunciar no Instagram no último sábado (21). ""A vida e suas reticências... não vou reclamar meu Papai do Céu...

1764,3,1.0,"Todo mundo que tem um cachorro conhece esta situação muito bem: você está passeando com seu bichinho quando, de repente, ele para, começa a andar em círculos, até que finalmente deixa um presentinho marrom na grama.

Porém, ao invés de se concentrar totalmente na sua tarefa, ele te olha bem fundo nos olhos. Caso você já tenha se perguntado o porquê deste comportamento bizarro, você está prestes a ter algumas respostas.

Em 2009, cientistas conduziram um estudo sobre o contato visual entre cães e seres humanos. Desse modo, eles foram capazes de descobrir que o olhar mútuo produz uma reação fisiológica similar a que acontece entre uma mãe e seus filhos. Isso significa que seu cão te vê como uma figura paterna/materna e você, embora sem pensar, o enxerga como uma criança sob seus cuidados.

Mas existem outras causas possíveis. Quando são filhotes, a maior parte dos cachorros recebe um carinho extra do seu dono cada vez que faz suas necessidades do lado de fora de casa ou no lugar designado. Assim que o processo de aprendizado é concluído, estas recompensas cessam, mas os cãezinhos nunca perdem a esperança de serem ainda aplaudidos e agraciados com algo. Justamente por isso, ele fixa em você um olhar profundo e pidão na hora H de fazer o seu número 2.

Uma outra hipótese é a de que ele esteja em busca de confirmação. ""Posso fazer isso aqui?"", seria a pergunta por trás do olhar especial. Ao longo dos anos, certamente alguma vez aconteceu dele estar prestar a deixar uma 'bomba' em algum lugar inapropriado e acabar sendo repreendido. Então é possivel que ele não tenha esquecido tal episódio e esteja com medo de errar outra vez.

Outra possível causa é o instinto do cão de se manter sempre vigilante. O cachorro sabe que nesta posição semi-agachada ele está mais vulnerável e te olha para garantir que você está também alerta e irá protegê-lo caso algum ataque ocorra por trás. Em outras palavras: você é o super herói do seu amigo peludo!

Mas deixando a ciência de lado, talvez o seu cachorro te olhe simplesmente porque você fica prestando atenção nele durante este ato indigno. Neste caso, o seu melhor amigo poderia estar, na verdade, te fazendo um pedido silencioso: 'me deixe em paz, por favor'. Será que é por isso que os cachorros nos seguem quando vamos ao banheiro? Este comportamento poderia ser uma esperta vingança contra a falta de privacidade. Afinal, quem gosta de ser observado no momento de atender ao chamado da natureza?

Brincadeiras à parte, independentemente das razões que levam os cães a se comportarem assim, uma coisa é certa: o seu cachorro confia em você e te enxerga como o líder da matilha.

Com toda esta dedicação a seus donos, estes bichinhos merecem ser muito amados. Compartilhe este artigo com seus amigos que também gostam de animais. Assim eles podem entender melhor seus fiéis companheiros peludos!

1766,3,1.0,"The end of the Peter Capaldi era of Doctor Who is rapidly approaching with the debut of The Christmas Episode entitled “Twice Upon a Time.” Christmas Day marks the time for The Doctor’s regeneration and fans are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the 13th incarnation of the beloved character. While Season 10 faced mixed reviews, Season 11 looks promising with the confirmation of drastic changes being made to the franchise such as a new showrunner and alterations to two of The Doctor’s main accessories. Whovians are also keeping their fingers crossed concerning rumors about the new season involving possible returning characters and a famous director taking on an episode.

RELATED: The 15 Craziest Star Wars: The Last Jedi Fan Theories (That Might Actually Come True)

For those new to Who, the British sci-fi drama is about a time traveling alien known as The Doctor who travels the universe protecting Earth from otherworldly threats. Dedicated to helping those in need, The Doctor is aided in his (or indeed her) adventures by human companions. For 54 years, the franchise has grown in popularity, gaining a cult following in the United States. Proud “Whovians” have witnessed 12 incarnations of the beloved main character and are excited for what the new season will bring. Below are facts about the upcoming season along with rumors fans are hoping will come true.

For the first time in 54 years, the BBC announced The Doctor will be played by a woman. Since its beginning, Doctor Who portrayed the character as a male and casting speculations strongly suggested that it would remain that way. Jodie Whittaker’s reveal as the Thirteenth Doctor was announced in a short introduction video in mid-July and was met with strong opinions. While many embraced the change, “traditional” fans were upset that the show veered off its established path.

Whittaker welcomed reviews saying, “I want to tell fans not to be scared of my gender. This is a really exciting time and Doctor Who represents everything that’s exciting about change. The fans have lived through so many changes, and this is only a new, different one, not a fearful one.” Capaldi’s regeneration is expected to happen “during the last two minutes of action” in the Christmas episode according to DoctorWhoTV.

Speaking of male companions, fan favorite Nardole is still on the fence about whether he is staying or leaving. The actor, Matt Lucas, suggested,  “I do know the answer to that question. I’ve known the answer to that question for a while, but I can’t tell you the answer I’m afraid.” The actor has remained tight-lipped when it comes to revealing potential spoilers, fearing, “if I talk to one person, then I’ll panic.”

He says, “the less I knew, the better because it’s hard to keep secrets. I might, for instance, know all sorts of things about various personnel in the future, but I’d rather I didn’t.” Does “various personnel” include him? It has already been confirmed that along with Capaldi, Michelle Gomez (Missy) and Pearl Mackie (Bill Potts) will be departing but as for beloved Nardole, his future is still unclear. His full statement can be found on Express.co.uk.

Michelle Gomez, who played the female regeneration of the Time Lord’s greatest enemy, the Master, will be bidding farewell. Speaking exclusively with DigitalSpy.com, Gomez revealed her devotion to Capaldi saying ““… I don’t know how I feel about being The Master to any other Doctor, because I feel like I’m part of Peter’s time.” The actress made her debut in “Deep Breath” as a mischievous Mary Poppins-esque rival of The Doctor who often toyed with his emotions, delicately balancing herself on the thin line between good and evil.

Gomez hasn’t ruled out a complete departure from the show, teasing, “’I’m sure in a couple of years’ time, the urge to blow things up will just be too strong and Missy will come in guns blazing!” but admits “… at the moment, it just feels like this is the end of an era…”

Fans always look forward to the possibility of their favorite characters returning to their beloved franchise. While nothing’s been confirmed yet, Dead Beats Panel has thrown out a few names. Among them are Osgood and Ashildr / “Me.”

Making her appearance in “The Day of the Doctor,” Osgood was introduced as a UNIT scientist and The Doctor’s #1 fan. In the 50th anniversary episode, she had the pleasure of meeting both the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. If UNIT calls upon The Doctor again, perhaps their paths will cross once more. Played by Game of Thrones alum Massie Williams, Ashildr is a Viking who sacrifices herself when aliens invade her village. With The Doctor’s help, she becomes a functioning immortal and travels the universe under the alias “Me.” Williams has stated her character’s return is not expected though not entirely ruled out.

One of The Doctor’s signature accessories, the sonic screwdriver has had as many updates and new applications as today’s iPhone. Early versions of the device were used for simpler tasks such as lock picking and projecting sound. Over the years, each incarnation of the Doctor has made their own modifications. This allowed for wider functionality, which included computer hacking, medical scanning, and moderate defense against certain weapons. Despite its advancements, the screwdriver often proved useless in certain situations. It is unable to open deadlock seals and is ineffective against wood.

As the Twelfth Doctor, Capaldi abandoned the technology in favor of “sonic sunglasses” and continued to wear them after he was rendered temporarily blind after exposure to the vacuum of space in “Oxygen.” No word yet has been made as far as specific designs for the Thirteenth Doctor’s screwdriver but one is expected to be created.

For years, director of The Lord of the Rings franchise, Peter Jackson has been teasing Doctor Who fans that he would love to direct an episode. A lifelong fan of the show, Jackson posted a video on Facebook teasing Steven Moffat has been trying to contact him regarding directing an episode. In the background, you can see a confused Peter Capaldi as The Doctor making his way around the room, insisting he is looking for a director.

It’s not clear whether the video was a clever collaboration to mess with Whovians or an unofficial announcement that he’s involved in the creation of an episode. According to DenOfGeek.com, Moffat has admitted that he’s “spoken to [Peter Jackson] face to face, and he would like to do one,” and “”He accepts that… it would have to be when he’s available… I think it will probably happen at some point.”

At a Doctor Who panel at San Diego Comic-Con, Pearl Mackie revealed her time as Bill Potts will come to an end after the Christmas episode. The actress received mixed reviews when it was announced that she would play the first openly gay companion to The Doctor, suffering backlash from critics who were quick to disagree pointing out pansexual Jack Harkness, lesbian Madame Vastra and the previous companion Clara Oswald, who gave an impression that she was possibly bisexual.

In the season finale, Potts was converted into a Cyberman but was then reunited with her “alien girlfriend” Heather. It is confirmed that she will return in the Christmas episode to say farewell to her Doctor but it’s not clear whether she will witness his regeneration.

“Hello Sweetie.” Will Whovians ever hear those words again? Kickass archeologist River Song was introduced in the two-part episode “Silence in the Library” and “Forest of the Damned.” Her connection to The Doctor was unclear at the time. It wasn’t until the Eleventh Doctor that she was revealed to be the daughter of his companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams, and his wife. Their non-linear paths made their encounters hard to follow, even with Song’s diary detailing their experiences together.

Her final appearance was in “The Husbands of River Song,” spending her final moments on a romantic date with The Twelfth Doctor. In Doctor Who Magazine (#509), when asked if her story ended, Moffat said “Well, yes, that does seem like the end to me. Except, of course, it isn’t, and can’t be. There’s always the chance that River will show up again, at some other point in her timeline…”

The Doctor isn’t the only one that gets upgraded for the new season. Various news sources strongly suggest that the Tardis is getting a makeover as well. Since the show’s beginning, the interior of the Doctor’s traveling phone box has changed almost as much as the Doctor.

While it remained consistent for 26 years, the show’s 2005 revival introduced a much quirkier industrial look and continued to alter itself. The Eleventh Doctor’s Tardis remodeled itself after being heavily damaged and settled for a retro design with shiny gizmos and gadgets while the Twelfth Doctor went for a sleek, modern look that featured silver and dark blue accents. There has been no word yet as far as specific design plans for the Thirteenth Doctor’s Tardis though fans suspect a possible tease might reveal itself in the Christmas Episode.

According to MoviePilot.com, an assumption has been made that Season 11 won’t premiere until next year. This highly likely rumor gained traction due to the late filming of the new season beginning in January of 2018. The new season is expected to consist of 13 episodes, including a Christmas special. This time frame would allow the BBC plenty of time to decide on the perfect companion for the new regeneration.

If this rumor is to be believed, it would suggest the season will be broken down into two parts. The first half would possibly consist of a huge story arc to either be resolved in the Christmas episode or in the second half which would air in early to mid- spring. Moffat firmly stated to Broadcast, “It’s critical that when Doctor Who launches, it’s the television event in that area.”

Drastic changes are expected for this new season; one of the most talked about is the fact that the series, according to The Mirror, “will run for 10 weeks rather than the usual 12 or 13, but each programme will last a full hour instead of 45 minutes.” While fans might be disappointed by a shorter season, longer episodes suggest more time will be dedicated to increased action, dramatic dialogue and more intriguing storylines.

In its early years, episodes of Doctor Who ran for only 25 minutes. The first episode premiered the day after John F Kennedy’s assassination; the show designed to appeal to families and use time travels as a means to educate people about certain scientific ideas and important moments in history. The 2005 revival of the series is a direct continuation of the events of the original 1963-1989 series.

Since the show is about a time-traveling alien, it’s common knowledge that many of the episodes take place during different time periods — past, present and future. An insider for the series reported to The Mirror that fans should “expect something fresh and brilliant, with more stories traveling backwards in time, to interesting historical eras, as well as forwards.” If the overarching arc theory is to be believed, perhaps The Doctor will be pursuing someone or something throughout time or the series will feature episodes heavily emphasizing certain historical events that might be in danger of being altered.

Throughout his journeys, The Doctor has encountered many historical figures. While the early episodes used history as means of education, the revival of the series introduced more frequent episodes of historical significance and told the stories of real people, including Vincent Van Gogh, Charles Dickens and Madame de Pompadour.

Showrunner Steven Moffat announced last year that he would no longer be writing for Doctor Who and would be leaving the show in the capable hands of Chris Chibnall who won three BAFTAs for his detective series Broadchurch. Speaking of his departure, Moffat said “… the fact is my timey wimey is running out” and expressed his excitement “that one of the true stars of British Television drama will be taking the Time Lord even further into the future” in an interview with The Radio Times.

As a Whovian himself, Chibnall expressed his devotion to the show saying, “Doctor Who is the ultimate BBC programme: bold, unique, vastly entertaining, and adored all around the world. So it’s a privilege and a joy to be the next curator of this funny, scary and emotional family drama.”

The Doctor is known for traveling with a wide variety of companions, both human and non-human. An official announcement of the new companion has yet to be made though various sources have settled on two top contenders. In the lead is Bradley Walsh, a British gameshow host. The Mirror prematurely announced in August that Walsh has been confirmed as the new companion, saying a source close to the actor revealed “Bradley is super excited to be joining the cast of Doctor Who in such a key role.”

Another contender is Kris Marshall, who was rumored to be in the running for the Thirteenth Doctor but was quickly ruled out after Whittaker’s announcement. The Sun reports a source close to the actor said, “Kris is a big fan of the show and the BBC are a big fan of his.”

RadioTimes.com exclusively revealed that the BBC program would be adopting an “American practice” of using a writing room to brainstorm ideas for episodes and scripts. A spokesperson for the BBC stated, “It’s still very early days and no fixed model has been decided upon yet. Chris Chibnall as the new showrunner will write his own episodes and is currently exploring different ways of working with new and established writers on the show.”

DigitalSpy.com reports that Chibnall is interested in the new system where, as the leader of the group, he would assist in “hashing out storylines for each series together [with the writers].” Whether this system will actually be put into place is still questionable, though it has been made clear that Chibnall has a bold five-year plan for Doctor Who, confirming “a series-long arc is definitely possible.”

1769,1,,"O sargento do Exército Carlos Alberto de Almeida, de 46 anos, considerado o maior armeiro do tráfico de drogas do Rio de Janeiro, foi preso por policiais da Delegacia Especializada em Armas, Munições e Explosivos (Desarme) na Favela da Coreia, em Senador Camará, Zona Oeste, na noite desta sexta-feira. Outras três pessoas envolvidas na mesma facção criminosa também fora presas com ele: Alexsandro Rodrigues Figueira, de 34 anos; Felipe Rodrigues Fugueira, de 31; e Murilo Barbosa Ludigerio, de 22. As informações foram divulgadas pela Polícia Civil.

O quarteto foi preso em flagrante delito no momento que fabricavam peças de armas de fogo e realizavam a montagem de fuzis que seriam entregues aos chefes do tráfico de drogas de uma das principais facções criminosas do Rio (TCP), com operação na Vila Aliança, Coréia, Vila dos Pinheiros, Parada de Lucas , Serrinha, Dendê e outras da Baixada Fluminense. De acordo com o delegado titular da Desarme, Fabricio Oliveira, cada um colaborava com uma função específica: no torno mecânico, na pintura das armas, na compra de peças, entre outras atividades, mas sempre comandados pelo militar.

- É muito prematuro dar informações precisas sobre a origem de cada arma de fogo, carregadores e munição, além de outras peças. Em um primeiro momento, porém, não há indício de que o sargento tenha desviado esse material do Exército. Ele próprio nega que já tenha feito isso. O trabalho era pegar armamento defeituoso, um fuzil quebrado, e colocar em condições melhores, ou instalar equipamentos novos - afirmou.

Segundo Oliveira, o sargento relatou ainda que o envolvimento dele com o tráfico teve início em um momento que passava por dificuldades financeiras:

- Ele relatou que, após dificuldades financeiras, diz que teria sido vítima de uma saidinha de banco, acabou realizando trabalhos para o tráfico na Vila Aliança há alguns anos. E isso foi se estreitando - contou.

Conhecido também como Soldado, Mauricinho ou Professor, Alemida era lotado na Escola de Sargentos de Logística do Exército Brasileiro (ESSLOG) e, por mais de 25 anos, serviu na reserva de armamento da unidade militar.

As investigações dão conta de que ele trabalhava como armeiro há pelo menos dez anos.

- É um trabalho que se desenvolveu ao longo dos últimos seis meses. Tanto a inteligência do Exército quanto a polícia trabalharam em conjunto para amadurecer e trazer o maior número de informações possível, culminando com a prisão. Esse trabalho conjunto entre forças armadas e polícias é de suma importância. Cresceu no contexto dos grandes eventos e vem aumentando. Estamos colhendo resultados cada vez mais significativos - disse o coronel Cordeiro, comandante do 1° Batalhão de Polícia do Exército.

Segundo Cordeiro, o caso não envolve a participação de outros integrantes do Exército:

- Cada unidade militar tem as suas características, mas as reservas de armamento sofrem inspeções duas vezes ao dia, e não existe registro nenhum de desvio. Tudo indica que não têm origem de unidade militar tanto esses armamentos quanto as peças. Era um militar que utilizava o conhecimento que tinha para prestar esse tipo de serviço a criminosos. E, a princípio, não há relação com nenhum outro integrante do Exército. É um caso isolado.

Durante a operação, os policiais apreenderam vários fuzis e pistolas, além de ferramentas e peças de armas desmontadas. A ação teve apoio de agentes da Coordenadoria de Recursos Especiais (Core) e da Inteligência do Exército.

SARGENTO FOI 'CONTRATADO' POR ROGÉRIO 157

Na sexta-feira, véspera do início da Guerra na Rocinha, Almeida e seus comparsas montaram uma oficina de armas no interior da favela da Rocinha, na Zona Sul do Rio, com o objetivo de preparar as armas de Rogério 157 que se preparava para a guerra. O sargento contratado diretamente por Rogério 157 e atuaria pela primeira vez em uma comunidade dominada pela facção Amigos dos Amigos (ADA), em virtude da aliança entre o TCP e a ADA denominada TCA.

- Recentemente, ele teve uma aproximação com a facção Amigos dos Amigos, na Rocinha. Às vésperas dos confrontos recentes, chegou a instalar uma oficina no interior da comunidade a mando de Rogério 157. Porém, logo a guerra se iniciou, e ele não chegou a atuar no local. Levou bancada, ferramentas, mas não operou - detalhou o delegado Fabricio Oliveira, titular da Desarme.

1783,1,,"A Colômbia deverá recuperar o tesouro Quimbaya entregue à Coroa espanhola em 1893. A Corte Constitucional do país estudou durante mais de um ano a ação que tinha essa pretensão e na quinta-feira decidiu a favor do denunciante. Com cinco votos contra um, os magistrados do tribunal constitucional reiteraram que o patrimônio cultural não pode ser alienado e por isso as 122 peças de ouro, que permanecem no Museu da América em Madri, devem ser recuperadas e devolvidas à Colômbia.

A decisão da Corte é o desenlace de um processo que começou em 2006, quando o advogado Felipe Rincón levou o assunto à Justiça. O argumento principal para fazê-lo era que o presidente da Colômbia Carlos Holguín presenteou de forma ilegal as peças à rainha María Cristina de Habsburgo-Lorena. Em 2009, um juiz lhe deu razão, mas em 2011 um tribunal revogou a decisão ao considerar que não existia suporte suficiente para declarar que a entrega foi irregular. Agora o Constitucional volta a ficar a favor do demandante e a Colômbia deverá acatar a ordem do máximo tribunal, apesar do Governo, através da Chancelaria, afirmar que a coleção não foi declarada como um bem do patrimônio cultural do país, de modo que, no seu entendimento, não foi entregue de maneira ilegítima.

Patti Londoño Jaramillo, vice-chanceler da Colômbia, afirmou em janeiro do ano passado em uma audiência pública que a entrega das peças foi regulamentada pela lei. “É preciso mencionar que o ato unilateral do chefe de Estado da Colômbia em 1893 constituiu uma manifestação da vontade da República da Colômbia, dentro do marco regulamentar interno vigente, por ser o chefe de Estado o representante natural e legítimo frente aos demais Estados. Foi assim um ato legítimo”, disse a funcionária. Cristina Pardo, do escritório jurídico da Presidência da República, a apoiou e reiterou que a entrega do tesouro cumpriu com o marco legal da época. Mas a outra versão que diz que foi um processo irregular teve mais peso.

A coleção, segundo o advogado Rincón, foi comprada pelo Governo de um guaquero – um caçador de tesouros em sepulturas indígenas – para ser exibido em Madri em 1892. Era esperado que fosse devolvida ao final das comemorações do quarto centenário do descobrimento da América, mas o então presidente Holguín decidiu doá-las em 1893 ao reino da Espanha como agradecimento por um laudo arbitral emitido pela Rainha em uma disputa de limites fronteiriços entre a Colômbia e a Venezuela.

A Procuradoria e a Defensoria do Povo foram favoráveis ao advogado que defendia a devolução do tesouro. Afirmaram que ele é parte da identidade cultural da Colômbia e que, portanto, deve ser recuperado. O espanhol Fernando Vicario, diretor da área de cultura da Organização dos Estados Ibero-americanos, foi outra das vozes ouvidas durante o processo. Nas audiências na Corte afirmou que conseguir com que a coleção Quimbaya retorne ao país pode ser um passo para “consolidar um espaço cultural ibero-americano em um mundo em que os símbolos devem ter mais força do que os assuntos burocráticos e legislativos”.

Após 124 anos, a Colômbia deverá reconhecer que a entrega não foi legítima e iniciar o pedido de devolução das peças através do tratado da Unesco de repatriação de bens culturais. Não o fazer seria, segundo a Corte, uma violação à Constituição, que em três artigos estabelece que não se pode alienar o patrimônio nacional.

Comemorando 25 anos de carreira, Gabriel o Pensador volta às origens com essa nova música (com beat do Papatinho e letra original do Gabriel) inspirada no seu primeiro rap que tocou no rádio de forma totalmente independente e muito ousada na época. Em setembro de 1992, Tô Feliz (matei o presidente) ocupou o primeiro lugar nos pedidos dos ouvintes até ser censurada pelo governo Collor, mas em maio de 1993, a mesma gravação foi incluída entre as dez faixas do primeiro disco do rapper.

Muitos pediram uma nova versão do tema, faz tempo, mas a ideia surgiu quando o atual governo anunciou o decreto que liberava uma área de Reserva enorme da Amazônia para a mineiração.

1798,1,,"ROMA — A cidade italiana de Candela, na Puglia, tem apenas 2.700 moradores, mas tem lugar para 8 mil pessoas. O prefeito Nicola Gatta quer que o município medieval brilhe como nos anos 90 e, para isso, está oferecendo R$ 7,500 para quem deseja se mudar para lá.

— Trabalho todos os dias com paixão e compromisso para trazer o antigo esplendor de Candela de volta — disse Gatta à CNN. — Até os anos 60, os viajantes nos chamavam de Pequena Nápoles, por causa de nossas ruas cheias de pedestres, turistas, mercadores e vendedores.

O labirinto de ruas pitorescas sinuosas, edifícios barrocos e passagens arqueadas corre o risco de se transformar em uma cidade fantasma. A maioria dos jovens fugiu em busca de um futuro em outros lugares, deixando para trás somente os moradores idosos. As diversas igrejas que são vistas em cada rua da cidade realizam poucos batismos e muitos velórios.

A situação fez o prefeito realizar uma cruzada desesperada para salvar a cidade. Dezenas de casas com terraços panorâmicos e varandas ornamentadas estão agora à espera de novas moradores. Para atrair novos habitantes, Gatta abriu os cofres da prefeitura.

— Funciona assim: damos R$ 3 mil para solteiros, R$ 4.500 para casais, até R$ 6.700 para famílias de três pessoas e mais de R$ 7.500 para famílias de quatro ou mais — explicou Stefano Bascianelli à CNN, mão direita do prefeito.

Créditos em impostos sobre lixo, contas e creches também são oferecidos. Porém, há três requisitos para receber o dinheiro: os novos moradores devem morar em Candela, alugar uma casa e ter um emprego com um salário de ao menos R$ 2.300 por mês.

Seis famílias do Norte da Itália já se mudaram para lá e outras cinco já solicitaram a mudança.

1800,1,,"Maior produtor nacional de moluscos, respondendo por 95% da produção brasileira, Santa Catarina interditou os cultivos de ostras, vieiras, mexilhões e berbigões devido à presença de toxina paralisante (PSP). A informação é da Secretaria de Agricultura e Pesca do estado. De acordo com o órgão, está proibida a retirada, comercialização e o consumo destes animais e seus produtos, inclusive nos costões e beiras de praia.

A toxina pode causar diarreia, náuseas, vômitos, dores abdominais, perda de sensibilidade nas extremidades corpo e, em casos severos, paralisia generalizada e óbito por falência respiratória. Os sintomas podem começar aparecer imediatamente ao consumo dos moluscos contaminados. Essas toxinas são estáveis e não são degradadas com o cozimento ou processamento dos moluscos. Todos os moluscos filtradores, independentemente se são ou não cultivados, podem acumular as toxinas.

De acordo com a Epagri, empresa de pesquisa agropecuária de Santa Catarina, o estado é o maior produtor nacional de moluscos, respondendo por 95% da produção brasileira de mexilhões e ostras. Com 589 produtores espalhados ao longo de 12 municípios costeiros, a atividade gera cerca de 1.500 empregos diretos no processo produtivo. Estima-se ainda o envolvimento de mais 5.000 postos de trabalho ao longo de toda a cadeia produtiva, desde a produção de equipamentos e insumos até a distribuição e venda para milhares de consumidores finais. Segundo a Síntese Informativa da Maricultura, divulgada pela Epagri, a produção de moluscos comercializados em 2015 por Santa Catarina foi de 20,4 mil toneladas.

A medida foi necessária após exames laboratoriais detectarem a presença da PSP em cultivos no município de Porto Belo. Como existe a possibilidade de contaminação dos moluscos, a Secretaria da Agricultura interditou todo o litoral catarinense de forma preventiva nesta quinta-feira (19). A secretaria reforça, entretanto, que a presença da toxina na água não representa risco aos banhistas.

A Companhia Integrada de Desenvolvimento Agrícola de Santa Catarina (Cidasc) realizará coletas para monitoramento das áreas de produção. Os resultados dessas análises definirão a liberação ou a manutenção da interdição das áreas afetadas.

Com forte participação em mercados de outros estados, inclusive do Paraná, o problema em Santa Catarina ameaça trazer prejuízos a mercados e restaurantes.

Segundo o representante do Laboratório Laqua-Itajaí/IFSC, Luis Proença, as microalgas que vivem na água compõe a principal fonte primária de alimento dos organismos marinhos. Em condições ambientais favoráveis, o número de células em suspensão na água pode aumentar de forma significativa. Embora a grande maioria de espécies de microalgas seja benéfica, algumas espécies produzem potentes toxinas que podem ser acumuladas por organismos filtradores, como, por exemplo, os moluscos bivalves.

Proença explica que a presença de PSP em moluscos no litoral de Santa Catarina é relativamente rara. A primeira detecção foi em 1997.

Após a parada para fotos, os modelos voltaram ao ponto inicial e distribuiram rosas aos cidadãos, cedidas pela Esal Flores. Para agitar o público e levar mais cultura curitibana ao desfile, as cantoras Michele Mara, Val Andrade e Carine Luup fizeram shows durante todo o evento.

1803,4,,"O ministro do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) Edson Fachin determinou que o ex-diretor geral da Defesa Civil de Salvador Gustavo Ferraz deixe a prisão da Papuda e passe para prisão domiciliar com o uso de tornozeleira eletrônica.

Ferraz foi preso em setembro na operação que descobriu R$ 51 milhões em notas escondidas em caixas e malas num apartamento ligado ao ex-ministro Geddel Vieira Lima (PMDB), que também foi preso. A Polícia Federal encontrou impressões digitais de Ferraz num dos sacos plásticos que envolviam os maços de dinheiro.

Para a soltura de Ferraz, Fachin estabeleceu o pagamento de fiança no valor de cem salários mínimos (que é de R$ 937), a proibição de ocupar funções públicas, utilizar telefone ou internet e de entrar em contato com outros investigados.

A defesa de Ferraz teve outros pedidos de liberdade negados pelo TRF (Tribunal Regional Federal) e pelo STJ (Superior Tribunal de Justiça).

Geddel é investigado pelo suposto recebimento de propina por parte de empresários em troca de facilitação ou liberação de créditos da Caixa Econômica Federal, banco no qual ele foi vice-presidente de Pessoa Jurídica durante parte do primeiro governo da ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff (PT).

Segundo o empresário e delator Lúcio Funaro, Geddel teria recebido ao menos R$ 20 milhões em propinas. Funaro disse que o ex-ministro recebia dinheiro em malas entregues pessoalmente por ele.

O ex-ministro chegou a ser preso uma primeira vez sob suspeita de pressionar a família do corretor de valores Lúcio Funaro para que ele não fechasse um acordo de delação premiada. Geddel responde a processo por essa acusação na Justiça Federal de Brasília.

Na decisão, Fachin também determinou a manutenção da prisão preventiva (sem prazo e antes de condenação) de Geddel.

A reportagem ligou e enviou mensagem de texto ao advogado do ex-ministro, mas não obteve resposta.

O advogado de Ferraz, Pedro Machado de Almeida Castro, afirmou que a inocência de seu cliente será comprovada e que ele está à disposição da Justiça para esclarecimentos.

""A decisão do ministro Fachin é o primeiro passo para a comprovação de inocência de Gustavo Ferraz"", disse. ""Além disso, [Ferraz] está à disposição da Justiça e autoridades para esclarecimentos, não oferecendo risco ao processo ou à sociedade, e está tranquilo quanto à sua inocência sobre os fatos investigados"", afirmou Castro.

1804,1,,"O prefeito Jo�o Doria (PSDB) desistiu de incluir na merenda das escolas da rede municipal de S�o Paulo a farinata, um produto desenvolvido com alimentos perto da data de validade e que seriam descartados. O recuo ocorre ap�s mal estar com a Secretaria de Educa��o, que n�o foi consultada antes do an�ncio de Doria.

Nota divulgada pela assessoria de imprensa da prefeitura indica que o foco da pol�tica ser� na �rea de assist�ncia social. ""A eventual distribui��o do composto alimentar do programa denominado Allimento para Todos, no formato de farinata, ser� de atribui��o, principalmente, dos servi�os municipais de assist�ncia social"", afirma a nota.

A Secretaria de Educa��o, por meio da Codae, � a respons�vel pela escolha dos alimentos da merenda, bem como pelo desenho do card�pio. A legisla��o do PNAE (Programa Nacional de Alimenta��o Escolar) estipula ainda que qualquer introdu��o de novo alimento (com exce��o de frutas e hortali�as) deve passar por teste de aceitabilidade pelos alunos, coordenado por nutricionista. Por meio desse programa federal, a prefeitura paulistana recebe recursos para a merenda.

5. Essa farinha pode ser usada na merenda s� com aval de Doria?

N�o. A Codae (Coordenadoria de Alimenta��o Escolar), da Secretaria Municipal de Educa��o, � respons�vel pelo planejamento, execu��o e o controle das atividades relativas ao abastecimento de g�neros aliment�cios, assim como pela defini��o dos card�pios oferecidos na merenda. Resolu��o federal no �mbito do PNAE (Programa Nacional de Alimenta��o Escolar) ainda estipula que a introdu��o de novos alimentos na merenda, com exce��o de frutas e hortali�as, seja precedida por teste de aceitabilidade por parte dos alunos. O teste � realizado pela Codae, que analisa a pertin�ncia dos alimentos com rela��o ao balanceamento nutricional.

7. Por que Doria apresentou o granulado se ele n�o faz parte do projeto?

A Plataforma Sinergia, organiza��o sem fins lucrativos que fabrica o granulado, estava no evento e entregou uma amostra a Doria. Sem saber detalhes do produto, o prefeito fez um v�deo o promovendo.

10. Qual � a rela��o desses produtos com a Igreja Cat�lica?

A Arquidiocese de S�o Paulo apoia o uso da farinata no combate � fome desde 2013, quando dom Odilo Scherer a recomendou ao Papa Francisco por meio de carta. Nesta quarta-feira (18), o arcebispo disse que fica ""ofendido"" ao ouvir compara��es da farinata a ra��o. ""N�o politizem a fome do pobre. Desprezar o pobre � n�o dar alimento a ele"", disse.

1805,1,,"BRUXELAS - Líderes da União Europeia ofereceram seu apoio ao primeiro-ministro espanhol, Mariano Rajoy, na crise com a Catalunha, durante uma cúpula realizada nesta quinta-feira, 19, em Bruxelas. Rajoy convocou uma reunião com ministros para decidir se vai suspender a autonomia da província, como mais uma tentativa de evitar a declaração definitiva de independência da região.

A chanceler da Alemanha, Angela Merkel, disse que espera uma saída com base na Constituição espanhola. ""É claro que isso nos preocupa. Nós estamos observando isso muito de perto e apoiamos a posição do governo espanhol, que é também adotada por vários partidos.""

Na mesma linha, o presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, declarou que ""sempre apoiará o governo espanhol"", acrescentando que ""esta reunião enviaria por uma mensagem de unidade dos países da União Europeia em relação à Espanha"".

Outros líderes do bloco também manifestaram apoio. O primeiro-ministro de Luxemburgo, Xavier Bettel, disse acreditar que o embate entre os governos central de Madri e regional de Barcelona precisa de uma uma solução diplomática e política. ""Existe uma lei e a lei deve ser respeitada"", afirmou.

O premiê holandês, Mark Rutte, desconversou, dizendo que esse não é um problema para ser discutido pela União Europeia, pois se trata de uma ""questão interna espanhola"".

Já o primeiro-ministro belga, Charles Michel, que tem movimentos separatistas em seu próprio país para enfrentar, foi o mais conciliador com os catalães. Ele condenou a violência e pediu diálogo entre os dois governos.

+ Como ficam os clubes de futebol espanhóis em caso de independência da Catalunha

A União Europeia já havia manifestado que não reconhecerá a independência da Catalunha. Caso a província consiga se separar da Espanha, automaticamente não estaria mais no bloco, segundo representantes.

A Espanha emitiu uma declaração na quinta-feira de manhã, invocando o artigo 155 da Constituição ""para restaurar a legalidade"" do governo autônomo, depois que o governador da Catalunha, Carles Puigdemont, escreveu uma carta ameaçando que confirmaria a secessão caso Madri não voltasse atrás na prisão de líderes do movimento independentista.

Puigdemont cita na carta o plebiscito do dia 1º como dando legitimidade à causa separatista, embora tenha sido conduzida em violação da Constituição espanhola, segundo Madri. Rajoy, que rejeitou os apelos de Puigdemont para o diálogo até que ele volte a atuar dentro da lei, não quis dar entrevistas ao chegar para o encontro em Bruxelas. / REUTERS

1827,4,,"O bagulho agora vai ficar frenético, como diz a bandidagem. O presidente Michel Temer acaba de sancionar o projeto de lei aprovado pelo Congresso Nacional que livra os militares envolvidos em conflitos com civis de serem processados na Justiça comum. O projeto de lei que teve o aval de Temer transfere para a Justiça Militar os casos de crimes dolosos contra a vida de civis praticados por militares no exercício de missões como as realizadas nos morros cariocas.

Caso um membro das Forças Armadas entre em confronto com criminosos durante as operações de segurança, ele não será mais julgado pela Justiça, onde os embaraços são maiores. Nestes casos, Militar em atividade de guerra nos morros e favelas do Rio responderá por suas ações apenas na Justiça Militar, que tem uma abordagem própria para estes casos.

Pelo texto publicado na edição nesta segunda do Diário Oficial da União, passam a ser julgados na Justiça Militar casos em que os militares matem criminosos durante operações de Garantia da Lei e da Ordem (GLO), de operações de paz, no cumprimento de atribuições estabelecidas pelo presidente da República ou pelo ministro da Defesa, em ações que envolvam a segurança de instituição militar ou em missão de paz.

“O emprego recorrente das Forças Armadas como último recurso estatal em ações de segurança pública justifica a existência de uma norma permanente a regular a questão”, registra o texto.

Ao ser aprovado no Congresso, o projeto gerou reações de apoio de militares e críticas da turma dos direitos humanos através de suas organizações da sociedade civil e do Ministério Público Federal. A Anistia Internacional divulgou nota afirmando que o projeto iguala a legislação às normas do regime militar e prejudica a realização de julgamentos imparciais. Isso por que nenhum destes ativistas ricos vivem em regiões de conflitos, violência e tráfico de drogas.

O Superior Tribunal Militar declarou que para exercer as atribuições com maior segurança, os militares devem ter a garantia de que serão julgados por juízes isentos, especialistas, que entendem e conhecem as nuances deste tipo de operação.

1828,4,,"O procurador Ângelo Goulart Villela expôs a trama criminosa do ex-procurador-geral da República Rodrigo Janot nesta quarta-feira, 17, durante seu depoimento a parlamentares na CPMI da JBS. Testemunha ocular dos fatos que levaram o país à beira do precipício institucional dos últimos meses, Janot, ao lado dos criminosos da JBS e patrocinado por gangues de cínicos da imprensa, causou bilhões em prejuízos a milhões de brasileiros com sua ganância por poder.

O procurador acusou Janot formalmente de atuar politicamente ao assinar o acordo de delação premiada com executivos do grupo J&F. Villela presta depoimento a parlamentares na CPMI da JBS.

""Não há a menor chance de o Rodrigo Janot não ter autuado de forma política, sem entrar no mérito da procedência da denúncia, para impedir que o presidente da República deixasse de indicar a dra. Raquel Dodge. E para isso ele precisava derrubar o presidente"", disse Villela. ""Ele (Janot) sempre diz que tinha um crime em andamento, por isso tinha que dar a imunidade. Mentira. A pressa tinha outro motivo.""

Isso, para mim, é claro, cristalino, evidente.”

Para o procurador, é mentira que Janot acelerou a delação da JBS para parar “um crime em andamento”. Janot usou a instituição PGR para cometer crimes contra a nação e contra os brasileiros. E repetiu a dose de crimes ao premiar outro criminoso para causar ainda mais danos ao país e impedir a recuperação da economia.

""A questão do Rodrigo Janot, na minha opinião, deputado, era mais do que uma proteção ao Marcelo Miller. A minha questão em relação a ele é que ele precisava deixar bem claro nesse ambiente que a gente vive, midiático, de combate da corrupção, de queridinho da mídia, de super-herói, era deixar claro que ele atuava de forma imparcial, que o compromisso dele seria única e exclusivamente combater a corrupção, doa a quem doer"", disse o procurador, denunciando a atuação da mídia na conspiração engendrada na PGR por Janot, Joesley Batista e Marcelo MIller.

Mas a maldada de Janot não teria prosperado sem a ajuda de jornalistas covardes e inescrupulosos à serviço de especuladores do mercado financeiro e de grupos de comunicação ávidos para obter novamente acesso ao dinheiro do contribuinte.

Em editorial, o jornal O Estado de S. Paulo denuncia os interesses espúrios por trás das manobras do ex-procurador da República para destruir a economia do país em nome de interesses de outras organizações criminosas:

“Não há dúvida de que a revelação das gravações de Lúcio Funaro, nas circunstâncias em que ocorreu, causa sério dano ao País. Ela alimenta artificialmente uma turbulência política que atrasa a retomada do crescimento econômico e dificulta a melhora das condições sociais da população, especialmente de quem está socialmente mais vulnerável. Ao mesmo tempo, a difusão de acusações que ainda não foram comprovadas não contribui para o esclarecimento de crimes eventualmente cometidos. Não se combate a corrupção com esse tipo de vazamento, que alimenta a produção de novos escândalos, com seus pérfidos efeitos sobre o País e a população (…).

No caso concreto, há ainda um problema adicional, já que a divulgação dos vídeos foi ocasião para a difusão de muitas notícias falsas, dando a entender que o conteúdo incriminaria o presidente da República, quando na verdade o próprio delator Lúcio Funaro diz, nos vídeos, que ele nunca entregou dinheiro a Michel Temer.”

1831,4,,"O Superchance foi um dos quadros de maior sucesso do programa Caldeirão do Huck, atração das tardes de sábado da Rede Globo sob o comando do apresentados Luciano Huck. Para selecionar os candidatos, a página do programa anunciava que buscava pessoas ""com garra e força de vontade para vencer um desafio de precisão e ganhar um prêmio em dinheiro de até R$ 30 mil!"".

A emissora só não informava que para participar do programa, o candidato teria que permitir que a produção do espetáculo fizesse pequenos resumos de sua vida pessoal, com direito a gravar cenas em sua casa, entrevistar sua esposa, filhos, mãe, pais e etc. Obviamente, a produção do programa selecionava pessoas em dificuldades financeiras e produzia uma mini novela descrevendo a situação de miséria dos candidatos. Muitos choravam durante os depoimentos, relatando casos de dívidas, doenças e até mesmo necessidade básicas, como alimentos.

Na prática, a Globo exigia um relato da condição de miséria do candidato, expondo sua vida de forma humilhante perante toda uma nação em troca da chance remota de levar para casa míseros R$ 30 mil. Enquanto isso,  as anunciantes pagavam até R$ 600 mil por 15 segundos de propaganda e outros milhões em merchandising para Luciano Huck vender seus produtos durante o programa.

Na maioria dos casos, o participante era instado a apostar tudo que havia ganho até determinado ponto do programa em uma última jogada suicida. Caso acertasse o gol, levaria para casa os R$ 30 mil. Caso errasse, perderia os R$ 20 mil já garantidos, levando apenas um prêmio de consolação de mil reais. O clima de suspense era explorado ao limite, enquanto Luciano Huck lembrava o participante que aquele dinheiro poderia ajudá-lo a sair da situação delicada em que se encontrava, até que a atração principal do programa, o pobre que tinha toda sua miséria explorada de modo sensacionalista, caia na tentação. Mas antes da jogada final, mais comerciais, mais merchandising, mais milhões no caixa da Globo e nos bolsos de Luciano Huck.

O curioso nestes tristes espetáculos de 'compaixão' é que os telespectadores são induzidos a acreditar que Luciano Huck é um cara gente boa que ajuda os mais necessitados. Por sinal, a falsa compaixão é um dos principais instrumentos utilizados pelo ex-presidente Lula e pelos representantes da política nacional em seus discursos hipócritas.

Recorrer à compaixão para parecer bonzinho é uma fórmula infalível. A compaixão é um sentimento que não exige que o indivíduo ocupe no lugar de um miserável ou que se sujeite às mesmas privações. Basta apenas que o indivíduo demonstre ter consciência de que as pessoas enfrentam dificuldades. Assim como Lula, Luciano Huck tem bastante compaixão pelas pessoas necessitadas, mas tem verdadeira obsessão por dinheiro e poder. Assim como Lula, Luciano Huck usa as pessoas necessitadas para exibir toda sua compaixão, mas em seus momentos de lazer, prefere se reunir com gente como Eike Batista, Sérgio Cabral e Joesley Batista. Luciano Huck ama ostentação e se exibe orgulhoso em sua ilha, no helicóptero que comprou para seu filho quando ele tinha dois anos, etc.

É este mesmo Luciano Huck que agora anuncia suas pretensões de ingressar na política. O apresentador da Rede Globo, a mesma que tolerou os 13 anos de corrupção do PT e apostou todas suas fichas para derrubar o presidente Michel Temer, disse nesta quarta-feira 18 que “quer e vai participar” do processo de renovação política do Brasil e deixou no ar a possibilidade de se candidatar a algum cargo nas eleições do ano que vem.

A declaração está em um artigo do apresentador publicado na edição desta quarta-feira do jornal Folha de S. Paulo.

“Como já me comprometi publicamente antes, quero e vou participar deste processo de renovação política no Brasil”, diz o texto. “Reafirmo que continuo achando que, de onde estou, fora do dia a dia da política, minha contribuição pode ser mais efetiva e relevante”.

No texto, Huck afirma que o Brasil foi arrastado para uma “crise econômica e caos social sem precedentes” e disse que os brasileiros precisam aproveitar melhor esse “assustador vácuo de liderança”. “Sinto que ela pode ser uma das maiores oportunidades para abrir um novo ciclo na história da República, ressignificar nossas instituições e, principalmente, reorientar os valores e princípios daqueles que querem servir”, escreveu o apresentador.

“Para fazer do Brasil um país mais justo, entendo que o melhor caminho será “ocupar”, por meio do voto, o Legislativo brasileiro com cérebros, sinapses, ideias e ideais de primeira qualidade”, escreveu o apresentador.

“Assim, quero e vou apoiar movimentos cívicos de curadoria e fomento. Movimentos que incentivem a participação política do cidadão comum, que contribuam para a elaboração de propostas que deem um novo rumo ao país”, afirmou o apresentador, que se associou a empresários bilionários para financiar a eleição de pelo menos 100 deputados federais nas próximas eleições. Em outras palavras, Luciano Huck se associou as elites brasileiras para comprar a Democracia e garantir sua ascensão ao poder.

Luciano Huck se sente bem no papel de aposta da Globo e das elites para catalizar os votos dos ignorantes órfãos de Lula nas eleições de 2018. De fato, o sujeito é digno mesmo deste papel.

1833,4,,"Se você é como a maioria absoluta dos brasileiros, ficou do lado de Dona Regina em sua indignação contra o ato de forçar crianças a tocar corpos nus de homens sob pretexto de que “é arte”.

Ao chegarmos para qualquer pessoa normal e contarmos o que aconteceu no MAM, a reação natural é de indignação.

Em razão dessa indignação, a maior parte do povo aderiu à campanha contra a elite de artistas milionários da Rede Globo, que se venderam à agenda de extrema esquerda.

Pois não é que agora esses monstros – que aliam ao que há de pior na história da humanidade – estão dizendo que aqueles que estão indignados com a erotização infantil em exposições o fazem apenas para “esconder casos de corrupção”?

É de um sadismo sem igual dizer que todos aqueles cidadãos (como Dona Regina) não possuem sentimentos reais, sendo apenas dissimulação para esconder escândalos de corrupção.

Já sabíamos da capacidade da extrema esquerda de odiar o povo comum, mas agora eles se superam com essa narrativa.

Vale lembrar que a própria extrema esquerda não acredita em suas próprias palavras, uma vez que tudo que eles menos querem é que o povo fale mais sobre os escândalos de corrupção. Fazendo isso, exigirão a prisão imediata de Lula, principalmente após o escândalo dos recibos de aluguel.

Quer dizer. A extrema esquerda, além de mentir sobre os interesses do povo – fingindo que as pessoas apenas se indignam com pedofilia e erotização de crianças para “esconder corrupção” – também não está nem um pouco mais interessada no aumento de punição para os corruptos, uma vez que isso demandaria a prisão imediata de Lula.

De qualquer forma, o que está claro é que a extrema esquerda mostra de novo seu ódio ao povo comum ao mentir sobre as intenções de brasileiros sofridos que se preocupam com as crianças.

Quando os brasileiros dizem “deixem nossas crianças em paz”, geralmente manifestam sentimentos reais que precisam ser respeitados. Já a extrema esquerda não possui nenhum sentimento nobre, e portanto julga o povo humilde do Brasil por sua régua podre.

1834,4,,"Relembrando matéria de 2 de dezembro de 2012, publicada no site ConJur, com o título “Indicação de Fux ao Supremo é cobrada por PT”.

O ministro Luiz Fux, 59, diz que desde 1983, quando, aprovado em concurso, foi juiz de Niterói (RJ), passou a sonhar com o dia em que se sentaria em uma das onze cadeiras do Supremo Tribunal Federal. Entrevista assinada por Mônica Bergamo, na edição deste domingo (2/12) da Folha de S. Paulo,mostra que, para chegar lá, Fux contou com apoio de José Dirceu e outros petistas, que agora cobram uma postura mais benevolente do ministro.

Quase trinta anos depois, de sua aprovação, em 2010, ele saía em campanha pelo Brasil para convencer o então presidente Lula a indicá-lo à corte.

Fux era ministro do Superior Tribunal de Justiça, o penúltimo degrau na carreira da magistratura. “Estava nessa luta” para o STF desde 2004 — sempre que surgia uma vaga, ele se colocava. E acabava preterido. “Bati na trave três vezes”, diz.

Aqui é o trecho mais revelador:

Naquele último ano de governo Lula, era tudo ou nada.

Fux “grudou” em Delfim Netto. Pediu carta de apoio a João Pedro Stedile, do MST. Contou com a ajuda de Antônio Palocci. Pediu uma força ao governador do Rio, Sergio Cabral. Buscou empresários.

E se reuniu com José Dirceu, o mais célebre réu do mensalão. “Eu fui a várias pessoas de SP, à Fiesp. Numa dessas idas, alguém me levou ao Zé Dirceu porque ele era influente no governo Lula.”

O ministro diz não se lembrar quem era o “alguém” que o apresentou ao petista.

Fux diz que, na época, não achou incompatível levar currículo ao réu de processo que ele poderia no futuro julgar. Apesar da superexposição de Dirceu na mídia, afirma que nem se lembrou de sua condição de “mensaleiro”.

“Eu confesso a você que naquele momento eu não me lembrei”, diz o magistrado. “Porque a pessoa, até ser julgada, ela é inocente.”

Conversaram uma só vez, e por 15 minutos, segundo Fux. Conversaram mais de uma vez, segundo Dirceu.

A equipe do petista, em resposta a questionamento da Folha, afirmou por e-mail: “A assessoria de José Dirceu confirma que o ex-ministro participou de encontros com Luiz Fux, sempre a pedido do então ministro do STJ”.

E tem mais:

Para Dirceu, também era a hora do tudo ou nada.

Ele aguardava o julgamento do mensalão. O ministro a ser indicado para o STF, nos estertores do governo Lula, poderia ser o voto chave da tão sonhada absolvição.

E agora, como é que fica?

O Brasil vai assistir a Fux dando liminar ao terrorista Battisti – que matou quatro pessoas e deixou um jovem paraplégico – impunemente? Nada vai acontecer?

1835,4,,"Uma matéria recente do Extra mostra que no Rio de Janeiro cada vez mais os artistas milionários andam de carros blindados. De acordo com Elana Viana, diretora da Blindaquo, que está há 11 anos no mercado, está faltando frota para atender tantos pedidos.

“Durante o Rock in Rio, por exemplo, ficamos sem veículo para locação tamanha demanda”, conta ela.

Entre os clientes de blindagem para carros estão Simone e Simaria, Carolina Dieckmann, a ex-BBB Adriana Sant’Anna, Preta Gil, Pabllo Vittar, o jogador Leo Moura e o humorista Ceará.

“De cada dez cotações, duas são para blindados contra fuzil”, conta Elana, que já está pensando em formar uma frota com esse tipo de proteção: “Só carros muito potentes podem ter uma blindagem dessa, que pesa muito um carro normal”.

O mais curioso é que é exatamente essa elite artística que adora fazer campanha pelo desarmamento, mesmo andando com seguranças armados.

Igualmente glorificam os criminosos, mas apenas por andarem de carros blindados.

Essa é mais uma prova de que eles não seguem o que pregam. A violência para esses artistas milionários é uma diversão enquanto atinge principalmente o povo humilde, mas raramente os próprios artistas.

Não há nada de errado em andar de carro blindado. O duro é quando você pertence a uma categoria de pessoas – os artistas milionários de extrema esquerda – que defendem leis de leniência perante o crime e impõem desarmamento ao povo.

Sendo assim, que credibilidade teria um torcedor do PT entrevistando eu, um artista que está literalmente na lista negra do PT?

2) Que tipo de jornalista cultural vai conversar sobre um filme de ficção/comédia e não faz uma pergunta sequer sobre direção, roteiro, fotografia, atuação e outros aspectos artísticos e cinematográficos?

3) Porque o mesmo cara que estava uma semana atrás defendendo a liberdade para todos artistas e que pedofilia é uma coisa e arte é outra, agora teve um surto moral e se mostra inconformado com uma obra artística de ficção, roteirizada, onde nada daquilo aconteceu na vida real? Chego até mesmo a pensar que na verdade ele estaria escandalizado porque retratamos o pedófilo como um vilão, sem relativizar a pedofilia. Seriam os pedófilos uma nova minoria a ser protegida das piadas?

4) Ao perguntar em tom de desaprovação se “pode fazer piada com pedófilo e psicopata” o cara que recebe um salário como “especialista de cinema” (uii) demonstra desconhecer momentos clássicos da sétima arte como o hilário piloto de “Apertem os cintos o piloto sumiu” ou o mais recente “Quero matar meu chefe”.

Porém, Bolsonaro descobriu a armadilha antecipadamente, pois Langevin havia convocado um ato de milicianos de extrema esquerda para atacar o candidato.

Veja um vídeo mostrando Langevin apoiando Dilma e Jean Wyllys antes de “convidar” Bolsonaro para a palestra.

Mesmo assim, o militante petista disse, na sexta, à BBC: “Bolsonaro mostrou que não está pronto para um debate democrático, aberto ao público, e a um público misturado, formado por simpatizantes, mas também críticos e curiosos.”

Mas na verdade qualquer um sabe que os atos promovidos pelas milícias de extrema esquerda nos EUA são mais violentos do que aqueles promovidos pelo Brasil. Eles não apenas destroem as universidades, como batem principalmente em mulheres e idosos. As vezes batem até em cadeirantes.

Nos EUA, as milícias de extrema esquerda priorizam a adoção do rótulo “antifa” (embora atuem de maneira fascista), o qual serve como propaganda para legitimação da violência.

Erradamente, a direita os rotula de “antifa”, quando deveria chamá-los de terroristas da extrema esquerda, alt-left ou algo do tipo.

A esposa de Roger, Elisabeth, diz: “Hoje a gente não pode ter opinião, é criticado por qualquer coisa, não pode ter liberdade. A gente respeita a opinião das pessoas, mas as pessoas não nos respeitam. As pessoas acham que têm direito de fazer isso”.

Enquanto o jogador segue se recuperando da cirurgia da retirada do tumor renal e tem a expectativa de voltar aos treinamentos em um mês, teve jornalista que chegou a fazer piada com a doença e até a atacar a filha do jogador, que é deficiente visual.

Não convidem, neste momento, Anitta e Pabllo Vittar para o mesmo fervo. A Poderosa anda na bronca com a drag queen, que cobrou um alto cachê para se apresentar na segunda edição da festa Combatchy, no dia 19 de novembro, em São Paulo.

Ingratidão? Foi Anitta quem bancou toda a participação da Pabllo no clipe da música “Sua cara”, gravado no Marrocos. O clipe fez com que a drag queen se tornasse conhecida até o estouro definitivo no Rock in Rio, quando chegou a dividir o palco com Fergie. De lá para cá, Pabllo viu seu cachê aumentar de R$ 40 mil para R$ 80 mil.

Na primeira edição da festa idealizada por Anitta, no Rio, quando foi exibido pela primeira vez o clipe “Sua cara”, Pabllo Vittar ainda não era tão conhecida e participou do evento. Claudia Leitte agora será a convidada da segunda edição.

De novo, sempre é bom repetir que o socialismo é isso mesmo: grana no bolso a partir dos bobos que caem na conversa.

1845,4,,"Gentili já sofreu censura de todo tipo, seja por causa de comentários em entrevistas ou de piadas de “mau gosto”. Ele é, na atualidade, uma das figuras no país que mais sofreu processos por danos morais, em alguns casos sendo obrigado a indenizar pessoas a quem não fez mal algum só porque ousou pisar no calo de gente poderosa.

Já tentaram calá-lo diversas vezes, já o intimidaram e até ameaçaram, e mesmo assim ele se manteve firme e forte, continuou na TV, ainda que tenha trocado de emissora, e seu programa atual no SBT é um dos maiores sucessos de audiência no país,m ganhando muitas vezes da Rede Globo.

The Noite já chegou a bater a audiência do Programa do Jô, hoje extinto, e tem diversas vezes destroçado seus concorrentes como o atual Conversa com Bial, Programa do Porchat e outros. É nítido que ele tem amplo apoio popular e carisma, do contrário isso não funcionaria como não funcionou com Rafinha Bastos.

Toda essa perseguição, então, só pode vir de um lugar: a extrema-esquerda. Radicais comunistas não toleram a divergência, e se alguém ousa confrontá-los, ainda que esteja apenas fazendo piadas, vira um inimigo mortal de todos eles. É por isso que Gentili sofre esse tipo de perseguição, algo que nem Rafinha Bastos e nem Fábio Porchat chegaram perto de sofrer. Certamente isso tem a ver com o fato de que tais figuras levantaram publicamente a bandeira do “impeachment é golpe”, enquanto Gentili teve a decência de continuar defendendo aquilo que acredita e exercendo sua liberdade de expressão.

De todo modo, isso prova que grupos como o #342 – Artes não estão nem aí para lutar contra a censura. Pelo contrário, eles defendem a censura de quem criticou as exposições pedófilas do MAM e do Santander Cultural. Defendem também a censura contra quem quer lançar biografias não autorizadas, como Paula Lavigne passou mais de uma década fazendo.

É claro que também defendem a censura contra Danilo Gentili. Se não defendessem a censura estariam agora mesmo lutando contra ela em casos nos quais ela realmente ocorreu.

Culpar Danilo Gentili pela demissão do repórter petista é mau caratismo. Diego Bargas é responsável pelo que faz…

Culpar Danilo Gentilli pela demissão do repórter é mau caratismo. O repórter pode fazer a matéria como quiser e o entrevistado tem o direito de falar sobre isso. Acabou o tempo em que os jornais não eram cobrados pelo que escrevem.

O que realmente incomoda os preocupados com a “intolerância” é o fato de verem suas mentiras confrontadas. Danilo Gentilli não “pediu a cabeça” do jornalista ( como Lula fez com Sinara Policarpo). O que ele fez foi contestar e desmentir o repórter, além de postar a entrevista NA ÍNTEGRA para que você possa tirar suas conclusões, algo que o repórter devia ter feito.

Com as redes sociais, a imprensa é questionada como nunca fora antes e reage a isso produzindo notícias falsas e perdendo cada vez mais a confiança do público. Talvez seja hora de quem sabe, a imprensa entender que seu papel é mostrar o que o povo pensa e não tentar impor suas crenças. Só assim, um jornalista vai ter a decência não tentar enquadrar recortes da realidade em uma narrativa própria e assumir a própria responsabilidade frente a consequência de seus atos.

Essa outra mensagem encontrada no Facebook – e não tenho o nome do autor aqui – também vale a pena ser lida:

Vou resumir a treta entre Danilo Gentili e o repórter demitido da Folha:

– O jornalista era militante do PT. Sim, isso é um fato, apesar dele achar absurdo alguém afirmar que ele defende o PT só porque acharam 5 posts em seu Facebook… defendendo o PT! Há várias formas de militar, e fazer isso por redes sociais é uma delas. Mas nenhuma novidade até aí. O DataChammas afirma que 98,5% das redações de jornais são compostas por pessoas de esquerda, e boa parte dos meus colegas – infelizmente – ainda apóia o PT.

– O repórter foi pra entrevista já com a matéria escrita na cabeça, só em busca de uma aspa de Danilo para encaixar no texto e ilustrar sua tese. Prova disso é que direcionou todas as perguntas para o mesmo tema e, segundo o humorista, fez questão de dizer que não gostou do filme, após a entrevista. Mais uma vez, nenhuma novidade. Todo jornalista já fez isso alguma vez na vida. Até eu. E isso não chega a ser antiético. Se a matéria é sobre o filme, e o cara já viu o filme, a entrevista seria mesmo só um complemento.

– O repórter não gostava do entrevistado. Se o cara é jornalista, petista e politicamente correto, a chance dele gostar de Danilo era abaixo de zero. E, mais uma vez, não há nada de extraordinário nisso. Muitas vezes jornalistas entrevistam pessoas de quem não gostam. E é muito mais gostoso fazer perguntas constrangedoras para quem você não gosta. Mas ele se deu mal, porque Danilo passou a maior parte da entrevista calado, e quem falou mais foi o outro rapaz (diretor do filme, eu acho). Jogada de mestre: nenhuma pergunta ficaria sem resposta, ao mesmo tempo em que o cara não ia conseguir arrancar nenhuma fala comprometedora de Gentili.

– E ele não conseguiu mesmo, mas isso não foi suficiente para desistir de escrever um texto militante lacrador, dizendo que o filme era opressor, pedófilo (ainda não assisti, mas pela defesa de Danilo, trata-se de um crime cometido pelo vilão do filme, como poderia ser um assassinato, um sequestro, um assalto… e não algo defendido como se fosse arte) e que o humorista teria se recusado a responder sobre o assunto (o que é mentira, como pode ser visto no vídeo). Bom… matérias com mimimi esquerdista e deturpações de entrevistas para comprovar uma tese também não chegam a representar uma grande revolução contemporânea. Sempre existiram e não deixarão de existir tão cedo.

Mas então… o que tornou esse fato tão escandaloso, causando até a demissão do repórter-militante? Simples… a Folha de S. Paulo tem pouco mais de 7 milhões de seguidores. Danilo Gentili tem quase o dobro: 13 milhões. Quando a Folha atacou, Danilo se defendeu contra-atacando (normal), e seus seguidores resolveram ajudar. A coisa tomou uma proporção enorme e todos os olhares se voltaram para a tal matéria. Não sei se teve mais algum fato (o jornalista diz que não pode entrar em detalhes), mas parece que a Folha quis se redimir com essa parcela gigantesca do público e demitiu o cara (se foi a atitude mais acertada, é assunto para outro post).

O fato é que com 13 milhões de seguidores e um programa líder de audiência na TV (conseguido, grande parte, graças ao seu sucesso nas redes sociais), Danilo não precisa dos elogios da Folha de S. Paulo pra promover seu filme. Ao contrário, garanto que a confusão ajudou bem mais na divulgação do que uma crítica positiva e despolitizada ajudaria.

Danilo Gentili não precisou de um grande jornal ou sequer de seu programa de TV para protestar contra o artigo e se defender. São as redes sociais dando voz a quem antes teria que entrar na Justiça para – quem sabe – conseguir um direito de resposta no mesmo jornal. Ele não precisa disso. Ele é maior que a Folha. Tempos sombrios para quem estava acostumado a falar sem ser confrontado, não é mesmo?

A verdade é que a cobrança sobre a mídia aumentou. A cada dia que passa, jornais como a Folha ficam mais desacreditados.

Diego Bargas foi afobado demais em sua sanha de mentir. Escreveu achando que estava no Brasil247, onde nem sequer existe a dissimulação das mentiras. Mas na Folha ainda existe um pouco de dissimulação.

Se nem isso ele conseguiu fazer, o resultado está aí: sua demissão. A culpa pertence apenas ao jornalista e não a Danilo Gentili.

1847,4,,"O NY Times, jornal esquerdista (que chegou a declarar apoio editorial a Hillary) disse na última sexta (13) que seus jornalistas devem evitar falar sobre alguns assuntos nas redes sociais. As informações são do ILISP.

De acordo com o documento, os jornalistas do NYT “não devem expressar opiniões partidárias, promover visões políticas, apoiar candidatos, fazer comentários ofensivos ou dizer algo que prejudique a reputação jornalista do Times em posts nas redes sociais (…) na medida em que a percepção de nossos jornalistas como tendenciosos pode reduzir a credibilidade de toda a redação“.

O jornal adverte que “tudo que postamos ou curtimos é público e provavelmente será associado ao Times” e determina que as diretrizes “devem ser seguidas por todos os departamentos da redação, incluindo aqueles que não façam cobertura política”.

O documento também pede que os jornalistas não podem antecipar nas redes o conteúdo exclusivo do NYT , não reclamar sobre produtos ou serviços, evitar participar de grupos privados ou secretos nas redes sociais que tenham visões partidárias e não se registrarem em eventos partidários nas redes sociais.

Sobre as críticas, a nota diz que “se as críticas forem agressivas ou maldosas, provavelmente é melhor não responder”. Ao fim, pede que os jornalistas evitem silenciar ou bloquear pessoas que estejam apenas efetuando críticas às matérias.

No fundo, eles sabem que seus jornalistas esquerdistas sempre estarão difamando alguém no momento de falar de política. Talvez estejam apenas se precavendo de tomar processos ao implementar tal medida.

1848,4,,"O texto de Diego Bargas – que gerou sua demissão – é “Comédia juvenil rid e bullying e pedofilia”. É um texto de militância política travestido de crítica cinematográfica.

A crítica começa assim: “O filme “Como se Tornar o Pior Aluno da Escola”, que estreou nos cinemas do país nesta quinta-feira (12), espicha a discussão incessante sobre os limites do humor.”.

Durante exibição para jornalistas, gerou comentários a cena em que com os garotos e um personagem interpretado pelo comediante e apresentador Fábio Porchat. Ainda no início do filme, o homem propõe ajudá-los a encontrar o tal pior aluno desde que o masturbem.

Procurado, Porchat disse à Folha que “a cena é escrota mesmo, e foi escrita para ser. Acho até que tem outras piores.”

Com classificação etária de 14 anos, um dos atores na cena, Bruno Monhoz, sequer poderá ver o filme –ele tem 13. Seu parceiro de cena, Daniel Pimentel, está com 18.

Questionado sobre as piadas com pedofilia, Gentili preferiu não responder.

Quer dizer que havia “pedofillia” no filme de Gentili?

Bem, o tal de Diego Bargas não conseguiu demonstrar.

Mas ao fazer isso ele quebrou a narrativa do 342 Artes, pois mostrou que alusões sobre pedofilia podem ser objeto de crítica. Mas é justamente isso que a elite artística queria proibir: a menção è erotização infantil, pois “é tudo arte”.

O fato é que não há pedofilia alguma no filme de Gentili, mas no caso da exposição no MAM uma criança de fato foi forçada a tocar em um homem nu.

Como é que uma mídia que dizia até ontem que ninguém podia falar nada do fato de uma criança tocando em homem nu – pois “é tudo arte”, diziam – agora quer reclamar de uma inexistente pedofilia no filme de Gentili?

Ou seja, Diego Bargas quebrou a narrativa. Talvez esse tenha sido o motivo de sua demissão.

Agora qualquer um pode dizer: “enquanto o 342 Artes diz que ninguém pode apontar pedofilia no MAM, pois seria ‘arte’, tem jornalista da Folha que acusava o filme de Danilo Gentili de ter pedofilia”.

Mais a partir da matéria: “Este número faz parte de um levantamento do Paraná Pesquisas, realizado entre 10 e 16 de outubro, com 2.365 pessoas, a pedido da Gazeta do Povo.

A matéria ainda diz: “Entre os pesquisados, a maior taxa de rejeição sobre a participação da criança está entre os homens (85,9%). Entre as mulheres a taxa cai para 80,4%. Na divisão por faixas etárias, 86% dos entrevistados entre 35 e 44 anos consideraram a performance imprópria para menores mesmo com a participação dos pais.

1852,4,,"O ministro do Trabalho, Ronaldo Nogueira, por meio da Portaria nº 1.129, publicada nesta segunda-feira (16) no Diário Oficial da União, eliminou um truque de vagueza que havia sido inserido por Dilma Rousseff na Instrução Normativa SIT nº 91/2011 sob pretexto de “combater trabalho escravo”.

A instrução normativa de Dilma dizia, absurdamente: “A constatação administrativa de trabalho em condição análoga à de escravo realizada pelo Auditor Fiscal do Trabalho, bem como os atos administrativos dela decorrentes, independem do reconhecimento no âmbito criminal”.

Ou seja, Dilma havia colocado que basta a existência de “jornada exaustiva” e “condições degradantes” para que o trabalho pudesse ser classificado como escravo. O objetivo do truque era tornar vaga a definição do que é escravidão e dar aos auditores fiscais do trabalho o poder de definirem quais os alvos de ataque. Em muitos casos, esses ataques eram feitos a adversários políticos extrema esquerda, principalmente os que possuem propriedade rural.

Para evitar este tipo de truque, o ministro do Trabalho, Ronaldo Nogueira, definiu corretamente os itens que configuram trabalho escravo. Assim, é preciso que exista submissão do trabalhador a trabalhos forçados, ou restrição da locomoção do trabalhador (em razão de dívida contraída ou cerceamento de qualquer meio de transporte), ou vigilância ostensiva (para reter o empregado no local de trabalho) ou posse de documentos ou objetos pessoais do trabalhador para retê-lo no local de trabalho.

Ainda que “condições degradantes” e “jornada exaustiva” sejam um problema, certamente não configuram trabalho escravo. Por exemplo, quando tenho uma proposta comercial muito extensa, acordo 3 horas da manhã para elaborá-la. Isso acontece em períodos de sobrecarga (para posterior compensação). Para mim, isto não é um problema, desde que tudo esteja de acordo com os combinados. Mas mesmo que fosse um problema, não é trabalho escravo. Quem ainda quiser reclamar de “condições degradantes” e “jornada exaustiva” pode fazê-lo, mas esses itens, em isolado, não são trabalho escravo. E o ministro do Trabalho fez o correto ao emitir a portaria.

Saem perdendo os grupos de extrema esquerda, que vivem se valendo de subterfúgios para tentar aumentar o desemprego e, principalmente no campo, arranjar motivos para tomar propriedades de adversários políticos.

Uma prova de que a portaria do ministro do Trabalho incomodou a extrema esquerda é que a Secretária Nacional da Cidadania, Flavia Piovesan (inserida no governo Temer de forma errada na ilusão de que era possível existir conciliação com a ultra esquerda) deu piti.

Flávia, em entrevista ao UOL, lançou uma coleção de falsidades (que permitem até que Temer a processe, se quiser). Por exemplo, ela diz:

Sobre a minha avaliação, em primeiro lugar, a portaria viola frontalmente a Constituição, viola a legislação nacional, o artigo 149 do Código Penal, e os tratados de direitos humanos ratificados pelo Brasil, sobretudo os tratados da OIT (Organização Internacional do Trabalho).

Porém, ela não conseguiu demonstrar qual é a violação. Dizer apenas que “viola artigos” é fácil. Isso qualquer um faz. Mas fazer a exposição dos artigos é outra coisa, que ela não conseguiu fazer, ao contrário do que feito neste texto, logo no início, para demonstrar a vagueza intencional da instrução normativa de Dilma, que agora perde o poder de chantagem sobre adversários políticos.

Pela legislação penal brasileira, o trabalho escravo avilta a dignidade humana. E aí que é importante ter inclusive alusão à jornada exaustiva e condições degradantes. São componentes que a nossa legislação prevê, e a portaria vai na contramão e reduz drasticamente o alcance conceitual de trabalho escravo. Ou seja, o trabalho forçado só vai ser caracterizado se houver cerceamento da liberdade.

Aqui temos outra mentira de Flávia, pois na verdade o problema da instrução normativa de Dilma é que ela citava “jornada exaustiva” e “condições degradantes” como fatores que configuravam escravidão, mesmo que de forma isolada. E isso é muito grave, pois até me impediria de fazer horários alternativos para elaborar uma proposta comercial. Era absurdo, de fato.

Não bastando isso, uma segunda preocupação é esvaziar a autonomia dos auditores fiscais, que têm agora que atuar acompanhado da polícia.

Mas qual o medo de atuar acompanhado da polícia? Se a investigação é sobre trabalho escravo, tem que estar junto com a polícia sim. Ficou muito estranha essa preocupação de ter que ir junto com a polícia. Aqui Flávia Piovesan afrontou o trabalho da polícia e ficou devendo uma explicação coerente de seus motivos. Seria bom gravar Flávia quando ela for questionada sobre esses motivos. É útil também avaliar a linguagem corporal dela durante a resposta. Estar preocupada com a necessidade de auditores estarem acompanhados da polícia é, de fato, um ponto preocupante.

Flávia cai em contradição de novo a seguir, quando é questionada sobre se o atual governo teria tolerância à escravidão:

Eu teria cautela porque já tive um debate de duas horas com o ministro do Trabalho, justamente porque eu defendi a publicação da lista suja, que no final foi judicializada. Então, o que eu digo é que é inaceitável e que nós temos que lutar pela revogação dessa portaria em caráter de urgência, porque realmente os danos são acentuados, as violações de direitos são gravíssimas.

Ué, se ela realmente acredita no que diz, por que tem cautela? É claro que ela sabe que trabalha com vagueza intencional e não um um argumento de fato. É piti histérico, pura e simplesmente.

Em tempo: a situação de trabalho escravo se configura na importação de médicos cubanos. O governo Temer também precisaria dar um jeito nisso, preferencialmente exigindo que os médicos tenham o direito de permanecer no Brasil, cortando unilateralmente os vínculos com o governo ditatorial cubano. Neste caso, o Brasil poderia inclusive pensar em intervenção militar em Cuba para retirar as famílias dos médicos, que o governo cubano mantém como reféns para forçar os médicos escravos a ficarem no Brasil.

Segundo o Estadão, o ministro Luiz Fux está com atitudes muito esquisitas em relação ao julgamento de Cesare Battisti no STF.

O ministro Luiz Fux, do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), esclareceu que liberou para julgamento na Primeira Turma do STF não o mérito do habeas corpus de Cesare Battisti contra uma possível extradição, mas, sim, uma questão de ordem. O que o ministro quer discutir, em primeiro lugar, é o local onde deve ser analisado o pedido da defesa do ex-ativista italiano: se na própria turma, ou no plenário do STF.

Por decisão de Fux, uma eventual extradição de Battisti, que está nos planos do Governo Federal, está impedida de ser realizada enquanto não fosse julgado o mérito do habeas corpus.

Para alguns ministros do STF, esse julgamento tem de ser no plenário, por se tratar de um pedido contra um possível ato do presidente da República. Fux, no entanto, diz que a questão é mais ampla.

“Vou levar questão de ordem para a turma, porque, depois do Mensalão, se decidiu que a extradição era na turma. Agora quem executa a extradição? Presidente da República. E mesmo assim o Supremo mandou que a extradição fosse julgada nas turmas.

Não tem essa questão ‘vai pro plenário, vai pro plenário’”, disse Fux.

Segundo ele, é preciso decidir também se o que o italiano pede é uma “questão extradicional ou é uma questão digamos assim passível de habeas corpus”. Segundo ele, se for ato administrativo, seria até uma questão que caberia mandado de segurança, em vez de habeas corpus.

Questionado sobre se, após superadas essas questões preliminares, é possível julgar ainda no mesmo dia o habeas corpus, o ministro deixou em aberto. “Ou julga na hora ou julga depois. Eu vou levar só a questão de ordem”, disse.

1858,4,,"O megapicareta George Soros, 87, disponibilizou US$ 18 bilhões (R$ 56,7 bilhões) de seu patrimônio para alimentar a Open Society Foundations, entidade esquerdista fundada por ele em 1984 e que tem operações de desestabilização cultural e econômica em mais de 120 países. As informações são da Folha.

A contribuição —feita por décadas, mas revelada só nesta terça (17) — foi uma das maiores de um doador privado a uma única organização na história e a torna a segunda maior dos EUA, atrás da Fundação Bill e Melinda Gates.

Por décadas, Soros fazia à Open Society Foundations doações anuais entre US$ 800 milhões e US$ 900 milhões.

A previsão é que o sujeito transfira mais US$ 2 bilhões (R$ 6,3 bilhões) aos cofres da organização nos próximos anos.

Como tudo é picaretagem mesmo, embora o dinheiro esteja à disposição da Open Society, não há disposição da fundação em aumentar suas operações e os recursos estão sob controle do Soros Fund Management, a empresa familiar do megainvestidor. Parece até piada, mas não é.

Os programas de Soros envolvem promoção da erotização infantil e campanhas de ódio contra a polícia. Em suma, tudo aquilo que pode levar à desestabilização.

No Brasil, Soros financia entidades de extrema esquerda como Mídia Ninja e Agência Pública, e deve financiar a campanha de Luciano Huck à presidência em 2018. Há quem diga que ele pode comprar até apoio de direitistas com essa grana. A ver.

1861,2,,"A Polícia Federal deu mais um passo em sua cruzada para desfazer a atuação política do Procurador-Geral da República, Rodrigo Janot, e fechou sozinha um acordo de delação com o publicitário Marcos Valério. Desde 2012, o operador do mensalão do PT vem tentando firmar um acordo de redução de pena com a PGR sem sucesso. A suspeita de que Roberto Gurgel, seu sucessor na PGR, Rodrigo Janot e o ministro do Supremo Tribunal Federal, Joaquim Barbosa, atuavam para proteger o ex-presidente Lula no processo do mensalão e blindá-lo sobre o esclarecimento de um dos crimes mais mistérios da história política do país está prestes a ser confirmada.

O publicitário afirmou que chegou propor falar na justiça sobre o envolvimento de Lula no assassinato de Celso Daniel, mas que teria sofrido uma campanha de difamação por parte de sites e blogs controlados pelo partido do ex-presidente-  ""PT tem esta mania de querer desmoralizar as pessoas para tirar a credibilidade destas pessoas"", afirmou Marcos Valério ao juiz Sérgio Moro.

Segundo o publicitário, em 2013, o então ministro do Supremo Tribunal Federal, STF, Joaquim Barbosa o encaminhou ao então Procurador-Geral da República, Roberto Gurgel, que esteve à frente da PGR entre julho de 2009 e 14 de agosto de 2013. O procurador teria dito que estava com pressa e não tinha interesse em fazer nenhum acordo com Marcos Valério.

Valério afirmou em depoimento prestado em 2012 que o empresário Ronan Pinto havia ameaçado Lula, seu ex-secretário da Presidência, Gilberto Carvalho, e o então ministro da Casa Civil, José Dirceu, por isso teria recebido os 6 milhões de reais do PT,

Na época, o então presidente do STF, Joaquim Barbosa admitiu saber do teor das denúncias feitas por Valério, mas não respondeu se considerava a acusação grave e disse que tomou conhecimento ""não oficial"" do depoimento dado por Marcos Valério. ""Tomei conhecimento oficioso, não oficial"". Leia AQUI.

Não é normal que um presidente do STF e um procurador da República ignorem uma denúncia envolvendo chantagem e um homicídio.

O publicitário confirmou ao juiz Sérgio Moro que foi procurado  pelo ex-secretário geral do PT Silvio Pereira, que lhe pediu dinheiro para pagar um homem que estava chantageando o ex-presidente Lula, ameaçando revelar detalhes sobre o assassinato de Celso Daniel. O ex-secretário geral do PT queria R$ 6 milhões para comprar o silêncio do empresário Ronan Maria Pinto. Segundo Marcos Valério, o dinheiro saiu de um esquema de desvios na Petrobras relativo à um contrato envolvendo o aluguel de sondas através do banco Schahin, que entregou o dinheiro ao amigo de Lula, o ex-pecuarista José Carlos Bumlai.

""Nós estamos com problema. O presidente está com um problema muito sério. Está sendo chantageado por uma pessoa e essa pessoa tá exigindo um recurso no valor de R$ 6 milhões."" Justificou Silvio Pereira. Marcos Valério ficou com receio de participar da jogada, sabendo que se tratava de algo muito sério e pediu ao então secretário geral do PT para deixá-lo de fora da operação.

O amigo de Lula, José Carlos Bumlai, Ronan Maria Pinto, o ex-tesoureiro do PT, Delúbio Soares e o ex-secretário do PT, Silvio Pereira, foram presos temporariamente na 27ª fase da Operação Lava-Jato, a Carbono 14. Na ocasião, Bumali confirmou o repasse do dinheiro ao PT.

Marcos Valério Fernandes assinou um acordo de delação premiada com a Polícia Federal no processo conhecido como mensalão tucano. A informação sobre a colaboração foi confirmada pela PF no dia 19 de julho deste ano.

Em junho de 2016, Valério entregou ao PGR mais uma proposta de delação premiada. Em 24 de março de 2017, Rodrigo Janot informou que não havia interesse por parte do órgão na delação do réu e recusou o procedimento.

A lei permite que acordos de colaboração premiada sejam fechados tanto pelo Ministério Público como por delegados de polícia, mas há uma disputa sobre essa competência. O procurador-geral da República, Rodrigo Janot, entrou com uma Adin (ação direta de inconstitucionalidade) no Supremo no ano passado para impedir os acordos com a polícia.

Segundo a PF, o processo foi encaminhado para o Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). Marcos Valério já prestou vários depoimentos à corporação referentes à delação. A homologação do acordo está sob análise do STF porque há, no processo, investigados com foro privilegiado.

Acompanhe abaixo uma parte do depoimento de Marcos Valério que prestou ao juiz Sérgio Moro no qual esclareceu parte do episódio envolvendo o assassinato de Celso Daniel:

1862,2,,"A ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff têm evitado comentar o esgotamento do prazo determinado pela justiça para que devolva ao governo os 144 objetos que levou dos Palácios do Planalto e da Alvorada que pertenciam ao acervo da Presidência da República. A petista, que chegou a devolver um tapete que levou ""por engano"" do Palácio da Alvorada para Porto Alegre, carregou consigo mais de uma centenas de presentes oficiais para Porto Alegre, mas que deveriam integrar o patrimônio da União. Enfim, os bens públicos voltarão para onde nunca deveriam ter saído.

O ex-presidente Lula também terá que devolver 568 itens deixaram de ser registrados pelos responsáveis pelo acervo da Presidência. Os cargos eram ocupados por funcionários coniventes com os governos petistas. Entre os presentes recebidos, estão obras de arte dignas de museus, valiosas joias e peças decorativas exclusivas. Em 2016, por exemplo, Dilma recebeu uma escultura em bronze do artista plástico italiano Guido Veroi, chamada “Solidariedade e Paz”, com a figura de um anjo. Já Lula, em 2007, chegou a ganhar duas taças de prata folheadas a ouro 18 quilates. Entre os itens desaparecidos, estão ainda travessas, aparelhos de som, vasos decorativos e até um faqueiro de prata que foi presente da rainha Elizabeth II, da Inglaterra.

Dilma tinha conhecimento sobre o Decreto 4.344/2002, que permite que ex-presidentes carreguem consigo apenas os itens de natureza personalíssima como fotos, diplomas e títulos, ou itens de consumo pessoal, como remédios, trajes e alimentos especiais. A partir destes fatos, é perfeitamente razoável supor que Lula e Dilma roubaram o patrimônio do povo de caso pensado.

O ministro Walton Alencar Rodrigues, relator da matéria no Tribunal, chegou a afirmar que o desaparecimento dos itens mostra um sistemático desvio do patrimônio público e o retrato da incapacidade de apuração dos fatos. “É como se, a cada dia, no período de 2010 a 2016, incluídos sábados, domingos e feriados, mais de dois itens do patrimônio nacional desaparecessem de dentro da Presidência da República, apesar da fiscalização exercida por inúmeros agentes de segurança”, disse Rodrigues,, ciente que os tais agentes de segurança eram, em sua maioria, pessoas alocadas pelos governos do PT ao longo dos últimos treze anos.

A petista tem tentado uma trégua junto a interlocutores no Palácio do Planalto, no sentido de devolver os objetos em sigilo, sem muito estardalhaço. Seus contatos, no entanto, alegam dificuldades para convencer os responsáveis pelo acervo a tratar o assento de forma mais discreta. Ele alegam que o caso gerou expectativas na imprensa e que setores do TCU fazem questão de esclarecer os fatos o quanto antes.

1863,2,,"Governo pega pesado com Maduro e determina suspensão garantia do Banco Central para novas operações com a Venezuela

Por determinação do governo Temer, o Banco Central (BC) acaba de suspender novas operações com a Venezuela no sistema de compensação de pagamentos de comércio exterior. A informação já foi inclusive publicada no Diário Oficial da União, que confirmou a suspensão de operações por meio do Convênio de Pagamentos e Créditos Recíprocos (CCR).

A suspensão do convênio não impede o comércio exterior entre o Brasil e a Venezuela. A medida afeta apenas a garantia dada pelo BC de recebimento do pagamento pelo bem exportado ou de reembolso no caso de importação. O convênio também permitia acesso a empréstimos do sistema financeiro.

O motivo da suspensão foi a inadimplência da Venezuela no âmbito do CCR, mecanismo do qual fazem parte os bancos centrais dos países-membros da Associação Latino-Americana de Integração (Aladi): Argentina, Bolívia, Brasil, Chile, Colômbia, Equador, México, Paraguai, Peru, Uruguai, Venezuela e República Dominicana.

O CCR foi criado para facilitar o intercâmbio comercial na região, ao reduzir as transferências internacionais. As compensações feitas pelos bancos centrais ocorrem quadrimestralmente.

No último dia 8, o BC foi informado pelo Banco Central do Peru, centralizador de todas as transações, que a Venezuela não havia feito o pagamento relacionado ao convênio. O saldo devedor é de US$ 262,5 milhões. Por isso, o BC decidiu fazer a suspensão.

O presidente da Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, chegou a esboçar uma reação, mas foi aconselhado por seus ministros a não comentar a decisão do governo brasileiro. A esperança é que o país consiga reverter a decisão do BC efetuando o pagamento dos débitos.

1864,2,,"PF descobre desvios de R$ 200 milhões em contratos com a Venezuela durante governo Dilma. Base do esquema era no RS

O que há em comum entre a ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff, o  Rio Grande do Sul e a Venezuela? Os noticiários não deram nenhum destaque para a operação deflagrada há uma semana pela Polícia Federal no Rio Grande do Sul para investigar lavagem de dinheiro na exportação de máquinas e implementos agrícolas do Brasil para a Venezuela envolvendo o braço agrícola da estatal da Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) e duas exportadoras, uma brasileira e outra venezuelana. O esquema criminoso ocorreu exatamente entre o primeiro e o último ano do primeiro mandato da ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff

Na operação, foi preso em Madri, com ajuda da Interpol, Arid Jiobanny Garcia Vargas, dono da Tracto América, empresa de trading na Venezuela, fornecedora de máquinas agrícolas para a PDVSA.

De acordo com reportagem da Reuters, ""O esquema, que vinha sendo investigado pela PF e pela Receita Federal há três anos, teria sido usado para lavar dinheiro desviado da PDVSA através de superfaturamento na venda de máquinas agrícolas e teve uma movimentação superior a 200 milhões de reais entre 2010 e 2014.

De acordo com a PF, a Tracto América, fornecedora da PDVSA, comprava no Brasil, através da empresa gaúcha América Trading, máquinas agrícolas para serem entregues à estatal, a preços superfaturados. Os valores a mais eram redistribuídos através de várias empresas de fachada como pagamento de ""consultorias"" à trading e terminavam em contas no exterior.

""Tudo era feito como uma operação lícita, com pagamentos em contratos de câmbio. O dinheiro entrava na conta da exportadora e dali era mandado para várias contas, no Brasil e no exterior, a pretexto de pagamentos de consultorias. Em algumas ocasiões nem chegava a entrar na conta da exportadora, ia direto para essas empresas"", disse o procurador da República Juliano Karam.

O pagamento de consultorias chegava a somar entre 30 e 40 por cento dos valores pagos pelas máquinas. Segundo a PF, eram várias camadas de lavagem de dinheiro que ainda não foram totalmente decifradas.

Apenas o movimento de lavagem de dinheiro identificado até agora chega a 200 milhões de reais entre 2010 e 2014, segundo a PF. No entanto, os investigadores dizem que não conseguiram até agora investigar todo o espectro do negócio.

""Em apenas um dia, três contratos cambiais de 50 milhões de reais foram pagos pela estatal venezuelana e nada chegou para os fornecedores"", disse o procurador.

Os recursos eram pagos em contas bancárias no Brasil, mas principalmente no exterior, incluindo Panamá, Estados Unidos e Suíça.

De acordo com a PF, cinco empresas sediadas no Rio Grande do Sul forneciam máquinas agrícolas para o esquema. Há indícios que duas delas sabiam do esquema.

""Uma delas criou uma das empresas de fachada para prestar consultoria para a exportadora e também recebia comissão"", disse o delegado Alexandre Isbarrola.

As investigações começaram há três anos depois que a Receita Federal detectou um crescimento de cerca de 20 vezes em um ano na receita da America Trading, uma empresa até então quase desconhecida localizada em Passo Fundo, no noroeste do Rio Grande do Sul.

""Além disso, a empresa tinha uma despesa muito grande no percentual de despesas na sua operação, em comissões pagas nas operações de exportação"", disse Paulo Roberto Passos, superintendente da Receita no Rio Grande do Sul.

A fiscalização acendeu a luz vermelha e a PF foi acionada. A operação incluiu seis mandados de busca e apreensão em Porto Alegre e nas cidades gaúchas de Canoas, Passo Fundo e Erechim, além de São Paulo e Americana (SP), em sedes da América Trading e da Intersugar consultoria, uma das empresas usadas no esquema. Seis pessoas foram alvo de condução coercitiva e Arid Vargas foi preso em Madri.

A empresa de Vargas está sob investigação na própria Venezuela por crimes cambiais e contrabando. Em 2012, a empresa foi encampada, ainda no governo de Hugo Chávez. No entanto, o esquema teria continuado pelo menos até 2014, de acordo com informações prestadas pela PF.

A PF e o Ministério Público planejam agora abrir uma nova etapa de investigação com a colaboração do Ministério Público venezuelano. ""Vamos fazer agora um pedido de cooperação, repassando as informações que temos e pedindo informações"", disse o procurador.

A Reuters procurou a América Trading nos dois telefones que constam no site da empresa, mas ninguém respondeu. O mesmo ocorreu com as tentativas de contato com a Intersugar"".

1865,2,,"O presidente Michel Temer está colocando um fim em seis décadas de utopia burocrática que permitiu o surgimento de uma elite privilegiada de funcionários públicos, Durante anos, os brasileiros sonharam com com os cargos do setor público e viam as oportunidades criadas pela classe política como um refúgio seguro e repleto de vantagens inimagináveis no setor privado. Os benefícios garantidos pelo estado à elite do funcionalismo público brasileiro impressionariam mesmo algumas das empresas mais ricas Vale do Silício.

Segundo a matéria publicada no Boomberg, Temer está desencorajando os aspirantes aos cargos cobiçados oferecidos pelo Estado, enquanto ele se move para reduzir uma máquina burocrática notoriamente inchada por anos de negligência de outros governantes. O governo estuda a venda de dezenas de ativos do estado em um moderno programa de privatização. Até mesmo a Casa da Moeda Nacional entrou na lista, o que não pode ser uma boa notícia para os 2.700 funcionários. É improvável que o comprador continue a fornecer-lhes acesso sem custo aos dentistas, médicos, nutricionistas e massoterapeutas no local. Em nenhum lugar do mundo há tantas estatais quanto o Brasil, que vê boa parte de suas receitas sendo sugadas por uma pequena classe de privilegiados, enquanto o resto da população enfrenta dificuldades em praticamente todos os serviços essenciais, como saúde, segurança, saneamento, educação e outras atribuições do Estado.

Os planos de Temer representam um pesadelo para aqueles que sonhavam em ingressar no serviço público com salários que podem chegar a R$ 23 mil. Nada mal para um jovem de 23 anos recém formado e sem qualquer experiência. A ideia do governo é limitar o salário inicial de servidores até o teto de R$ 5 mil. Algo ainda acima da média do setor privado. Pela nova política, o servidor que ingressar no serviço público daqui para frente levará mais tempo para alcançar o teto do salário do funcionalismo.

A modernização da máquina pública preocupa uma categoria que já ficou conhecida no Brasil como ""os concurseiros"", gente da classe média que tem tempo para se dedicar aos estudos, visando a segurança, estabilidade, mordomias e os altos salários garantidos até então pelo Estado. Os aspirantes que se prepararam para o exame de serviço público em centenas de escolas estão revendo seus planos e o um setor de preparação de testes que, até recentemente, estava crescendo, sentiu o baque. Depois de Temer colocar um congelamento em empregos do setor público no ano passado, o corpo estudantil da Rede Educacional Alub despencou para 1.900 para 1000 alunos. ""Todo mundo está preocupado"", disse Franklin Andrejanini, o coordenador da escola.

Para aqueles que ainda estão tomando aulas, o que Temer está fazendo é uma traição. ""Escolhemos esse caminho para um trabalho que gostamos, pela qualidade de vida"", disse Juliana Perisse, 23, que começou a estudar há um ano. ""As reformas estão eliminando nossa aposentadoria e nossos direitos"".

Muitos no setor público falam sobre direitos quando enfrentam Temer não deve mexer com o status quo. Eles estão preocupados não apenas com a perda segurança do emprego, mas dividendos de trabalho, como os oferecidos pela empresa de administração aeroportuária Infraero. Entre eles: dois planos de seguro de saúde; subsídios para gasolina, mantimentos, incluindo alimentos especiais para dietas, e vouchers de almoço generosos mesmo durante as três férias e até mesmo durante os feriados.

O trem para a felicidade começou a rodar quando Brasília foi criada, derrubada de um platô árido e praticamente no meio do nada, embora com o prémio visualmente famoso do célebre arquiteto brasileiro Oscar Niemeyer projetando muitas de suas grandes estruturas fluidas. Algo tinha que ser feito para atrair talentos para a savana das praias do Rio de Janeiro e as luzes brilhantes de São Paulo. A atração: salários e brindes fora da oferta oferecidos por empregadores privados ou mesmo muitos ministérios em outros locais, como motoristas e vôos gratuitos.

Agora, aproximadamente 250.000 pessoas, ou 40 por cento da força de trabalho em Brasília, ocupam empregos do governo - sem contar os empregados pelo Judiciário, o Congresso Nacional e os militares. Eles são todos em classes privilegiadas, muitos pertencentes a clubes, um para quase cada profissão e muitas vezes subsidiado, com piscinas e campos de ténis.

Os brasileiros que vivem longe da capital vêem isso como uma cidade de mocassins mimados, enquanto a taxa de desemprego nacional é de 13 por cento. Mesmo alguns habitantes locais estão fartos, apesar do fato de seus meios de subsistência podem ser ameaçados por um serviço civil encolhido.

Mauricio Vale Borges, um óptico de 48 anos, disse que o gigante ""estado paternalista"" foi um erro desde o início e é ridículo agora. ""Está fora de contato com a realidade do país"".

Ele também administra uma loja de óculos em Brasília, onde viu os funcionários públicos desfrutar de benefícios que ele só pode sonhar. ""Não tenho ciúmes com eles"", disse ele. ""Estou com vergonha por eles"".

""Temos 151 empresas estatais que empregam mais de meio milhão de pessoas com orçamentos de 1,2 trilhão de reais"", disse Gil Castelo Branco, economista do Contas Abertas. Essa soma, ele ressaltou, é apenas do tamanho do PIB argentino.

Temer está reduzindo a tinta vermelha no Brasil e já cortou as mamatas de artistas, sindicalistas e de movimentos sociais que consumiam bilhões do dinheiro do contribuinte. Não é por acaso que o presidente do Brasil tem sido alvo de ataques sistemáticos de todos os lados, inclusive dos meios de comunicação, que viram as generosas verbas publicitárias do governo minguarem para menos da metade do que era gasto pelos governos de esquerda. Os ataques parte justamente das elites que sempre se beneficiaram da generosidade exacerbada do Estado burocrático, inclusive de setores da Polícia Federal, Procuradoria-geral da República e do Supremo Tribunal Federal. A ordem no momento é derrubar o presidente a qualquer preço, antes que ele acabe com mais privilégios.

A ampliação da distribuição de riquezas no país está sendo feita gradativamente, através da redução da inflação e dos juros, onde mais dói no bolso do trabalhador. O temor dos grupos contrários ao governo é o de que a população comece a se dar conta de que as mudanças promovidas pelo governo estão apresentando resultados imediatos em suas vidas.

Segundo o ministro do Desenvolvimento Social, Osmar Terra, a meta inicial do programa é atender, nos próximos 12 meses, entre 1 milhão e 1,5 milhão de famílias cadastradas no Bolsa Família. Atualmente, 13 milhões de famílias recebem o benefício.

“O objetivo é que essas pessoas possam progredir, ter uma vida melhor, uma renda melhor. Acho que o Bolsa Família não é objetivo de vida de ninguém. A média do Bolsa Família é de R$ 180. [O programa] é para evitar que as famílias mais pobres cheguem à miséria. Um programa para que essas pessoas possam se manter enquanto não tiverem outra opção. O que estamos buscando é dar outra opção”, disse Osmar Terra à Agência Brasil.

De acordo com o ministro, a adesão ao Progredir e o eventual aumento da renda, caso o beneficiário consiga um emprego, não acarretará na exclusão imediata do Bolsa Família. “Não vai ter exclusão automática de ninguém do programa. Vamos, inclusive, manter o Bolsa Família por dois anos para quem conseguir emprego com carteira assinada e ganhar até dois salários mínimos. Teremos uma série de regras que garantam que essas pessoas tenham o Bolsa Família enquanto precisarem, mas que elas possam almejar ter uma vida melhor”, argumentou o ministro. Além disso, as famílias que deixarem o Bolsa Família mas, posteriormente, perderem a nova fonte de renda poderão voltar a receber o benefício.

Segundo Osmar Terra, em parceria com o programa, grandes empresas disponibilizarão vagas de empregos especificamente para beneficiários do Bolsa Família e do Cadastro Único. “Os maiores empregadores do Brasil estabelecerão uma cota de emprego para o público do Bolsa Família. Estamos com um amplo programa de capacitação de mão de obra com o Pronatec [Programa Nacional de Acesso ao Ensino Técnico e Emprego], Sistema S, vários níveis de capacitação. Teremos programa de qualificação, empreendedorismo e geração de emprego”.

As informações sobre o programa serão repassadas às famílias pelo sistema de pagamentos, pelos Centro de Referência de Assistência Social (CRAS) e também pela internet. “As pessoas vão poder se cadastrar em um portal que vamos criar, regionalizado, em que as pessoas interessadas em emprego se cadastrem e as empresas oferecem as vagas. Isso vai ser um salto importante no que tem hoje em relação ao programa”, explicou Terra.

A cerimônia de lançamento do programa está marcada 11h desta quarta-feira, 27, no Palácio do Planalto.

1867,2,,"O governo Temer bem que tentou colocar um fim no famigerado programa Ino­var-Auto criado em 2018 pela pela ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff dentro de sua política fiscal de favorecer o setor automotivo nacional. Mas diante da resistência dos parlamentares que também aprovaram Medidas Provisórias indecentes para o setor, o governo preferiu evitar o desgaste e esperar o programa de Dilma caducar em 2018. O ex-presidente Lula e seu filho caçula Luis Claudio Lula da Silva são réus em uma ação penal envolvendo a venda de Medidas Provisórias que beneficiaram o setor automotivo nacional.

Desde o início do ano, o governo Temer vinha tentando substituir o Ino­var-Auto por um novo programa que contempla as regras estabelecidas pela  Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC). O novo plano, batizado de Rota 2030, promete reenquadrar o Brasil nas normas do comércio internacional. Isto significa uma redução drástica nas alíquotas de carros importados.

Para blindar a indústria nacional da concorrência e permitir que os fabricantes nacionais obtivessem lucros estratosféricos, o governo Dilma garantiu condições tributárias generosas às empresas com fábrica no Brasil e dificultou a entrada de carros importados mais competitivos no mercado impondo sobretaxas de até 30% no valor dos veículos através do IPI, além dos cerca de 35% de taxa de importação. A política de Dilma praticamente eliminou a participação de importantes empresas no mercado. Um ano antes do Inovar-Auto, A Kia chegou a vender no mercado brasileiro 80 000 veículos. Este ano, o volume será de menos 7 000 unidades.

O programa Rota 2030 deve tornar a vida das montadoras nacionais mais difícil. Carros como Mercedes, BMW e Audi passarão a ter preços bem próximos dos atuais praticados para modelos como Chevrolet Cruze, Corolla e Honda Civic.

Para conseguir fazer frente aos carros importados, a indústria nacional vai ter que reduzir seus preços, caso queira sobreviver. Empresários do setor tentam convencer o governo, no sentido de garantir outros incentivos, mas já ouviram um não como resposta. Nas negociações em curso, o governo já deixou claro que não pretende conceder benefícios antecipados. Quem quiser se beneficiar de alguma forma, terá que apresentar primeiro a contrapartida. A única promessa do governo é a de reduzir impostos na medida em que as empresas conseguirem produzir carros menos poluentes. Este será o critério do governo, que espera concluir o programa Rota 2030 ainda este ano. A queda nos preços dos veículos nacionais deve alcançar todos os segmentos, na medida em que concorrentes similares importados comecem a chegar ao mercado.

Eu já tinha ouvido um burburinho sobre o assunto, mas trago pra vocês a última informação que tive no XIII Congresso Internacional de Nutrição Funcional e Esportiva desse final de semana.

Sabe aquele sal rosa que você paga uma fortuna por ele? Não serve para consumo humano!

Esse foi o tema da palestra da pesquisadora Conceição Trucom. Ela é química, cientista, palestrante e escritora sobre temas voltados para alimentação natural, bem-estar e qualidade de vida.

Ela avaliou 2 amostras de sal rosa e encontrou em uma das amostras basicamente gesso, carbonatos e sulfatos principalmente de ferro e silicatos (areia);

Quanto mais rosa mais resíduo. Por isso a diferença brutal de preços;

O sal rosa do Himalaia não é falso. Ele é assim mesmo: contaminado com sais de ferro e sílica inorgânica (areia ou quartzo que são abrasivos e não é assimilável pelo organismo humano) que são insolúveis e gesso (CaSO4•½H2O), um sal a base de cálcio (inadequado à saúde humana);

O sal rosa não se dissolve em água, mesmo durante várias horas em repouso. E todo sal tem que dissolver em água;

Um sal para consumo humano não pode, não pode mesmo, conter insolúveis: sejam traços ou percentuais acima de 10 ppm. Não pode;

Tem um elevado teor de flúor e areia neste famoso sal, que usa a expressão Himalaia para soar melhor, quando na verdade vem do Paquistão. O excesso de flúor altera nossa Glândula Pineal ou Epífise e areia mexe com crianças, problemas renais;

Assustado(a)? Eu fiquei!

Mas, lembre-se, você é livre pra tomar suas decisões!

E não deixe de compartilhar.

E ai, você já sabia de tudo isso sobre o sal do himalaia? Agora ja sabe, não marca bobeira e compartilhe com quem você gosta, afinal não vai querer que eles consumam o sal do himalaia.

O entorpecente pode causar atitudes iguais aos dos canibais, afirmam as autoridades responsáveis pela prisão de suspeitos que estavam com a droga no Ceará.

Segundo a polícia, a Metilona não é produzida em solo brasileiro e seus efeitos são poucos conhecidos no Brasil. No entanto, os efeitos são mais perigosos e se assemelham aos do Esctasy. “Pode chegar a causar nos seus usuários o efeito do canibalismo, segundo relatos que nós levantamos fora do Brasil, nos Estados Unidos”.

As autoridades responsáveis do Amazonas, não escondem a preocupação com a possível entrada das drogas no estado. “Isso me deixa muito preocupado, isso me assusta, caso a droga realmente chegue ao Brasil, a nossa juventude está perdida”, revelou policial que estuda o caso.

1872,1,,"A empresa do bilionário Jeff Bezos começou nesta quarta (18) a vender eletrônicos no país com taxas menores que as praticadas pelos concorrentes, que viram suas ações despencarem na Bolsa. A Amazon injetou R$ 112 milhões na filial brasileira entre março de 2016 e fevereiro deste ano.

A empresa do bilionário Jeff Bezos começou nesta quarta (18) a vender eletrônicos no país com taxas menores que as praticadas pelos concorrentes, que viram suas ações despencarem na Bolsa. A Amazon injetou R$ 112 milhões na filial brasileira entre março de 2016 e fevereiro deste ano.

A Amazon começou a vender produtos eletrônicos no Brasil à 0h desta quarta (18), derrubando as ações dos concorrentes na Bolsa e utilizando uma estratégia que é baseada em uma de suas principais vantagens competitivas: muito dinheiro em caixa.

Qualquer marca, loja ou mesmo pessoas físicas podem se cadastrar no sistema de marketplace, usado pela Amazon, para vender seus produtos. Ao menos por enquanto, são permitidos apenas eletrônicos — celulares, videogames, televisões, acessórios etc. —, mas a empresa não descarta expandir para outros ramos.

A fim de se tornar mais atraente para quem quer vender, a Amazon cobra uma taxa menor que seus concorrentes (10% sobre o preço, contra de 12% a 15%, nas outras empresas) e financia as vendas — o comprador pode pagar qualquer produto a prazo, em até 10 vezes, mas o vendedor recebe o valor total, à vista, da própria Amazon. As medidas requerem dinheiro em caixa. Em 2016, o lucro líquido da Amazon foi de US$ 2,37 bilhões, o maior de sua história.

Na prática, é como se a Amazon atuasse como um banco.""Na verdade, a gente não entra muito nesse meandro, mas do ponto de vista do vendedor é isso"", responde Alex Szapiro, principal executivo da Amazon no Brasil, em entrevista ao BuzzFeed News. ""A gente quer dar a melhor oferta de financiamento para o comprador, sem onerar o vendedor.""Entre março de 2016 e fevereiro deste ano, segundo um documento registrado pela empresa na Junta Comercial de São Paulo (Jucesp), a Amazon injetou R$ 112 milhões em sua filial brasileira.

A estratégia de usar dinheiro contra a concorrência já foi usada pela Amazon várias vezes, principalmente nos Estados Unidos. Uma história narrada no livro ""A Loja de Tudo — Jeff Bezos e a Era da Amazon"" (Intrínseca, 2014), do jornalista Brad Stone, serve para exemplificar o ponto. Por volta de 2010, a Amazon decidiu comprar a empresa Quidsi, dona do site Diapers.com (""Fraldas.com"", em inglês). A princípio, as fundadoras não quiseram vender.

O obstáculo colocou a estratégia da Amazon em curso: robôs passaram a monitorar os preços na Diapers.com — e os mesmos produtos eram vendidos por 30% a menos na Amazon, automaticamente. Em seguida foi lançado o Amazon Mom, que à época oferecia um desconto adicional de 30% (em cima do preço que já estava abaixo da média), entre outras vantagens. Nessas condições, um pacote de Pampers que custava US$ 45 no Diapers.com poderia ser comprado por R$ 30 na Amazon — o prejuízo da empresa, apenas com fraldas, seria de aproximadamente US$ 100 milhões em três meses sob esse esquema, de acordo com o livro.É pelos investidores conhecerem bem essa estratégia que, desde quarta-feira passada (11) — quando o jornal Valor Econômico noticiou em primeira mão a entrada da Amazon no setor de eletrônicos —, as ações das principais empresas do ramo tiveram quedas significativas: B2W (-22%), Magazine Luiza (-20%), ViaVarejo (-16%), MercadoLivre (-15%).

Dona do Submarino, da Americanas.com e do Shoptime, a B2W anunciou medidas para combater a entrada da Amazon no mercado antes mesmo de o fato acontecer. ""Viemos preparando a B2W desde 2012, compramos 13 companhias em tecnologia e logística desde então, e isso cria barreiras no mercado"", disse Fabio Abrate, diretor de relações com investidores, em entrevista ao Valor Econômico publicada ontem.E a expansão parece estar só começando.Outro documento registrado pela Amazon na Junta Comercial, em julho, mostra que a empresa comprou um imóvel em Cajamar (SP). Boa parte das vagas abertas na empresa são na área de tecnologia da informação, e os funcionários trabalharão em Cajamar.Essas informações sugerem que os planos podem incluir uma expansão dos serviços da Amazon Web Services — que é líder mundial em soluções na nuvem e está disponível no Brasil desde 2011 —, área mais lucrativa da empresa.A Amazon não confirma nem nega. Questionado sobre o assunto, Szapiro desconversa: ""Sobre estratégia a gente acaba não comentando.""

Para conseguir realizar seu trabalho, Hadrian possui um telescópio articulado de 28 metros em seu interior.

Para colocar os tijolos corretamente, ele utiliza um desenho assistido por computador em 3D com a representação da casa. Argamassa ou adesivo podem ser usados na ponta de sua estrutura. Conforme imagens abaixo:

A fabricante responsável pelo robô, Fastbrick Robotics, pretende lançar a primeira versão comercial do protótipo até o ano que vem.

“O Hadrian reduz o tempo total de construção de uma casa padrão em aproximadamente seis semanas,” disse o CEO Mike Pivac.

“Devido ao elevado nível de precisão que ele alcança, a maioria dos outros componentes, como cozinhas e banheiros, pode ser fabricada em paralelo e simplesmente montada logo que o assentamento de tijolos estiver concluído”.

Pivac espera que o robô não “roube” empregos de humanos, mas sim que crie novas vagas no mercado. “A máquina irá preencher o vazio que existe devido à diminuição do número de pedreiros disponíveis, cuja média de idade é quase 50 na Austrália”, disse.

1882,1,,"Quando se configura um novo roteador Wi-Fi, existe uma recomendação repetida à exaustão, que diz o seguinte: escolha uma senha segura e selecione o protocolo WPA2, que não possui as vulnerabilidades de outras tecnologias mais antigas, como o WEP. Isso deixa de ser verdade a partir de hoje.

Leia mais: Como se proteger contra a falha que deixou o Wi-Fi vulnerável

Um conjunto de falhas graves encontradas no WPA2 torna inseguras as redes Wi-Fi espalhadas pelo mundo. Ao explorar as vulnerabilidades, uma pessoa mal intencionada pode interceptar o tráfego entre o dispositivo e o roteador, obtendo informações sensíveis, como senhas e dados bancários, ou injetando conteúdo malicioso em sites legítimos, abrindo caminho para a distribuição de malwares.

Como toda falha de segurança importante, ela ganhou um nome: KRACK, um acrônimo para Key Reinstallation Attacks (ou Ataques de Reinstalação de Chaves, em uma tradução livre). As brechas foram descobertas pelo pesquisador de segurança Mathy Vanhoef, que é categórico: “O ataque funciona contra todas as redes modernas de Wi-Fi protegidas”.

O alvo do ataque não é o roteador, mas os dispositivos conectados a uma rede Wi-Fi, sendo que os mais afetados são os que rodam sistemas operacionais Linux e Android 6.0 ou superior. No entanto, “os pontos fracos estão no padrão Wi-Fi, não em produtos ou implementações individuais. Portanto, qualquer implementação correta do WPA2 provavelmente será afetada”, diz Vanhoef.

Este vídeo de quatro minutos mostra como é possível interceptar o tráfego de um dispositivo Android conectado a uma rede Wi-Fi considerada (até ontem) segura:

No vídeo, Vanhoef utiliza como exemplo o site de relacionamentos Match.com, que trafega as informações por uma conexão segura (HTTPS). Ao interceptar a rede, é possível forçar a exibição de uma versão não segura da página. A partir daí, qualquer dado fica disponível para quem estiver espionando a rede (perceba como é fácil visualizar a senha enviada em texto puro).

O funcionamento detalhado do KRACK está disponível nesta página. Em termos simples, quando você se conecta a uma rede Wi-Fi, um aperto de mão (handshake) é feito para verificar se o seu dispositivo tem a senha correta. Além disso, você recebe uma chave de criptografia que é utilizada para proteger qualquer dado subsequente. A falha permite resetar essa chave e, com isso, descriptografar todo o tráfego da vítima.

Na prática, qualquer rede Wi-Fi moderna está vulnerável. Os ataques funcionam contra redes domésticas e empresariais, afetando tanto o WPA quanto o WPA2. Indo mais a fundo, se o protocolo da sua rede for GCMP (mais conhecido como WiGig) ou WPA-TKIP, a falha é ainda pior, porque permite não apenas descriptografar o tráfego, mas também injetar conteúdo malicioso. O AES também é afetado.

E o que fazer quando o protocolo mais seguro se torna inseguro? Vai existir um WPA3? Provavelmente não tão cedo. Mas as principais empresas de sistemas operacionais, smartphones, roteadores e qualquer outra coisa que se conecte ou crie uma conexão Wi-Fi já foram contatadas para desenvolver um patch que corrija a falha. Caso surja alguma atualização de segurança, não adie a instalação.

O grande problema é que a maioria dos roteadores vai demorar para receber uma atualização de firmware (ou nem vai receber, o que é mais provável).

Este dia será lembrado como o dia de uma vitoriosa jornada de democracia, onde mais de 60% do eleitorado atendeu à convocação democrática e compareceu, de maneira cívica e pacífica, manifestando seu apoio à paz , à democracia e à soberania na  Venezuela.

Essa vitória adquire ainda mais importância histórica por ter se dado em meio a uma torpe tentativa de cerco e aniquilamento do país liderada pelo governo estadunidense, império que busca derrotar os povos e nações que lutam por  justiça social, inclusão social e autodeterminação.

1892,4,,"1) Esse cara do vídeo abaixo se chama Diego Bargas, e como pode ver nas imagens que postei aqui nos coments, ele se comporta mais como militante político do que como jornalista isento. Sendo assim, que credibilidade teria um torcedor do PT entrevistando eu, um artista que está literalmente na lista negra do PT?

2) Que tipo de jornalista cultural vai conversar sobre um filme de ficção/comédia e não faz uma pergunta sequer sobre direção, roteiro, fotografia, atuação e outros aspectos artísticos e cinematográficos?

3) Porque o mesmo cara que estava uma semana atrás defendendo a liberdade para todos artistas e que pedofilia é uma coisa e arte é outra, agora teve um surto moral e se mostra inconformado com uma obra artística de ficção, roteirizada, onde nada daquilo aconteceu na vida real? Chego até mesmo a pensar que na verdade ele estaria escandalizado porque retratamos o pedófilo como um vilão, sem relativizar a pedofilia. Seriam os pedófilos uma nova minoria a ser protegida das piadas?

4) Ao perguntar em tom de desaprovação se “pode fazer piada com pedófilo e psicopata” o cara que recebe um salário como “especialista de cinema” (uii) demonstra desconhecer momentos clássicos da sétima arte como o hilário piloto de “Apertem os cintos o piloto sumiu” ou o mais recente “Quero matar meu chefe”. Isso pra ser breve e ir parando por aqui. Os exemplos são incontáveis. Todo mundo conhece, menos o burrão aí. Aliás dá uma olhadinha nas imagens que postei aqui nos coments. O cara que reprova psicopatas na ficção parece admirá-los bastante na vida real.

5) Infelizmente a melhor parte desse encontro não foi filmada. Após cortarem a entrevista, ele se levantou dando suas bufadinhas e disse “Eu quero dizer que não gosto do filme”. Eu respondi: “E eu quero dizer que não me importo nem um pouco com a sua opinião”. AUHAHUAHUAHUAHUHA! Ele vai entrar aqui, ler isso e ficar irritadinho porque escrevi. E essa é a melhor parte de ter feito esse texto. HAAHAHHAH.

6) Se você assistir o que foi respondido e ler a matéria que ele publicou verá que eu tinha razão. Esse cara já tinha a matéria pronta, ignorando o óbvio, que o Fabrício tão pacientemente explicou. Eu, como já conhecia o tipo, nem me dei ao trabalho, pois saquei qual era a dele desde a primeira pergunta.

1893,4,,"Em meio às pressões para que o governo restitua o imposto sindical, o Ministério do Trabalho estuda liberar para os sindicatos valores recolhidos nos últimos anos, mas que não foram distribuídos às entidades. A medida pode injetar no cofre dos sindicatos até R$ 1 bilhão, valor estimado do saldo residual.

As contribuições foram retidas pelo governo em razão de erros no preenchimento das guias pelas empresas entre 2008 a 2015. Desde então, os valores permanecem intocáveis. Quando não for possível identificar a quem pertence o recurso, a proposta é dividir o valor entre todas as entidades.

O ministro do Trabalho, Ronaldo Nogueira, montou um grupo de discussão com sindicalistas para tratar do assunto. O valor do saldo residual ainda está em fase de cálculo. A estimativa de R$ 1 bilhão é das entidades.

Bem, o que temos aqui é a indignidade política levada a um patamar que tornaria Neville Chamberlain – premiê britânico que fez um acordo com Hitler só para ser traído em seguida, permitindo o avanço das tropas nazistas – até mesmo uma pessoa digna.

Ao lutar para dar dinheiro para os sindicatos, Temer sabe que estará doando grana para gente que vai usar essa verba principalmente para fazer campanha contra ele. Ou será que ele acha que não vão usar esses recursos para imprimir panfletos pedindo “Fora Temer”?

Claro que Temer luta para se safar, mas poderia muito bem priorizar outro tipo de gente em vez de dar recursos para quem tem como esforço central o desgaste do governo Temer.

É conseguir ficar num nível de dignidade bem abaixo dum Neville Chamberlain.

1894,1,,"Senadores intensificaram a articulação por uma votação secreta para deliberar sobre as medidas cautelares e o afastamento impostos ao senador Aécio Neves (PSDB-MG). O tema está em discussão pela cúpula do Senado e tem como objetivo diminuir o desgaste de senadores que pretendem reverter a suspensão das funções parlamentares do tucano.

A votação no plenário da Casa está marcada para a próxima terça-feira (17). Por 6 votos a 5, os ministros do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) decidiram na quarta-feira (11) que medidas cautelares, como o recolhimento noturno, determinadas a deputados federais e senadores devem ser submetidas ao aval da Câmara ou do Senado.

O regimento interno do Senado prevê votação secreta para deliberação sobre prisão de parlamentar. Na semana passada, a Coluna do Estadão já havia adiantado que senadores debatiam a possibilidade de tornar a votação sigilosa. A Constituição, porém, não diz que modelo deve ser adotado. Até 2001, o artigo 53 estabelecia votação secreta --a expressão foi suprimida pela Emenda Constitucional 35.

Segundo um integrante da Mesa Diretora do Senado, a votação será como determina o regimento --ou seja, fechada. Reservadamente, um ministro do Supremo disse ao jornal ""O Estado de S. Paulo"" que, como a regra interna da Casa determina o modelo de votação, há espaço para tal interpretação.

""Seguir o regimento e a Constituição, e respeitar e proclamar o resultado livre do plenário, que é soberano, é meu dever como presidente (do Senado)"", disse Eunício Oliveira (PMDB-CE) ao comentar a discussão sobre o sigilo da deliberação. A senadora Fátima Bezerra (PT-RN) criticou a articulação na Casa: ""Eu espero que não haja nenhuma manobra e o voto seja aberto.""

No caso da prisão do senador cassado Delcídio Amaral (sem partido-MS), em novembro de 2015, o então presidente do Senado, Renan Calheiros (PMDB-AL), tentou realizar a votação de forma sigilosa. Parlamentares, no entanto, reagiram e entraram com um mandado de segurança contra a iniciativa.

O pedido foi deferido pelo ministro Edson Fachin com base na Emenda Constitucional 35. ""Não havendo menção no art. 53, § 2.º, da Constituição, à natureza secreta da deliberação ali estabelecida, há de prevalecer o princípio democrático que impõe a indicação nominal do voto dos representantes do povo"", escreveu Fachin na decisão. Na ocasião, Aécio apoiou o entendimento do Supremo.

Para o líder do PMDB no Senado, Raimundo Lira (PB), não está claro se o caso de Delcídio definiu uma regra para as próximas votações. ""Não posso dizer com absoluta certeza que aquela votação definiu um padrão a ser seguido ou se precisa, em cada caso, ser revertido o voto secreto em voto aberto', afirmou.

O professor de Direito Constitucional Paulo de Tarso Neri, porém, afirmou que ""a regra é a votação aberta"". ""Só se permite voto secreto quando o texto expressamente diz que deve ser secreto', disse. ""Já houve votações abertas na Câmara. Por exemplo, a cassação de Eduardo Cunha. Se até a cassação, que é muito mais grave, é aberta, votação menos gravosa também tem de ser transparente.""

Senadores da oposição --que são minoria e defendem punição a Aécio-- dizem que dificilmente a Casa vai manter as medidas cautelares impostas ao senador tucano. Para Randolfe Rodrigues (Rede-AP), há um acordo de proteção ao tucano firmado entre PMDB e PSDB. Pelas suas contas, os votos pela manutenção das medidas impostas a Aécio podem chegar a 30 senadores caso o PT feche questão pelo afastamento do tucano.

Após o mal-estar causado pela nota em que o PT criticou a decisão do Supremo em relação a Aécio, o líder da minoria no Senado, Humberto Costa (PT-PE), afirmou que sua bancada deve votar unida para manter o tucano afastado do cargo. ""O Senado vai ter de entrar no mérito da discussão. Agora nós vamos discutir se as coisas que têm contra o Aécio justificam ou não essa recomendação do Supremo. Eu vou defender que nós votemos para seguir a recomendação"", disse Costa.

Com nove inquéritos abertos no Supremo, Aécio foi afastado do mandato e submetido ao recolhimento domiciliar noturno por decisão da Primeira Turma do Supremo no dia 26 de setembro com base no relato dos delatores do Grupo J&F. (Colaboraram Andreza Matais e William Castanho)

1897,1,,"Cinco anos depois de chegar ao mercado brasileiro, a Amazon finalmente deverá expandir sua loja online para além de livros, ebooks e Kindles. De acordo com o Valor, a empresa intensificou as conversas com empresas de tecnologia e varejo para começar a vender eletrônicos já na semana que vem — mais especificamente, no dia 18 de outubro.

O funcionamento deverá ser o mesmo que a Exame revelou em maio: em vez de vender diretamente aos consumidores, a Amazon deverá focar no marketplace, intermediando vendas de outros comerciantes. O Valor afirma que, nos últimos 15 dias, a Amazon se aproximou de lojistas, entregando documentos que explicavam como preparar o catálogo na Amazon e gerenciar os produtos ofertados.

Inicialmente, as vendas na Amazon brasileira deverão se restringir ao setor de eletrônicos, como celulares, câmeras, computadores, monitores e TVs, mas a ideia é “ampliar a lista até o fim do ano” e, no longo prazo, “trazer para o país toda a variedade de produtos e serviços que oferece nos Estados Unidos”, de acordo com o jornal.

É um segundo passo em relação ao marketplace de livros. Em abril, a Amazon passou a permitir que outras editoras, sebos e pessoas físicas trabalhassem na plataforma, abrindo caminho para a venda de livros usados e aumentando a oferta de 150 mil para 300 mil obras em português. O envio fica por conta do vendedor parceiro, não da Amazon. 50% das vendas da empresa no mundo vêm de marketplace.

A Amazon não comentou a informação do Valor. Provavelmente saberemos mais na semana que vem.

1899,3,1.0,"President Trump has regularly accused others of inventing news, while he himself has spread rumors based on little or no factual information. For instance, he has claimed on various occasions that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the November election and that he lost in New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused into the state to cast illegal votes against him.

How can such rumors be countered? Research I’ve recently published in the British Journal of Political Science suggests one possible solution: The spokesman refuting the rumor should be an unlikely source, someone whose personal and political interests would be better served if the rumor were true.

[We can’t find any evidence of voting fraud in New Hampshire.]

Of course, rumors have long pervaded U. S. politics. In recent years alone, polls have shown that wide swaths of the American public accept the “birther” rumors suggesting that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Other surveys demonstrate significant support for “truther” beliefs that the George W. Bush administration either allowed or was behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Such rumors are troubling for a democratic society. Disseminating misleading and untrue information fosters distrust of institutions and may keep Americans from meaningfully engaging in the civic arena.

Increasing partisan polarization, among other things, has sped up the circulation of such political rumors among both Democratic and Republican partisans. Republicans were more likely to accept rumors questioning Barack Obama’s citizenship, while Democrats were more likely to believe in 9/11 conspiracies. With unified Republican control of the federal government, surely rumors will grow among those left of center.

Previous research in this field suggests that attempts to counter political rumors often fail. Ironically, just repeating rumors that you’re trying to debunk may in fact reinforce those rumors. Those individuals who accept a rumor as true may in fact become more certain of their false beliefs the more it’s repeated, doubling down if there’s new sources of information that either supports or denies it.

[This is what Trump voters said when asked to compare his inauguration crowd with Obama’s]

My own research suggests some solutions to this problem. In 2010, I conducted a pair of experiments on rumors surrounding the debate over the Affordable Care Act (ACA). I focused on the “death panel” rumor, which falsely claimed that elderly and sick individuals would be allocated health care based on their supposed worth to society. While demonstrably false, these rumors were widely disseminated by several conservative politicians and media figures and embraced by many members of the emerging tea party.

I exposed respondents to varying pieces of information about the death panel rumor. Some respondents were told only the rumor itself; others were exposed to the rumor but also different corrections to the rumor. In the “authoritative” correction, respondents were shown quotes from American Medical Association and AARP experts discrediting the rumor. In the “partisan” correction treatments, respondents were shown a quote from either a Democratic or Republican lawmaker similarly debunking the rumor.

These different corrections had very different effects. Quotes from “authoritative” sources debunking death panels managed to change some minds but quickly lost their power. Within a week, people exposed to this information had opinions that did not differ from the respondents who were given no information at all about the death panel controversy. Corrections from a Democratic politician similarly worked with some but then faded.

On the other hand, when I followed the death panel rumor with a Republican politician’s correction, the debunking worked. All the respondents — Republicans and Democrats alike — were far more likely to reject the veracity of death panels. And a week later, the citizens exposed to the quote from the Republican remained more likely to reject the death panel rumor — although again, the power of that correction faded.

The lessons of my study are clear. Just as important as how a rumor is debunked is who does the debunking. Politicians who support good public policy by speaking against their partisan interests — in this case, Republicans speaking out against the death panel rumors — are considered credible sources by citizens from across the ideological spectrum.

When fighting “fake news,” politicians and the media should present the right authority. In our politically polarized time, we may be able to harness the power of partisanship to stop the spread of misinformation.

1901,1,,"O ministro das Relações Exteriores da Coreia do Norte, Ri Yong-ho, afirmou que a vontade do país asiático é “fazer chover fogo” sobre os Estados Unidos, em resposta às palavras do presidente americano, Donald Trump, que ameaçou perante a ONU destruir Pyongyang.

O chanceler norte-coreano se pronunciou desta maneira ao receber a uma delegação da agência de notícias russa “Tass” que visitou Pyongyang, segundo informou hoje a imprensa local.

“A vontade de todo o pessoal militar e das pessoas da República Popular Democrática da Coreia (RPDC, nome oficial do país) é fazer chover fogo sobre os EUA, que falou em destruir totalmente a RPDC”, disse Yong-ho.

Ele também afirmou que o programa nuclear norte-coreano é “fruto precioso da sangrenta luta do povo coreano para defender o destino e a soberania do país, diante da prolongada ameaça nuclear dos imperialistas americanos”.

O chanceler norte-coreano participou da sessão extraordinária da Assembleia Geral das Nações Unidas, no mês passado, onde Trump, durante seu discurso, ameaçou “destruir totalmente a Coreia do Norte” por conta de seus seguidos testes de armas.

Os seguidos testes armamentísticos e a troca de provocações entre Washington e Pyongyang elevaram no último ano a tensão regional para níveis sem precedentes desde o fim da Guerra da Coreia (1950-1953).

Um representante de uma delegação russa que visitou o país explicou após sua visita que as autoridades norte-coreanas lhes asseguraram que preparam o próximo lançamento, como um teste, de um novo míssil balístico intercontinental (ICBM) com capacidade real para alcançar a costa oeste americana.

Os especialistas especulam com que Pyongyang poderia realizar este lançamento coincidindo com o Congresso do Partido Comunista Chinês, que começa no próximo dia 18 de outubro, ou durante a visita de Trump à região, marcada para acontecer entre os dias 2 e 14 de novembro.

1902,1,,"O e-Delivery da Volkswagen agora é internacional. O caminhão acaba de ser lançado em Hamburgo, na Alemanha, onde acontece o Innovation Day, evento promovido pela holding Volkswagen Truck & Bus.

Previsto para começar a operar em frotas-piloto em 2018, incluindo o Brasil, o caminhão elétrico, que foi inteiramente desenvolvido no Brasil, é ideal para entregas urbanas e possui autonomia de até 200 km.

Para isso utiliza um motor elétrico WEG AL160, que desenvolve 109 cv de potência, com torque máximo de 50,3 mkgf. Complementa o trem-de-força a transmissão automatizada Allison.

Desenvolvido em parceria com a Eletra com baterias de íon-lítio LiFePO4 o que lhe garante a autonomia de 200 km. O e-Delivery está disponível nos modelos de 9 t e 11 t de PBT.

Alinhado à realidade do mercado, o modelo abrange duas opções de recarga: a recarga de oportunidade rápida, em que é possível assegurar 30% da carga em apenas 15 minutos, e pode ser realizada várias vezes ao longo da rota do veículo para aumentar sua autonomia; ou a recarga lenta, que em três horas, atinge a carga máxima.

No conceito plug-in, as baterias do veículo são recarregadas por um carregador externo padrão CCS. Sua operação é bastante simples e amplamente difundida na indústria de elétricos.

O e-Delivery é equipado com um freio com três estágios de regeneração, que podem ser ajustados conforme a condição de carga ou preferência do motorista. O freio regenerativo atua antes do freio pneumático, para desacelerar o veículo, recuperando até 30% de energia durante a frenagem e utilizando a mesma para recarregar as baterias.

O veículo possui também o sistema Eco-Drive Mode, que reduz o consumo de baterias dependendo da condição de carga do veículo, ajustando a demanda de corrente das baterias de acordo com a condição de operação do veículo.

“O e-Delivery representa um marco na história da Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus. Trata-se de uma plataforma totalmente nova, desenvolvida no Brasil, na busca de alternativas de mobilidade nas cidades. Ele insere, definitivamente, a engenharia brasileira na rota global de tecnologia”, afirma Roberto Cortes, presidente e CEO da MAN Latin America.

O recurso funciona de maneira semelhante ao que existe em aplicativos como o Google Maps e uma versão beta do WhatsApp: você abre uma janela de conversa individual ou em grupo, seleciona um limite de tempo (15 minutos, 1 hora ou 8 horas) e seus amigos passarão a ser informados sobre sua localização com base no GPS do seu smartphone.

É útil para organizar um encontro com várias pessoas, por exemplo (considerando que elas também estejam no Telegram, claro). No caso dos compartilhamentos feitos em conversas em grupo, também será possível visualizar um mapa com a localização de todos os membros em tempo real.

A novidade já está disponível para todos os usuários na versão 4.4 do Telegram, que trouxe novos idiomas (o português do Brasil já era suportado) e um novo player de mídia, que reproduz os arquivos em MP3 que você enviar ou receber — com direito a playlists e capas de álbuns.

A SSP não informou características dos suspeitos nem como eles agiram. Ninguém foi preso.

A secretaria disse que a Polícia Militar foi chamada para atender a ocorrência às 5h30 desta quarta na Rua Isabel de Castela, próximo à praça do Pôr do Sol.

Ribas foi encontrado baleado no braço e no ombro, foi socorrido ao Hospital das Clínicas, mas não resistiu aos ferimentos.

Em nota, a CDN, agência de comunicação para a qual Ribas trabalhava, disse que há 19 anos ele fazia o mesmo trajeto para ir ao trabalho. “Um dia muito triste para nós. Oswaldo Ribas, nosso colega, nos deixou hoje cedo.”

A nota diz que ele era dos primeiros a chegar ao trabalho, “sempre com bom humor, profissionalismo e generosidade”. Ele deixa esposa, três filhos e dois netos.

A agência informou que Oswaldo Ribas era gerente e editor da CDN Análise e Tendências na área internacional, atendeu grandes grupos empresariais e bancos públicos como Banco do Brasil, Petrobrás, BNDES e Telefónica. Era graduado em Jornalismo pela Unip e em Ciências Sociais pela USP.

Ribas foi editor de Finanças Internacionais da Gazeta Mercantil e também foi redator, repórter e editor assistente nas editorias de Internacional e Economia do jornal O Estado de S. Paulo, quando participou do projeto de edição brasileira do The Wall Street Journal Americas.

De acordo com um estudo de 2014 da Unicef, a Índia abriga um terço dos casamentos infantis mundo afora

Supremo Tribunal derruba exceção que permitia a relação sexual entre um homem e esposa com idade entre 15 e 18 anos. Decisão histórica afetará milhões de meninas indianas.

De acordo com um estudo de 2014 da Unicef, a Índia abriga um terço dos casamentos infantis mundo afora

Manter relações sexuais com uma esposa que tenha menos de 18 anos de idade é ilegal, e o ato será considerado estupro, decretou o Supremo Tribunal da Índia nesta quarta-feira (11/10), em uma decisão histórica que afetará milhões de meninas.

Casamentos para meninas com menos de 18 anos e meninos com menos de 21 anos de idade são proibidos na Índia, mas a prática do casamento infantil é mantida em áreas rurais e atrasadas, em meio à fraca aplicação das leis, à pobreza e às normas sociais patriarcais.

A lei indiana considera estupro o sexo consentido com uma garota com menos de 16 anos, mas uma exceção havia sido feita para a relação sexual entre um homem e sua esposa com idade entre 15 e 18 anos.

E justamente essa exceção foi derrubada pelo Supremo Tribunal nesta quarta-feira, explicou o ativista Vikram Srivastava, fundador do grupo voluntário Independent Thought (Pensamento Independente, em tradução livre), que foca em questões de direitos de mulheres, crianças e comunidades marginalizadas.

""O veredicto diz que, se um homem tiver relações sexuais com uma esposa com menos de 18 anos, trata-se de um crime"", disse Srivastava. ""Se a esposa menor de idade apresentar queixa contra o marido dentro de um ano após o ato sexual, a pessoa pode ser processada por estupro.""

""Estou muito feliz com o veredicto do Supremo Tribunal. O veredicto dá um impulso à campanha nacional intitulada 'Beti bachao e beti padhao'"", disse Srivastava, usando a fase em hindi que significa ""salve a menina e eduque a garota"". O veredicto, no entanto, não será aplicado retrospectivamente.

De acordo com um estudo de 2014 da Unicef, a Índia abriga um terço dos casamentos infantis mundo afora. A última edição do relatório de saúde familiar nacional da Índia mostrou um declínio significativo no número de noivas menores de idade – 27% das meninas indianas se casaram antes dos 18 anos em 2016, contra 47% em 2006.

Apesar dos esforços para capacitar garotas e mulheres e endurecer penas, a Índia segue entre os dez países com as maiores taxas de casamento infantil no mundo, ao lado de Níger, República Centro-Africana, Chade, Mali, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Guiné, Sudão do Sul e Moçambique.

1907,3,1.0,"Uma pesquisa no buscador Google com a pergunta, em inglês, “o Facebook está nos escutando?” dá mais de 70 milhões de resultados e diversos tutoriais sobre desligar microfones e evitar vigilância. Quando a pergunta muda para “o Google está nos escutando?”, o resultado são 58 milhões de resultados. Os números mostram uma das maiores inquietações de usuários de internet mundo afora: a sensação de que as maiores empresas de tecnologia do planeta estão bisbilhotando nossas conversas e empurrando propaganda com base no que falamos com amigos e parentes.

A pesquisa no Google também dá como resultado uma infindável série de relatos de pessoas que afirmam que nunca pesquisaram, curtiram ou visitaram páginas relacionadas a um assunto e, após conversar com alguém sobre o tema, começaram a ser bombardeadas com publicidade. O site especializado em publicidade Brainstorm9 até criou um termo para classificar a suposta audição do Facebook, o Cumbucagate — um “escândalo” que teria acontecido após um dos apresentadores do podcast Braincast ter recebido propagandas de cumbucas na rede social Instagram (plataforma que pertence ao Facebook) após falar sobre cumbucas em sua casa.

Afinal, o aplicativo do Facebook e os sistemas operacionais do Google estão nos ouvindo? Ou é apenas lenda urbana?

Google e Facebook têm estimados 50% de todo o mercado de publicidade digital no mundo, com nenhum outro player passando de 5% da fatia de mercado. Em um universo onde a informação sobre o usuário é diretamente ligada à capacidade de direcionar a publicidade correta, e faturar em cima disso, converter as conversas das pessoas em informação publicitária de maneira bem sucedida seria extremamente lucrativo.

Mas nos escutar exigiria um pressuposto tecnológico: a existência de capacidade técnica para ouvir, interpretar, filtrar palavras chaves, classificar e enviar as conversas pela rede (o que inclui usar o pacote de dados de celular ou a rede Wi-Fi). Tudo isso com as cerca de 2 bilhões de pessoas que compõem a plataforma do Facebook ou os 2 bilhões que têm o sistema operacional Android, do Google. O algoritmo de audição ainda teria de entender português, uma língua falada por não mais de 300 de milhões de pessoas.

Fatemeh Khatibloo, analista da companhia de pesquisas digitais Forrester, uma das mais respeitadas dos Estados Unidos, realizou um estudo sobre o caso depois de ouvir de mais de 20 colegas que conversas feitas na vida real — em inglês — aparentavam gerar anúncios no Facebook. A conclusão certamente não é a esperada dos adeptos de teorias conspiratórias. “O processo de filtrar linguagem natural já é difícil na melhor das circunstâncias; adicionando limitações de dados e barulho de fundo, isso se torna material para ficção científica”, escreveu ela em artigo na revista Forbes.

Khatibloo levanta outro empecilho para que aplicativos e aparelhos nos ouçam secretamente. Cerca de 24% da população adulta americana já baixou um bloqueador de propaganda em seus navegadores de internet e a descoberta de escutas ilegais colocaria o mercado de publicidade digital em risco, segundo Khatibloo. “O ambiente de marketing digital só pode aguentar um determinado número de violações de privacidade antes de entrar em colapso”, diz.

Se o público poderia ficar incomodado com um aumento da vigilância, os anunciantes também podem virar vidraça. Para o presidente do grupo de mídia Dentsu Aegis Network no Brasil, Abel Reis, a publicidade é baseada nos dados e registros de atividades que são coletados somente com explícita autorização. “Eu duvido 100% que uma grande companhia aceitasse fazer uso de dados captados sem autorização e ciência das pessoas. Os anunciantes têm cuidados com escândalos e demandam segurança e legitimidade na captação de dados”, afirma.

EXAME procurou o Facebook, que negou quaisquer violações de sua política de dados, afirmou que esse é um boato de internet e disse que qualquer usuário pode ver o motivo pelo qual está recebendo uma propaganda específica. “O Facebook não utiliza o microfone do telefone das pessoas para informar sobre anúncios ou mudar o feed de notícias. Mostramos anúncios com base nos interesses das pessoas e outras informações de perfil — não com base no que elas estão falando. Apenas acessamos o microfone dos telefones das pessoas quando elas estão utilizando ativamente alguma ferramenta específica que requer áudio e somente quando autorizam a utilização, como por exemplo gravação de vídeos”, afirmou a companhia em nota.

O Google informou que não utiliza o áudio dos usuários para direcionar publicidade, apenas para aprimorar o funcionamento do assistente de voz. “As entradas de áudio e voz, por exemplo, o comando Ok Google são armazenados para ajudar e melhorar no reconhecimento de voz e de fala do usuário. Para nós, é fundamental que o usuário esteja no controle e tenha transparência sobre os dados gerados ao utilizar nossos produtos e serviços.”

De acordo com Frederico Silva, diretor da divisão latino-americana de engenharia de software da fabricante de processadores Qualcomm, uma das maiores do mundo, por uma questão de ganho de bateria os dispositivos selecionam palavras chaves a serem escutadas. “Nós criamos tecnologia para ajudar o usuário. É possível processar captação de áudio, mas os direitos e deveres sobre isso é de quem constrói a aplicação. Nós habilitamos o uso das ferramentas e fica a cargo das companhias fazer o melhor uso disso”, diz.

A Apple, fabricante do iPhone, atesta nos termos de uso de sua loja que “as funcionalidades de um app devem estar claras para todos os usuários finais”, caso contrário o desenvolvedor do aplicativo fica sujeito à exclusão da loja virtual. Contatada e questionada sobre a viabilidade técnica de seus celulares estarem nos escutando, a fabricante Samsung informou que “proteger a privacidade dos consumidores e a segurança dos nossos produtos é uma das principais prioridades da Samsung. Se encontrarmos um risco [à segurança do usuário], cuidamos disso imediatamente”.

O Google também informou que promove varreduras de segurança constantes em sua loja, a Google Play, para retirar do ar aplicativos que violem o código de conduta da empresa e que façam uso de informações sem autorização prévia do usuário.

O debate sobre privacidade é antigo e vai além das conversas faladas. Em julho de 2011, a gigante de tecnologia Microsoft realizou um congresso interno onde divulgou um vídeo chamado “Gmail Man”, uma cutucuda ao serviço de e-mail de um de seus principais concorrentes, o Google. O vídeo brincava com um carteiro fictício, que lia a correspondência das pessoas. O Gmail Man era invasivo, procurava por palavras chaves e oferecia produtos com base no que as pessoas enviavam umas às outras. No final, a Microsoft terminava com uma espécie de advertência: “Seu e-mail é seu negócio. O Google o faz o negócio dele”. O intuito era propagandear o Office 365, serviço de e-mails da companhia (que seria, pela lógica, menos bisbilhoteiro).

O vídeo vazou e virou um pequeno fenômeno em círculos da internet que defendiam privacidade digital à época. Algum tempo depois, a Microsoft abraçou a causa e publicou a íntegra em suas páginas no Facebook, Twitter e YouTube.

O que em 2011 era visto como uma ofensa aos direitos de privacidade dos usuários, digno de ser apontado como algo nocivo em um vídeo de uma das maiores companhias do setor, hoje não é mais do que o normal do mercado de tecnologia. O tempo todo plataformas como Google, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Messenger e outros, com cookies do navegador e pixels em websites, monitoram nossas preferências, cruzam nossos dados e nos categorizam em clusters para nos vender propagandas direcionadas.

Estamos sendo vigiados, portanto, e isso, segundo as companhias e especialistas ouvidos pela reportagem, é possível mesmo sem uma rádio-escuta constante. O alento é que podemos monitorar quem nos monitora. Se entrarmos no site da agregadora de dados Navegg, empresa líder na captação de dados para publicidade digital na América Latina, é possível ver nosso perfil pessoal, baseado nos cookies que o computador ou o celular de acesso registrou. O agregador consegue juntar principais interesses, intenções de compra, gênero, faixa etária, estado civil, classe social.

O Google também disponibiliza todas as atividades de seus usuários para que eles possam escolher se querem editar, deletar ou cessar a coleta de informações. Na seção “Controle de Atividade” é possível ver as informações que a empresa coletou de nossa localização, histórico de buscas, de acesso a sites (pelo uso do navegador Chrome) e até das gravações que são guardadas quando usamos o comando de voz “Ok, Google” no celular. De acordo com a empresa, embora os áudios não sejam usados para direcionamento comercial, a geolocalização e os dados demográficos podem, sim, ser usados para este fim.

No site do Facebook, na seção de preferências de ads (facebook.com/ads/preferences/), é possível ver todos os interesses que a empresa supõe que você tenha, desde mídia a pessoas, passando por comidas, estilo de vida, esportes. O Facebook, que exige registro para usar, consegue ver qual é o aparelho de celular e tablet que o usuário tem, se mora longe da família, a qual geração pertence e até qual é a categoria de bens de consumo que tem em casa.

Segundo Adriano Brandão, diretor e fundador da Navegg, é improvável que um modelo como o do “cumbucagate” seja viável. “Temos algumas regras de utilização, como não coletar dados sensíveis a raça, orientação sexual, hábitos sexuais, discurso de ódio, saúde física e financeira, análise de crédito, seleção de recursos humanos. Também há a questão de autonomia do usuário e possibilitamos a desautorização da coleta de cookies, bem como a edição das informações coletadas”, disse.

De acordo com desenvolvedores e programadores consultados pela reportagem, o Facebook e o Google têm um certo poder preditivo, com base nas informações que nós demos para as companhias em troca de usarmos suas plataformas. De posse dessas informações, do registro dos sites que visitamos, das páginas que curtimos, das fotos que gostamos no Instagram, de aonde fomos e demos check-in, de quem está conectado na mesma rede que nós, essas companhias conseguem prever com relativa precisão que tipo de anúncio nos interessa naquele momento.

“Na prática, as pessoas não ligam para privacidade. Elas são bastante entusiastas de mídias sociais, do Instagram, do Facebook. Ninguém lê os termos de serviço que somos obrigados aceitar, usamos a tecnologia para pagar contas, para buscar notícias. Para participar na sociedade contemporânea somos ‘forçados’ a jogar pelas regras e aceitar os termos”, afirma o professor Michael Madary, da Universidade Tulane, especialista em filosofia da mente e ética de tecnologia.

No livro 1984, o escritor George Orwell escreveu sobre as televisões que nos escutariam no futuro e sobre como a vigilância seria uma constante na vida social. Ao seu lado, Aldous Huxley, em Admirável Mundo Novo, falou sobre como nos entregaríamos aos prazeres da tecnologia, “falhando em dar conta de nosso imenso apetite por distrações”.

A distopia já é real. Mas, para começarmos a ter nossas vozes compreendidas, a tecnologia e o poder de analisar e processar dados precisam evoluir um bocado. Quando esse dia chegar, muitos de nós provavelmente aceitaremos os termos de bom grado. Até lá, você pode falar à vontade ao lado do seu telefone.

1908,1,,"Após quatro anos de paciência e pesquisa extensiva, os gatinhos selvagens de areia finalmente foram pegos pelas câmeras, pela primeira vez na história.

Os gatos, com idades entre seis e oito semanas, foram encontrados por uma organização especializada nos felinos, chamada Panthera.

Eles passaram horas tirando fotos e gravaram um vídeo de uma fêmea adulta que acreditam ser a mãe.

A equipe, chefiada pelos biólogos Grégory Breton e Dr. Alexander Sliwa, avistou os gatinhos enquanto voltavam para o acampamento no deserto do Sahara em abril deste ano.

Eles notaram três pares de olhos brilhando na escuridão e não conseguiam acreditar no tamanho da sorte que tiveram quando perceberam o que haviam encontrado.

“Encontrar esses gatinhos foi surpreendente”, disse Grégory Breton, diretor-gerente da Panthera francesa.

“Acreditamos que esta foi a primeira vez que os pesquisadores já documentaram gatinhos de areia selvagem na região africana”.

Os gatos de areia são a única espécie de gatos que vive exclusivamente no deserto, eles podem ser encontrados no norte da África, Oriente Médio e Ásia Central.

Porém, como o time de pesquisa descobriu, é incrivelmente difícil localizá-los devido à sua enorme capacidade de evitarem serem detectados.

A cor de sua pelagem faz com que se camuflem no ambiente, suas patas peludas não deixam nenhuma pegada na areia e eles só viajam na escuridão.

Dessa forma, ter conseguido essas imagens é algo extremamente notável.

E, antes que você pergunte, não é permitido mantê-los como animais de estimação.

Se preferir, assista ao vídeo no Vimeo.

Compartilhe essas fotos com seus amigos que adoram os animais.

A rede social Facebook, o aplicativo de mensagens instantâneas WhatsApp e o aplicativo de compartilhamento de fotos e vídeos Instagram estão apresentando instabilidade nesta quarta-feira, 11, em várias partes do mundo. De acordo com informações do site DownDetector, que monitora postagens em redes sociais sobre problemas, o Facebook e o Instagram estão enfrentando problemas no Brasil, em várias regiões dos Estados Unidos, em diversos países da Europa e também na Ásia. O WhatsApp tem falhas na Europa e no Brasil.

O Facebook e o Instagram confirmaram a falha. “Sabemos que algumas pessoas estão com dificuldade para acessar o Facebook e o Instagram. Estamos trabalhando para normalizar a situação o mais rápido possível"", afirmou, em nota, um porta-voz do Facebook, quando questionado pelo Estado. O WhatsApp enviou uma nota semelhante e diz que está trabalhando para solucionar o problema.

Em relatos nas redes sociais, diversos usuários brasileiros dos serviços reclamam que não conseguem fazer login nos serviços. Às 14h15, os termos Facebook e Instagram dividiam a primeira colocação nos assuntos mais comentados do Twitter. Depois do almoço, a hashtag #facebookdown também estava em evidência no mundo, ocupando a primeira colocação nos Trending Topics mundiais.

Às 18h10, na área para desenvolvedores do Facebook, um membro da equipe postou que as performances estavam apresentando números melhores. ""Embora o problema principal ainda não tenha sido resolvido, acreditamos que os erros da API devem ter diminuído um pouco"".

1915,1,,"Com a vitória por 2 a 1 sobre a Costa Rica, nesta terça-feira, 10, o Panamá se classificou pela primeira vez em sua história a uma edição de Copa do Mundo. O feito, no entanto, aconteceu devido a um erro gravíssimo do árbitro da partida.

Perdendo por 1 a 0 desde os 36 minutos do primeiro tempo, os panamenhos se lançaram ao ataque na segunda etapa. O empate veio logo aos sete minutos, após grande confusão na área. O detalhe é que o lance em que o árbitro guatemalteco Walter Lopez assinalou gol, a bola não entrou no gol. Mas não foi sequer um lance duvidoso: a bola não ficou em cima da linha, mas saiu pela linha de fundo, em tiro de meta para a Costa Rica.

O que poderia ser marcado, na verdade, seria um pênalti em Blas Perez, derrubado por Francisco Calvo no momento em que finalizaria para o gol, na pequena área. Com a queda, ele bateu na bola e Rónald Matarrita rebateu. Na volta, a bola saiu pela linha de fundo. Na súmula, Lopez indicou que o gol goi marcado por Gabriel Torres, que tocou na bola direto do escanteio.

Torcedores, gandulas e até narradores, no momento exato do lance, gritaram gol, e o juiz confirmou alguns segundos depois. Após consulta com o auxiliar e muita reclamação dos costarriquenhos, Lopez manteve sua decisão.

A vaga na Copa foi finalmente confirmada aos 43 minutos do segundo tempo, com o gol da virada de Roman Torres, que aproveitou lançamento da zaga, ganhou do defensor e chutou para gol.

A ida ao Mundial da Rússia foi tão comemorada pelos panamenhos que o presidente do país, Juan Carlos Varela, decretou esta quinta-feira, 11, como ""dia de festa nacional"", dando folga aos estudantes e funcionários públicos.

Em sua conta no Twitter, Varela escreveu que ""é um dia histórico para o país"". ""Amanhã (quinta) será livre para os trabalhadores do setor público e privado. Em um Dia de Festa Nacional também ficam suspensas as aulas nas escolas públicas e privadas do país. Celebrem em família"", completou.

1916,1,,"RUTH MANUS é advogada e professora universitária. Lê Drummond, ouve pagode, ama chuchu com bacon e salas de embarque. Dá risada falando de coisa séria. Não perde um XV de Piracicaba contra Penapolense por nada. Sofre de incontinência verbal, tem medo de vaca e de olheiras, que nem todo mundo.

Frida segue viva não apenas nas grandes árvores de raízes profundas do México, mas no peito de muitos homens e de muitas, muitas mulheres que, ao pensarem em entregar os pontos, lembram-se dela.

Eu tinha 15 anos quando li sua primeira biografia. Há 14 anos, Frida ainda não era uma moda tão latente mundo afora. Lembro-me de falar sobre ela e ouvir os amigos adolescentes perguntarem “quem? Aquela pintora que tem monocelha?”, provocando algo entre minha ira e meu desprezo por reduzirem uma mulher daquele tamanho à insignificância dos pelos.

Tive aquele ciúme besta, coroado pela inútil frase “eu já gostava dela antes de ser modinha”, julgando-me muito mais no direito de usar camisetas com sua cara, de ter sua cara nos meus cadernos, meus cadernos com seus quadros e de ter quadros com suas frases do que todos os demais, por já ter mergulhado em dezenas de livros sobre sua vida, passando pelas cartas que escreveu, pelas fotografias que seu pai tirou e por livros dedicados unicamente à sua relação com Diego Rivera. Hoje tenho a noção de que li pouco, de que sei pouco sobre essa história sem fim e que ainda precisaria de mais 15 anos para falar sobre Frida com alguma propriedade. Mas o conhecimento um tanto quanto raso nunca me impede de seguir sendo aficcionada por ela.

Hoje entendo que a paixão por Frida, sobretudo por mulheres, é algo que aproxima-se de uma questão de sobrevivência. Explico-me. Frida foi uma sobrevivente em todos sentidos da sua vida. Sobreviveu à poliomielite na infância, sobreviveu ao acidente na adolescência, sobreviveu a uma relação falha com a mãe, sobreviveu a uma paixão desmedida pelo pai epilético, sobreviveu aos seus abortos, às suas tantas cirurgias, à sua infindável dor, sobreviveu como mexicana nos Estados Unidos, como latino-americana em Paris, sobreviveu a Diego, com seu amor desenfreado e cheio de desencontros, sobreviveu ao divórcio, sobreviveu a apaixonar-se a casar-se outra vez com este mesmo homem, sobreviveu às traições mútuas, sobreviveu às amputações, sobreviveu o quanto pôde.

Mas mais do que sobreviver, Frida transformou cada fiapo de dor na beleza da sua obra e é exatamente por isso que é mais fácil sobreviver olhando para ela. Parece que, ao lembrarmos de sua bravura ao longo da caminhada, reconhecemos que não podemos parar por causa das nossas pequenas-grandes dores. Ela era uma mulher normal. Não nasceu nobre, não nasceu rica, não nasceu deslumbrante, não nasceu com uma força descomunal. Ela fez-se forte porque a vida assim exigiu. Poderia ter desistido- de pintar, de amar, de lutar por seu país- mas não o fez. Ela poderia, com toda razão do mundo, viver de lamentos. Mas seguiu, linda, viva e cheia de cores.

Frida aprendeu a pintar sozinha. Ser autodidata é algo que a vida frequentemente nos exige em diversas esferas. E é bom poder olhar para ela. É bom podermos nos inspirar nela, dia após dia. Frida pintou na cadeira de rodas e na cama. Que justificativa tenho eu para me acovardar na segunda de manhã? Frida cansou-se da dor, do desamor, dos hospitais, de tentar ser mãe sem sucesso. Do que eu estou cansada? Frida brilhou como pintora, mesmo casada com um dos maiores pintores de sua época, em tempos ainda mais machistas do que os nossos. Do que eu estou com medo? Frida não podia pintar como Diego, com seus murais de 2 por 5 metros. Pintou seus quadros pequeninos, cuja intensidade arrepia até o último fio de cabelo. Qual é a minha desculpa para não fazer o que devo fazer?

Olhar para Frida é olhar para o que há de melhor dentro de nós. Quando entrei na Casa Azul, em Coyoacan, no México, quando toquei suas paredes, quando me sentei em seu jardim, me senti a perfeita mistura entre uma invasora, uma velha amiga e uma abençoada. Frida é a figura mais humana e mais divina que já existiu. Sua proximidade com o céu, o inferno e a terra é visível em cada pincelada. E a sua existência não pode ter sido um mero acaso. Frida existiu por muitas razões. Frida resistiu por muitas razões. Frida segue viva não apenas nas grandes árvores de raízes profundas do México, mas no peito de muitos homens e de muitas, muitas mulheres que, ao pensarem em entregar os pontos, lembram-se dela. Param e lembram-se daquela improvável convivência entre tantas cores e tantas dores. Respiram, erguem a cabeça e seguem seus caminhos, tão doloridos quanto coloridos.

Gracias, Frida, é mais fácil por haver você.

Artista voltarredondense lança projeto de financiamento coletivo para gravar seu primeiro álbum

Matéria publicada em 6 de outubro de 2017, 18:45 horas

Volta Redonda – O músico Lucas Motta, de 24 anos, natural de Volta Redonda, lançou no último dia 3 de outubro um projeto de financiamento coletivo no site Catarse (www.catarse.me/cuidardesonhos) para a gravação do seu primeiro EP solo chamado “Cuidar de Sonhos”. O álbum contará com sete músicas autorais (Temporais, M, Cuidar de Sonhos, Encontro, Cantiga, Vento Frio e Pudera) que traduzem a vivência e percepção do artista sobre tudo o que o rodeia.

– As canções revelam o que eu sou, o que eu fui, e o que eu quero ser. Nestas faixas estão lembranças, reflexões, ambições e segredos. Tudo aquilo que congestiona este eterno trânsito do meu pensar. Sonhar e cantar me permite dizer o que eu nunca conseguiria traduzir em uma conversa normal. Compor, tocar e cantar me permite ser o que eu sempre sonhei – diz Lucas.

O financiamento coletivo é uma espécie de “vaquinha” virtual, onde as pessoas contribuem financeiramente para que um projeto seja realizado. A diferença é que para cada valor doado, o doador pode ganhar uma recompensa, que pode ser um agradecimento, um produto (um disco, no caso do “Cuidar de Sonhos”), pôsteres, camisas, ingressos e até mesmo uma apresentação exclusiva do artista. A meta de Lucas é conseguir arrecadar 20 mil reais em 60 dias para financiar o projeto. Desse total, 35% (R$ 7.000,00) será destinado para a gravação, mixagem e masterização; 12% (R$ 2.400,00) será para o cachê dos músicos; 20% (R$ 4.000,00) será reservado para as recompensas;  7,5% (R$ 1.500,00) para a produção audiovisual; 12,5% (R$ 2.500,00) para a aquisição de equipamentos; e 13% (R$ 2.600,00) é para a taxa que o site Catarse (plataforma de financiamento coletivo) cobra para hospedar o projeto.

O projeto de financiamento coletivo “Cuidar de Sonhos” pode ser acessado em (www.catarse.me/cuidardesonhos).

1922,1,,"Essa história é um jeito fofo de mostrar que o amor não tem gênero, sexo, idade, raça. Ele apenas acontece. Esses dois pinguins machos vivem como um casal na Alemanha, no Zoológico de Bremerhaven.

Depois que os dois passaram anos tentando começar uma família construindo ninhos, o zoológico realizou um teste de DNA em 2005. Eles descobriram que ambos os pinguins eram, de fato, do sexo masculino. Eles se tornaram um casal desde que se conheceram, há 10 anos! Para quem não sabe, é bastante comum que algumas espécies de pinguins tenham comportamento monogâmico.

Dotty e Zee se adoraram desde o primeiro contato.

Eles não são capazes de se reproduzir biologicamente, mas construíram um ninho juntos já no primeiro ano,  comportamento que indica a vontade dos animais em “constituir família” e, normalmente, é observado ente machos e fêmeas da espécie. Esta espécie de pinguim, Humboldt, está em extinção no mundo, com apenas 2000 restantes.

Apesar de tentar encorajar os pinguins a se reproduzir com outras fêmeas, o casal homossexual se recusou a quebrar o vínculo.

Mas o acaso ajudou nessa parte. Uma fêmea, que vive em outro zoológico próximo, deu à luz e rejeitou seu ovo. A equipe do Zoológico achou isso a oportunidade perfeita de testar o instinto paternal dos dois pinguins – e não é que deu certo?

O casal chocou em conjunto o ovo e, depois do nascimento do filhote, dividiu de forma exemplar as tarefas de sua criação, tanto na hora de alimentar quanto de educar a pinguinzinha.

Não é muito fofo?

1925,1,,"Quando podemos dizer que uma tecnologia está “morta”? Para alguns, é quando ela tenta e não consegue atingir uma participação de mercado relevante. Outros são mais radicais: ela só “morre” quando deixa de receber atualizações, ou quando deixa de funcionar.

Há um meio-termo para essa definição: quando a empresa responsável pela tecnologia confirma oficialmente sua morte. Neste final de semana, a Microsoft fez isso com o Windows 10 Mobile.

Joe Belfiore, vice-presidente do Windows, tuitou que a Microsoft continuará dando suporte ao Windows 10 Mobile com “correções de bugs e atualizações de segurança”, mas esclarece que “criar novos recursos e hardware não é o foco”.

Um dos problemas no Windows Phone e W10M é a falta de apps. No Twitter, Belfiore diz que a Microsoft tentou dar todo tipo de incentivo para desenvolvedores: “pagamos dinheiro, escrevemos apps para eles, mas o volume de usuários é muito pequeno para a maioria das empresas investir”.

O executivo diz que migrou para o Android “pela diversidade de apps e hardware”, e lembra que a Microsoft dá suporte a outras plataformas. De fato, nos últimos dias, a empresa lançou o navegador Edge para iOS, e um launcher renovado para Android.

Belfiore recomenda aos fãs de smartphones com Windows: “escolha o que é melhor para você”. Mas, é claro, a esperança por um Surface Phone ou algo parecido nunca morre. A Microsoft aparentemente está trabalhando no Windows Core OS, uma base que permitiria acrescentar módulos ao Windows 10 para adaptá-lo a qualquer tipo de hardware, incluindo PCs, consoles e… smartphones. Lá vamos nós de novo.

1927,2,,"A atriz e militante partidária de extrema esquerda, Paula Lavigne confessou, em entrevista para a Playboy em 1998, que perdeu a virgindade aos 13 anos com Caetano Veloso. Ele já tinha 40.

A Folha escreveu na época:

A atriz e produtora Paula Lavigne, 29, confirmou à Folha declarações dadas à revista “Playboy” que chega às bancas este mês, nas quais diz ter mantido suas primeiras relações sexuais com o compositor Caetano Veloso, seu atual marido, aos 13 anos. Na entrevista, Paula afirma ter perdido a virgindade na festa de aniversário de 40 anos de Veloso.Ela revelou ainda que, quando garota, costumava levantar sua própria saia, com a ajuda da irmã, e cobrar para permitir que os meninos olhassem.

A história voltou a circular na internet após Lavigne e Caetano repudiarem toda a população que protestou contra os casos “MAM” e “Queermuseu”.

Os dois encabeçaram uma campanha intitulada 342 Artes, onde diversos artistas de extrema esquerda foram reunidos “contra a censura” e declararam guerra ao Movimento Brasil Livre e aos políticos que repudiaram os dois episódios. Confira o elenco inteiro dos sicários defensores de conteúdo pornográfico artístico direcionado ao público infanto juvenil aqui:

Caetano, um homem que, aos 40 anos, tirou a virgindade de uma pré-adolescente de 13 anos, não vê problema no fato de uma criança ter sido induzida, pela própria mãe, a tocar o corpo nu de um estranho em público. Era de se esperar.

Muitos anos depois do acontecido, e diante do contexto da campanha do ex casal, a história está causando polêmica nas redes sociais. Internautas estão comentando pelas que o que houve na época foi um abuso a luz da legislação vigente na época.

Consultamos o advogado Rubens Alberto Gatti Nunes para entendermos melhor o caso.  Em parecer, ele explicou ao JornaLivre que a antiga lei penal, vigente na época, tipificaria o caso como estupro de incapaz: “Haja vista que a atriz Paula Lavigna tinha 13 anos, não possuindo capacidade legal de discernir, tratando-se legalmente de estupro presumido. Obviamente não houve representação, o que afastou a persecução criminal, por tratar-se de ação penal condicionada à representação, todavia não se afasta o fato reprovável de manter ato sexual com menor de 12 anos. Se o fato ocorresse nos dias atuais, por força da reforma penal ocorrida em 2009, se trataria de estupro de vulnerável.”, esclareceu.

O advogado afirmou que por mais que Lavigne tivesse consentido na época,  pelo ordenamento jurídico vigente no período, o que houve foi estupro, e se o fato tivesse sido denunciado, o cantor teria sido penalizado: “Pela legislação atual, no art. 217-A do código penal é exposto claramente o estupro de vulnerável, que é ter conjunção carnal – independente de consentimento – com menor de 14 anos. Então qualquer pessoa que transe com uma garota de 13 anos, mesmo que esta seja prostituta – como sabemos que existem casos de prostituição infantil – é crime de estupro segundo a legislação vigente. E pela legislação antiga também entende-se por estupro, mesmo que consentido ou não”.

“O artigo 224 do código penal de 1940 – vigente da época – dizia-se que presume-se a violência se a vítima é menor de 14 anos, então automaticamente o estupro é presumido. Não havia a legislação que tem hoje, que diz claramente que o estupro de vulnerável é com menor de 14 anos, mas fato é que a legislação tipificava o crime de estupro pra quem tivesse conjunção carnal com menores de 14 anos. Caetano Veloso tinha 40, Paula Lavigne tinha 13. Obviamente é um crime de estupro que somente não foi adiante porque ela não representou criminalmente, e talvez a família não tenha tido acesso, enfim, por ele ser um artista ilustre do MPB, acaba-se tendo uma certa leniência com esse tipo de conduta, mas é uma atitude reprovável e é lamentável que isso venha a ser exposto na mídia desta forma porque acaba por estimular esse tipo de conduta, especialmente em um momento que a sociedade discute tanto a sexualização infantil, como a gente viu no caso do Museu do Santander Cultural, como a gente viu – recentemente – com aquele ato bizarro protagonizado em São Paulo [ele se refere ao caso da “performance La Bête], e, obviamente, a gente vê a razão da leniência de ambos com esse tipo de “arte”, se é que assim a gente pode definir”, finalizou o advogado.

1929,2,,"A Rede Globo saiu em defesa dos casos “MAM” e “Santander Cultural”, declarando guerra contra a população brasileira que se revoltou com os episódios, que envolviam crianças expostas a obras de arte voltadas para o público adulto.

Neste domingo, o Fantástico fez uma reportagem sobre o tema. No site oficial, uma matéria foi publicada com o seguinte conteúdo:

O prefeito do Rio vetou – sem consultar a opinião pública – a exposição ‘Queermuseu – Cartografias da diferença na arte brasileira’, que seria exibida no Museu de Arte do Rio, sob a acusação de que os quadros seriam impróprios por conter referências a símbolos religiosos, pedofilia e zoofilia. Antes de ser censurada no Rio, a exposição foi cancelada em Porto Alegre.

Em setembro, a imagem de uma menina tocando o pé do artista Wagner Schwartz, que se apresentou nu durante uma exposição no Museu de Arte Moderna de São Paulo, gerou protestos e agressões. A menina estava acompanhada pela mãe, que é cenógrafa, e na porta da sala tinha um aviso sobre cenas de nudez.

Durante séculos, grandes artistas retrataram a nudez. Nesta semana, o prestigiado Museu d’Orsay, em Paris, relançou uma campanha feita há dois anos: “Tragam seus filhos para ver gente nua”. O museu informa que o objetivo é compreender melhor as reações das crianças diante de obras de arte e motivar as crianças a irem ao museu.

O ativista Arthur Moledo do Val, do canal Mamãe Falei, rebateu a emissora em uma live no Facebook:

Era de se esperar que a Globo se juntasse aos artistas da campanha 342 Artes, que declaram que a revolta legítima do brasileiro se trata de “censura”, afinal, a maioria dos participantes desta patifaria é contratado da emissora.

Assista a matéria do Fantástico, que foi ao ar neste domingo, 08, aqui.

A matéria foi extremamente preconceituosa com todos os cidadãos conservadores e, mais ainda, usou tons de estigmatização e preconceito das pessoas conservadoras e religiosas com o objetivo de causar violência contra essas pessoas.

Se você for conservador e principalmente de perfil religioso e sofrer agressão nos próximos dias, quase com certeza será por causa desta matéria do Fantástico.

O nível de desinformação praticado pela Globo foi tanto que é enoja qualquer ser humano que não é um psicopata. Clique aqui para ver a que ponto chegaram os ataques da Globo.

Um comentarista disse o seguinte:

O fato é que a Globo entendeu que perdeu essa batalha, principalmente após o surgimento da campanha #SomosTodosDonaRegina.

Foi daí que eles visualizaram a única chance na criação de matérias que gerem violência contra pessoas conservadoras e religiosas. Estão com sede de sangue. Tudo porque não arredam o pé de querer expor crianças à nudez e usar a Lei Rouanet.

Nos Estados Unidos, diversos eleitores de Trump foram agredidos porque a mídia executou uma campanha exatamente desse jeito contra a direita.

Agora é hora de reagir, pois a Globo oficializou que está em campanha de ódio contra o povo conservador do Brasil. Diante de tamanha campanha de violência (que significa que a Globo foi para o tudo ou nada), só o boicote a todos os anunciantes do Fantástico serve como parte da solução.

De acordo com informações do jornal espanhol 'As', a não-assinatura definitiva de sua renovação até 2021, como anunciado em julho deste ano, está deixando um mal-estar dentro do clube catalão, causando grande preocupação de que o camisa 10 não renove conforme o esperado.

Porém, nos lados do Manchester City o clima é de esperança. Ainda segundo a publicação, os dirigentes dos Cityzens apenas aguardam uma posição de Messi de não renovar para dar o passo seguinte, que é oferecer pagar a multa recorde de 400 milhões de euros (equivalente a R$1,4 bilhão) para ter o cinco vezes melhor jogador do mundo.

Vale lembrar que, apesar de respeitar o Barcelona, sempre foi um desejo de Pep Guardiola trabalhar novamente com Messi, com quem ganhou duas Ligas dos Campeões, tanto que, quando Messi ameaçou sair do Barcelona após ser condenado por sonegação de impostos pelo Fisco Espanhol, o City era o destino esperado para o craque.

1937,2,,"por Roger Scar – Texto originalmente publicado em Guerra Política

“Não preciso de provas para matar um homem. Preciso de provas acerca da necessidade de matá-lo.” (Che Guevara – apud ORTEGA, 1970, p.179)

Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara é o símbolo da Revolução Cubana e, mais do que isso, é também símbolo para grande parte dos revolucionários da América Latina. É comum ver pessoas de todas as idades e classes – sobretudo das classes média e alta – idolatrando o ícone da esquerda vanguardista. Muitos o fazem por ilusão, sem saber quem realmente ele foi. Outros tantos o fazem apesar de saberem de tudo o que ele fez. Este artigo servirá para dividir os grupos. Aqueles que terminarem a leitura e continuarem tratando este defunto como herói certamente não são boa gente.

Guevara matou pelo menos uma criança (a sangue frio)

Muitos defensores do revolucionário propagam a ideia de que é preciso quebrar alguns ovos para se fazer a omelete, referindo-se sempre aos crimes cometidos pelos seus ídolos, como Che Guevara. No entanto, de modo geral é aceito, facilmente, que não existem justificativas plausíveis para se matar uma criança, ainda mais quando se é um adulto armado e forte diante de um menino completamente indefeso.

Assim mesmo, em dezembro de 1959, segundo relato de Pierre San Martin, um menino que tinha entre 12 e 14 anos foi executado com um tiro atrás da cabeça. O carrasco foi o próprio Che Guevara, que o matou diante de vários prisioneiros. O “crime” que o jovem cometeu, no caso, foi ter lutado para defender seus pais do paredão. Que tipo de herói assassinaria uma criança assim, de forma tão fria e covarde? Nenhum, é claro.

Para Che, matar em nome da revolução era totalmente aceitável

O revolucionário latino nunca escondeu seu lado sanguinário. Para ele, matar em nome da revolução era apenas ofício, era como cozinhar ou lavar o carro. Isso fazia parte de seu cotidiano e, diga-se, o próprio confessou que tinha desejo de matar desde quando ainda era muito jovem, e chegou a dizer isso em carta escrita a seu próprio pai. A verdade é que todo o histórico de Che leva a crer que ele fosse apenas um psicopata, e que usou a revolução como caminho para fazer algo que sempre quis fazer: matar pessoas.

Em 1964, perante a Assembleia Geral da ONU, o mesmo afirmou categoricamente que o Regime Cubano fuzilava seus inimigos e continuaria fuzilando. Como já foi dito, ele nunca tentou esconder seu lado assassino.

Che Guevara era favorável a aumentar a tensão durante a crise dos mísseis em Cuba

Pode até parecer óbvio, mas Che defendeu que o governo cubano aumentasse a tensão entre URSS e EUA durante a crise dos mísseis, a fim de que a guerra de fato acontecesse. Em apoio a ideia, ele disse: “O que devemos é continuar no longo caminho da libertação, mesmo que isso custe milhões de vidas atômicas.”

Che Guevara se orgulhava de executar pessoas sem evidência criminal alguma

“Para mandar homens para o pelotão de fuzilamento, não é necessário nenhuma prova judicial. Estes procedimentos são um detalhe arcaico burguês. Esta é uma revolução!”

O símbolo dos jovens revolucionários de hoje era o carrasco sanguinário e déspota de ontem. Ernesto admitiu inúmeras vezes que executava pessoas pela mera suspeita de qualquer crime, e até mesmo sua definição de crime era muito vaga, pois para ele a discordância ideológica era suficiente. Uma de suas frases mais célebres é, justamente, a que diz que para matar um homem basta que ele elogie o governo anterior.

Usando o pretexto revolucionário, Che Guevara abandonou cinco filhos e uma esposa

Perto dos itens anteriores, este aqui é bem leve, mas ainda assim é necessário, pois reforça o lado desumano de alguém que é visto como um herói por milhares de pessoas.

Che se casou duas vezes, e com sua primeira esposa teve apenas um filho. Com a segunda esposa, Aleida March, ele teve mais quatro. Todos ficaram para trás quando o revolucionário partiu em sua missão, que basicamente consistiu em matar tanta gente quanto foi possível.

De acordo com o historiador cubano Humberto Fontova, o revolucionário argentino chegou a planejar, junto às suas tropas, um ataque com bombas em alvos civis na cidade de Nova York. A finalidade do ataque não se sabe ao certo, mas suspeita-se que tinha como meta a retaliação americana. Aparentemente, após o fracasso da crise dos mísseis, Che buscou outras maneiras de provocar o governo americano e forçar uma guerra.

Vale informar que, para seus objetivos, um ataque americano em solo cubano seria uma ferramenta política muito útil, visto que serviria para justificar um contra-ataque soviético e dar continuidade ao seu projeto de poder de instaurar uma nação stalinista em toda a América Latina.

Zoé Valdés, escritora cubana, lamentou muito as homenagens prestadas a Che Guevara pelo mundo. Ela expôs sua insatisfação durante o fórum “Cuba, Revolução e Homossexualidade”, realizado em Madrid, em 2008.

Em seu livro “O Socialismo e o Homem em Cuba”, Guevara propunha um modelo fascista de “novo homem”, apelando para a virilidade e excluindo homossexuais e transgêneros. O apelo à heterossexualidade era tão forte que, estima-se, ele matou pelo menos algumas dezenas de homossexuais. Esta prática, que foi iniciada por ele, continuou depois. O Regime Cubano, nas mãos de Fidel, foi um dos mais cruéis com os homossexuais em toda a história do ocidente.

Por Redação                        | 06 de Outubro de 2017 às 07h26

Você, usuário de iPhone, sabia que a Uber pode visualizar a tela do seu smartphone, mesmo com o aplicativo rodando em segundo plano? Foi o que pesquisadores de segurança descobriram. Após a revelação, a Uber disse que a funcionalidade que permitia essa espionagem não está mais em uso e será removida do app após uma atualização. Isso era possível graças a uma permissão chamada ""entitlement"", que faz parte do código do aplicativo para iOS. Ela é necessária para que apps consigam configurar notificações push e interagir com outros serviços, como o iCloud ou Apple Pay. No caso do Uber, o recurso era usado para melhorar o gerenciamento de memória para o Apple Watch. Segundo Luca Todesco, pesquisador e jailbreaker de iPhones, ""isso pode potencialmente roubar senhas"", já que hackers que conseguissem invadir a rede do Uber poderiam silenciosamente monitorar a atividade da tela do usuário. Por exemplo, se o usuário, ao estar com o app da Uber em segundo plano, decidir instalar um outro aplicativo que exija login e senha. Caso seu aparelho estivesse sendo monitorado naquele momento, essas informações pessoais estariam vulneráveis. A Uber, por sua vez, explicou que o recurso ""foi usado para uma versão antiga do aplicativo para o Apple Watch, especificamente para executar o levantamento pesado de mapas de renderização no celular e então enviá-los ao app no Watch"", já que os primeiros modelos do smartwatch da Maçã não eram capazes de lidar com esses processos sozinhos. Mas, ainda segundo a companhia, ""essa dependência foi removida com melhorias anteriores ao sistema operacional da Apple e ao nosso aplicativo; portanto, estamos removendo essa API de nossa base de códigos para iOS"".

1945,1,,"Existem muitas histórias por trás de “Blade Runner”, ficção científica de Ridley Scott que completa 35 anos e acaba de ganhar sua primeira continuação pelas mãos de Denis Villeneuve. As origens no livro de Philip K. Dick, a produção conturbada, os retornos do diretor ao material nas décadas seguintes e a mudança de percepção do público do lançamento aos dias de hoje rendem todo tipo de análise a cada nova menção ao título do filme. O documentário “On The Edge of Blade Runner”, realizado pelo crítico Mark Kermode em 2000, é uma dessas reações preocupadas com todo e qualquer detalhe possível.

O aspecto mais interessante do making of é perceber como o culto ao redor do longa se formou e quais foram as bases para que ele tivesse tanto impacto no gênero e na cultura pop — culminando, tanto tempo depois, em “Blade Runner 2049”. Dentre os fatores que contribuem para essa longevidade está a obsessão de Scott pela própria obra. É verdade que o comando foi passado adiante nessa continuação, mas por décadas o cineasta inglês alimentou o mito ao redor dos replicantes por meio de novos cortes, finais alterados e uma grande disposição para debater o assunto.

Durante o período em que ele esteve debruçado sobre os destinos de Deckard (Harrison Ford) e Rachael (Sean Young), no entanto, nenhum dos produtos mais claramente influenciados pelo filme investiu de maneira tão determinada nesse tipo de ambientação num mundo de androides quanto Villeneuve faz agora. Nesse sentido, quem aguardou anos para passar mais tempo nessa versão distópica de Los Angeles finalmente tem a oportunidade certa, uma vez que a dedicação ao universo estabelecido em 1982 transparece em cada segundo das quase três horas de duração do longa.

No que diz respeito aos reflexos dessa proposta na prática, os resultados variam. Embora não siga à risca os moldes da maior parte das continuações de Hollywood, “BR2049” também é maior e mais inchado que seu antecessor. No roteiro, escrito por Hampton Fancher e Michael Green, os personagens e as subtramas se multiplicam, levando o novo protagonista, o blade runner K (Ryan Gosling), a explorar uma dúzia de cenários diferentes em busca de pistas. A trama de investigação não é necessariamente empolgante, em parte porque os acontecimentos se encadeiam de forma mecânica, por um bom tempo saltando de situação em situação sem provocar grandes surpresas ou mergulhar nas intrigas que cria — a ação só engrena realmente no terço final do filme.

A maneira como os eventos são conduzidos também tem relação com o desenrolar irregular da trama principal. Outra característica do original intensificada na continuação, o ritmo pausado transporta o espectador para aquele mundo sem manual de instruções, numa abordagem que dá enorme valor à ambientação. Contudo, o diretor frequentemente pesa a mão e exagera na lentidão, como se insistisse em recuar nos momentos decisivos a despeito da urgência que certos personagens (como os de Jared Leto e Robin Wright), com seus discursos, e a trilha sonora de Hans Zimmer, com suas entradas grandiosas, impõem à narrativa.

1947,3,1.0,"Ever since the EM drive first made headlines, science lovers have puzzled over how the propulsion system seems to produce thrust, despite the fact it's 'impossible' according to one of the most fundamental laws of physics - Newton's third law of motion.

Now a team of physicists have put forward an alternative explanation - it turns out the EM drive could actually work without breaking any scientific laws, if we factor in a weird and often overlooked idea in quantum physics - pilot wave theory.

For those who need a refresher, the crux of the problem here is that the EM, or electromagnetic, drive appears to produce thrust without any fuel or propellant.

That's awesome because it means we can get to space with way less pay load - it's proposed it could even get us to Mars within 72 days.

But it's also perplexing, because, according to Newton's third law, every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. So without pushing any propellant out one end, the drive shouldn't be able to produce thrust in the opposite direction.

Still, as a NASA peer-reviewed paper showed last year, the drive does produce thrust, at least as far as we can currently tell. And a relatively large amount of thrust at that. We just don't know how.

So either our understanding of physics isn't right, or we're missing a big piece of the puzzle when it comes to the EM drive.

A new paper published in The Journal of Applied Physical Science International makes the argument that what we're missing is pilot wave theory - a slightly controversial alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Researchers José Croca and Paulo Castro from the Centre for Philosophy of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in Portugal suggest that not only could pilot wave theory explain the mysterious behaviour of the EM drive, it could help to make it even more powerful.

""We have found that applying a pilot wave theory to NASA's EM drive frustum [or cone], we could explain its thrust without involving any external action applied to the system, as Newton's third law would require,"" Castro told ScienceAlert via email.

So what is pilot wave theory? Currently, the majority of physicists subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which states that particles do not have defined locations until they are observed.

Pilot wave theory, on the other hand, suggests that particles do have precise positions at all times, but in order for this to be the case, the world must also be strange in other ways – which is why many physicists have dismissed the idea.

But in recent years, the pilot wave theory has been increasing in popularity. The team has shown in its latest paper this theory could be tweaked slightly to apply to something bigger. Say, the EM drive. And it could explain the results we've been seeing.

Basically, pilot wave theory says that an object radiates a wave field, and it is then pulled or attracted to regions of that field that have higher intensity or energy density. In that way, the wave field is actually 'piloting' the object, hence the name.

Through modelling, the team showed that a sufficiently strong and asymmetrical electromagnetic field could act as a pilot wave. And that's exactly what the EM drive generates.

Because the cone, or frustum, of the EM drive is asymmetrical, it would also generate an asymmetrical wave field. As a result, the walls of the EM drive would move towards the areas of higher intensity, creating thrust.

While that might sound pretty out there, this was also actually a possible solution put forward by the NASA Eagleworks researchers in their seminal paper last year where they first reported the thrust generated by their device:

""[The] supporting physics model used to derive a force based on operating conditions in the test article can be categorised as a nonlocal hidden-variable theory, or pilot-wave theory for short.""

To be clear, the researchers from the University of Lisbon haven't tested their proposal in a real device as yet.

They've only shown that it's possible, from a modelling point of view, for a pilot wave to guide the EM drive. But they've also shown how the idea could actually be tested in future.

""At the moment the most stringent empirical evidence comes from the EM drive behaviour,"" Castro told ScienceAlert. ""However, we have also devised an experiment to detect and modulate subquantum waves.""

Importantly, if the hypothesis is confirmed, it would mean the EM drive would not have to break Newton's third law. And the team hopes this might result in the device being taken seriously and more widely tested.

""EM drive is the future of space propelling motors,"" they said. ""[Although] it will perhaps find its initial application in nano satellites or nano drones, at least before the effect can be scaled up to heavier machines.""

Importantly, if a pilot wave does explain the thrust behind the device, then it could also lead to a way to make the propulsion system even more powerful in future, and it's as simple as tweaking the shape.

""We have seen that the effect could be enhanced using a different shape for the frustum,"" said Castro. ""In fact a trumpet exponential form is expected to increase the thrust.""

The team is now considering building its own experimental set up to study the phenomena and has invited anyone interested in the project to get in touch.

In the meantime, the NASA Eagleworks team continues to test out its device. And there are also groups looking to test the EM drive in space - or according to some rumours, already doing so - which would really show once and for all whether it works.

There's a lot we have yet to learn about the mysterious EM drive and it's a topic that continues to divide the science world. But whether or not it ends up being the future of space travel, at least it's teaching us more about the physics that govern our world.

The new research has been published in The Journal of Applied Physical Science International.

O destaque fica para a energia solar, que teve o maior crescimento de todas as modalidades, com adição líquida de 74 GW no ano passado. O relatório diz que isso se deve ao barateamento da tecnologia, e ao suporte de políticas governamentais. Grande parte dessa ajuda vem da China, responsável por 40% do crescimento global do setor renovável; metade dos novos painéis fotovoltaicos no mundo foram instalados lá.

Os chineses colocaram para funcionar em maio a maior usina solar flutuante do mundo, que gera 40 MW. É uma aposta que faz sentido: Pequim tem um nível de poluição do ar 20 vezes maior que o recomendado pela OMS. A China gera hoje 77 gigawatts de energia solar, e quer complementar isso com 110 GW até 2020, investindo US$ 360 bilhões no setor. Não é pouca coisa!

A IEA acredita que, até 2022, o setor renovável pode crescer 43% no mundo todo, acumulando 920 GW. Nestes cinco anos, a potência de energia solar da Índia tende a dobrar e passar toda a capacidade da União Europeia.

Deste lado do mundo, nem tudo são flores: os Estados Unidos continuam em segundo lugar na lista dos países em que a energia renovável mais cresce, mas as exportações de carvão aumentaram 60% no país. Políticas recentes do país de movimentar essa indústria podem colocar a posição dos EUA no ranking em risco, segundo o relatório.

No Brasil, a concentração de energia solar ainda é pequena. Segundo a Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), os painéis solares do país geram 28 MW, o que representa apenas 0,02% da nossa matriz energética.

Além do look extraordinário, talvez o maior mérito de Villeneuve em Blade Runner 2049 tenha sido o de apresentar um universo que homenageia e protege o rico legado deixado pelo original, ao mesmo tempo em que demonstra personalidade própria e expande as ideias e temas propostos por Blade Runner.

Em comparação, Harrison Ford, que só aparece no ato final para amarrar a trama e fazer a ponte definitiva com o Blade Runner original, ao reprisar o papel do agente Deckard, consegue ter muito mais presença e efetividade contracenando com Ryan Gosling.

Esse último que, por sinal, entrega uma performance ao mesmo tempo contida e vulnerável, retratando com propriedade o sentimento de um agente sem alma, confuso em relação ao seu passado e descrente com suas obrigações do presente.

E, se o Blade Runner original apresentava uma história enxuta e primava pela sutileza com que sugeria os temas abordados em seu universo, o filme atual perde um pouco do foco com a quantidade de metáforas bíblicas e questões filosóficas. Fala de forma superficial sobre livre-arbítrio, alma, alienação, etc.

JL: Como mulher e mãe, quais foram suas impressões ao assistir pela primeira vez ao vídeo da performance que ocorreu na abertura do 35 Panorama da Arte Brasileira do MAM-SP?

Indignação, por não ter uma autoridade, um adulto consciente naquele lugar, capaz de impedir aquele abuso. Segundo o estatuto da criança do adolescente e as  leis brasileiras, aquela menina foi exposta  a situação vexatória, a conteúdos sexuais, a nudez de um adulto desconhecido, abusada  psicologicamente, exposta a um situação de risco, usada como objeto de prazer dos adultos a sua volta que regozijavam com a real possibilidade  de uma criança  poder tocar um corpo  nu de um adulto, quiseram naturalizar este ato, este comportamento degradante, ali foi claramente trazido a discussão de aceitação social da pedofilia…

JL: O principal ponto que está sendo debatido em torno desta polêmica do MAM/SP é que tipo de efeitos psicológicos a exposição de uma criança a um adulto estranho e nu, nos primeiros anos de infância, como se fosse algo natural, e, ainda por cima, com o incentivo da mãe – que seria a autoridade máxima ao filho nesta idade -, enfim, este tipo de ação pode gerar quais impactos na criança?

O abuso sexual é um tema que choca. É um ato  desumano que traz feridas profundas, porém muitas vezes ‘invisíveis’ aos olhos dos terapeutas. As vítimas de abuso sexual, de exposição a conteúdos eróticos, ficam marcadas pelo resto de suas vidas por esta ação destrutiva, o que inevitavelmente traz consequências muito sérias para seu desenvolvimento emocional e para seus relacionamentos futuros

Muitos sintomas aparecem ainda na infâncias como: problemas de sono, pesadelos, medo, insegurança, tristeza, depressão, comportamentos agressivos – por não entender, e não saber expressar o que sentem –  compulsão por masturbação, interesse precoce por sexo (erotização infantil) e novos ao longo da adolescência e vida adulta, tais como drogadição, transtornos alimentares e distúrbios de personalidade, estas são consideradas tentativas mal adaptadas de se lidar com o trauma do abuso e com as memórias conscientes ou não que tendem a vir à tona mais facilmente diante do estabelecimento de relacionamentos íntimos e sexuais na vida adulta.

Crianças, quando exposta com anuência de um dos genitores, correm ainda um grande risco de achar natural, ou seja, se um adulto lhes tocar ou pedir para ser tocado, sua memória oferecerá a cena onde foi exposta com a segurança da presença dos pais e poderá ceder ao abusador, por achar que é ” normal” com o passar do tempo, colocará juízo de valor e começara todo seu tormento psicológico, quando ela entender que foi abusada entrara em processos que podem se tornar agressivos a ela ( a criança) e a terceiros.

JL: Um dos argumentos levantados dentro do debate político pelos que defendem ideologias de esquerda é de que quando uma criança é, deste cedo, apresentada a sexualidade como algo natural, o sexo deixa de ser um tabu e isso seria algo positivo para o desenvolvimento mental da pessoa, alguns utilizam até mesmo os índios como exemplo. Já os conservadores condenam a ideia e acreditam que a exposição de uma criança a sexualidade na infância pode causar a erotização, despertando a curiosidade da criança, e abrir caminho para que a prática da pedofilia seja, em breve, aceita na sociedade. Primeiro, tem cabimento a comparação de que “na cultura indígena é normal”? Como a psicologia trata esta questão? Afinal, a sexualidade apresentada na infância influência de forma positiva ou negativa?

A verdade é que os índios quando civilizados lutam contra o abuso sexual infantil, entendem como violência contra a criança, ninguém aceita ser abusado, só uma pessoa concorda com essa afirmação – os pedófilos, abusadores – . Todo ser humano deve repudiar qualquer tipo de abuso infantil. Existem algumas  tribos distantes da civilização que tem relação sexual com crianças, que já reproduzem, para garantir a propagação da espécie.  É descabida esta comparação, ela é usada pelos pedófilos de todo mundo que estão em campanha para tornar a pedofilia um ato de “amor”. Muitas perversões sexuais existem e sempre existiram em diversas culturas e são rechaçadas por toda sociedade que promove o respeito à dignidade humana, quem usa estes argumentos vá morar nestas tribos então, vá se tratar pois só pode ser um pedófilo tentando normalizar a pedofilia através da aceitação social dessa perversão doentia sexual.

JL: Existe um esforço para que a pedofilia passe a ser encarada como uma doença dentro do campo acadêmico da psicologia? O interesse por este tema está crescendo?

Pedofilia é reconhecida como parafilia, como distúrbio sexual em todos os compêndios de psiquiatria, porém a organização mundial de saúde e a associação americana de psiquiatria têm recomendado que a pedofilia seja entendida como orientação sexual parafílica. Ou seja, uma orientação sexual patológica.  O perigo disso é que, sendo uma orientação sexual reconhecida, muitos podem  defender a pedofilia como uma orientação sexual embora pedofilica como um direito e lutar pela sua naturalização como já acontece em cerca de quinze países pelo mundo. Podemos citar o Canadá onde existe até projeto de lei defendendo o pedófilo e um movimento para tratar com humanidade os pedófilos pois segundo esses defensores “pedófilos são apenas homens que amam crianças”. Quanto a psicologia brasileira, infelizmente até esta data não se manifestou sobre a exposição de crianças em performances de “arte”, deixando profissionais apreensivos e indignados em todo Brasil. Nos questionamos o que pode ser mais importante do que defender nossas crianças contra abusos dessa natureza, talvez o CFP (Conselho Federal de Psicologia) não considere esse tipo de exposição abusiva, o que seria um acinte. Estamos aguardando manifestação do CFP e condenando seu silêncio.

JL: Pensando sobre o comportamento dos movimentos sociais e ações políticas, com a polarização cada vez maior em torno dos temas controversos, você concorda que os que se colocam à esquerda têm aumentado cada vez mais a perseguição aos liberais-conservadores justamente por causa das contestações que os que se colocam à direita tem feito, por todos os meios, as pautas partidárias de esquerda?

As pautas da esquerda são oportunistas, burras e abusivas. Os tais esquerdistas seguem cegamente seus líderes e ídolos sem questionar. Pura alienação, viraram escravos dessa doença, dessa droga chamada esquerda. Perderam o poder de decisão, não desenvolvem mais censo crítico. A esquerda se associa a qualquer aberração apenas para ser do contra e perseguir seus desafetos, ainda que essa associação seja a um tema tão degradante como de exposição de crianças a pedofilia, zoofilia. Essa é a verdadeira face dessa esquerda, batem no peito se dizendo defensores dos direitos humanos e negligenciam os cuidados mais primários com crianças enquanto se ocupam de pautas que só desconstroem valores famílias e infância.

Estamos vivendo uma guerra ideológica, de valores morais, inclusive política, é fato. Mas a esquerda está totalmente doente, confundindo lutas por direitos com pornografia, abuso sexual infantil, orgias, pedofilia, zoofilia, etc. Confundindo direitos humanos com direitos a ofender e odiar a fé alheia e seus opositores. A estratégia dos pós modernidade é as artes, que tem liberdade constitucional e tem sido confundida com escarnio da moral e perseguição religiosa bem como com meio a introduzir toda e qualquer perversão sem que se note, sem que se puna.  Tudo o que eles dizem condenar na Direita é o que eles são e fazem. Somos a projeção esquizofrênica de uma esquerda idiotizada. Se ao menos conseguissem questionar os abusos, não seriam tão esquizoides.

JL: Há quem defenda que existe um movimento pró-pedofilia que visa primeiro desgastar o termo “pedofilia” e emplacar a ideia de “amor intergeracional”, buscando a aceitação da sociedade da conduta pedófila. Primeiro, tirar-se-ia a responsabilidade do sujeito, pois ele, teoricamente, não teria culpa de sentir atração por crianças, e a consequência disto seria a prática ser aceita com o tempo. A ideia de “amor intergeracional” e de que a atração por crianças é algo biológico, e não patológico, é algo que está sendo debatido academicamente?

Cabe aqui frisar que nem sempre o abuso sexual envolve violência física. Sempre que uma parte induz a outra a aceitar ou ao menos não se opor a um ato sexualizado pelo convencimento no qual utiliza seu poder na relação, já se caracteriza um abuso. Outra situação de indução pode ocorrer através da sedução. Faiman (2004) define a sedução como sendo abusiva quando envolve uma interação em que uma pessoa estimula sentimentos e sensações sexuais na outra, que consente com o ato, pois também se encontra sexualmente estimulada, no entanto em um tipo de relacionamento em que “a erotização do vínculo consiste no próprio abuso” (p. 28). Uma mãe que erotiza seu vínculo com o filho, por ex., mesmo que através de um olhar, está sendo abusiva.

Temos que deixar claro que quem defende pedofilia, toques em crianças, são doentes sexuais, pedófilos, perversos psicopatas e devem ser punidos. Não podemos aceitar que essa ARTE QUEER, seja tratada como normal, como aceitável, pois não é. Todos os escritores que tentam suavizar a pedofilia são tão perversos quanto. Temos que endurecer nossas críticas a esses que tentam suavizar justamente para que a sociedade comece a aceitar socialmente a discussão da pedofilia como um direito da criança e do adulto. Notem que cada vez mais, tem acontecido situações que expõe as crianças, e a mídia tem sido conivente com essas exposições, isso tudo acaba contribuindo com a aceitação social da pedofilia. Grupos internacionais de pedófilos tem patrocinado em todo mundo estratégias de promover essa aceitação. Jornalistas, artistas, deputados… eles estão defendendo o indefensável.

Mas a estratégia maior é desconstruir seus opositores, desmoralizar para que estes, percam força. Como no caso do MBL, que tem sido sistematicamente desconstruído para que as denúncias percam força. Não funciona, pois estão mexendo com a inocência das crianças e o Brasil repudiou e repudia, e quanto mais tentarem destruir os defensores da infância e da família mais cresceremos.

Não podemos nos calar diante dessa desconstrução da infância da destruição da inocência das nossas crianças, temos a obrigação como sociedade, profissionais, parlamentares, movimentos de rua ou sociais conscientes, de lutar contra e não banalizar a perversão. Pedofilia não é arte, criança não é brinquedo, criança não é adulto, não somos alienados ou psicopatas sexuais, o mínimo que precisamos saber para não cairmos nessa armadilha é que defender a criança é um ato de sanidade mental, crianças não podem em hipótese alguma serem usada como objeto sexual para satisfazerem adultos em quaisquer situação. Quando um adulto perverso vê uma criança tocando em um homem pelado, ele vai cometer um crime sexual, pois pode desencadernar neste perverso sexual, uma compulsão que só vai cessar quando encontrar mais uma vítima.

Quem defende essa exposição QUEER MUSEU e quem defende peças de teatro com crianças tocando adultos tem que repensar seus valores, pois pode estar sendo um idiota útil, um analfabeto funcional usado para fazer caminha a agenda subversiva, esquerdista da teoria Queer que visa sistematicamente a reorientação sexual da humanidade, tem como objetivo construir uma sexualidade universal ideal sonhada POLOFORMICAMENTE PERVERSA. Não podemos aliviar o discurso, tudo tem limite, a esquerda já ultrapassou todo e qualquer limite. Basta.

1966,1,,"O IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) revisou cálculos do PIB (Produto Interno Bruto) e, com isso, vários resultados passados foram alterados --a maioria para cima. A mudança só afetou os números que comparam um trimestre com o período imediatamente anterior.

No quarto trimestre de 2016, por exemplo, a queda passou de 0,9% para 0,5%. No terceiro, foi de -0,7% para -0,6%.

O instituto divulgou, nesta quinta-feira (1º) que a economia brasileira cresceu 1% no primeiro trimestre deste ano, mas encolheu 0,4% na comparação com 2016.

As mudanças foram feitas no cálculo do desempenho do setor de serviços e nas vendas do comércio. O peso de alguns subsetores mudou, e a base de comparação das pesquisas mensais passou de 2011 para 2014.

Em abril, quando foram divulgados os primeiros números de comércio e serviços sob o novo cálculo, referentes a fevereiro, o IBGE divulgou também dados revisados para janeiro.

Assim, o comércio passou de queda de 0,7% e relação a dezembro para alta de 5,5%. O setor de serviços passou de queda de 2,2% para alta de 0,2%.

Na época, quando questionado sobre uma possível influência do governo para melhorar dados, o então diretor do IBGE, Roberto Olinto, negou a interferência, e afirmou que a mudança foi técnica. Olinto será o novo presidente do IBGE, após a ida de Paulo Rabello de Castro para a presidência do BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social).

O IBGE divulgou afirmando que ""não mudou a metodologia para calcular o PIB.""

""Não foram feitas revisões de dados na série. O que mudou (como muda todo trimestre) foi o ajuste sazonal dos dados. As séries com ajuste sazonal das Contas Nacionais Trimestrais são integralmente revistas a cada trimestre. Isso porque todo trimestre tem um padrão sazonal que impede comparações diretas com o trimestre imediatamente anterior.""

""Assim, para poder comparar trimestres consecutivos, o IBGE produz séries com ajuste sazonal, quer dizer, séries que descontam o padrão típico de cada trimestre e permitem comparar trimestres sucessivos e estimar o crescimento entre eles. Isso significa que toda vez que um dado é incluído na série comparável ao trimestre imediatamente anterior, toda a série já divulgada é revista para que a sazonalidade seja redistribuída.""

1967,1,,"O feito era do laborat�rio H. H. Wills, da Universidade de Bristol, onde Lattes havia chegado no in�cio de 1946 a convite de Giuseppe Occhialini (1907-1993), que fora seu professor na USP, e Cecil Powell (1903-1969), chefe do grupo.

Lattes p�de p�r em pr�tica um plano que havia tra�ado ainda no Brasil. Ele queria usar as chapas para estudar os raios c�smicos, n�cleos at�micos que, a todo instante, penetram a Terra e, chocando-se com mol�culas da atmosfera, geram uma chuveirada de part�culas.

A esperan�a dos f�sicos era a de que um desses nacos de mat�ria fosse uma part�cula ainda desconhecida. Para melhorar as chances dessa ""captura"", as chapas eram expostas em montanhas. No final de 1946, Lattes pediu a Occhialini que deixasse algumas caixas delas no Pic du Midi, nos Pirineus franceses (2.500 m de altitude).

Entusiasmado, Lattes apostou que, no monte Chacaltaya, na Bol�via, com o dobro da altura do Pic du Midi, ele poderia capturar mais m�sons pi. O laborat�rio H. H. Wills pagou a passagem at� o Rio de Janeiro e, de l�, o brasileiro se viraria para chegar ao seu destino. Montanhas, neve, cavernas, fundos de lago etc. F�sica experimental tinha algo de aventura � �poca.

Ao final daquele ano, o H. H. Wills ganhava ares de meca da t�cnica fotogr�fica aplicada � f�sica. As not�cias da detec��o do m�son pi espalharam-se. Do norte da Europa, veio o convite para Lattes dar palestras.

Em Copenhague, o jovem brasileiro encontrou-se com Niels Bohr (1885-1962), Nobel de F�sica de 1922. O dinamarqu�s ficou surpreso ao saber que Lattes pretendia deixar Bristol e seguir para os EUA. Sua miss�o seria detectar m�sons no ent�o mais potente acelerador de part�culas do mundo, o sincrocicl�tron de 184 polegadas, na Universidade da Calif�rnia (Berkeley).

Lattes chegou no in�cio de 1948 e, dez dias depois, com a ajuda do colega norte-americano Eugene Gardner (1913-1950), visualizou os m�sons nas chapas fotogr�ficas expostas ao feixe de part�culas gerado por aquele equipamento.

A produ��o artificial do m�son pi foi capa da revista ""Science News Times"", ocupou p�ginas de duas edi��es da revista ""Time"", mereceu entrevista coletiva com cobertura da ""Nucleonics"" e rendeu reportagens no jornal ""The New York Times"", cuja editoria de ci�ncia elegeu aquele o feito mais importante da f�sica no ano, comparando-o � fiss�o do n�cleo at�mico.

Para o Brasil, o m�son foi muito mais do que uma part�cula, e Lattes, muito mais do que ele mesmo. Seus feitos impulsionaram a constru��o da estrutura pol�tico-administrativa de ci�ncia no pa�s.

Lattes poderia ter feito carreira no exterior, mas optou por seu pa�s. ""Prefiro ajudar a construir a ci�ncia no Brasil do que ganhar um Nobel"", escreveu, na d�cada de 1940, ao colega f�sico Jos� Leite Lopes (1918-2006).

Por Por Felipe Vinha e Carolina Ochsendorf, para o TechTudo            Victor Hugo é um dos mais renomados poetas e escritores francês e também o tema do Doodle do Google desta sexta-feira, 30 de junho. A homenagem do gigante de buscas comemora 155 anos da publicação do livro ""Les Misérables”, ou “Os Miseráveis”, cujo capítulo final data do ano de 1862. O Doodle vem em formato de slideshow e destaca outras obras famosas, como ""O Concunda da Notre-Dame"" (1831) e a coletânea de poesias ""As Contemplações"" (1856).     Sites que permitem baixar livros em PDF de forma gratuita               A obra ""Os Miseráveis"" no Doodle de Victor Hugo (Foto: Reprodução/Felipe Vinha)         Victor Hugo nasceu em 26 de fevereiro de 1802, em Paris. O terceiro filho do casal Sophie Trébuchet e Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo, Victor-Marie Hugo. Escritor precoce, recebeu seu primeiro prêmio da Academia Francesa aos 15 anos por um de seus poemas. O autor também ficou famoso por suas frases icônicas como “Ser bom é fácil. O difícil é ser justo” e outras.     O autor, além de poeta e escritor, ficou conhecido também por trabalhos na dramaturgia e por ter sido um dos grandes ativistas dos direitos humanos na França. Por conta de visões políticas fortes e sua atuação em destaque nesse campo, Victor Hugo foi exilado por quase 10 anos ─ inclusive durante a publicação de “Os Miseráveis”. Opositor de Napoleão III, o escritor teve que sair do país e buscou refúgio na Ilha de Guernsey (território inglês), na Bélgica e também no Canal da Mancha.        Apesar de já ter publicado sua coletânea de poemas (1822) e a peça teatral Marion do Lorme (1826), foi com o romance “Notre-Dame de Paris” (1831) que Victor Hugo se tornou conhecido. A obra, que deu origem aos contos do “Corcunda de Notre-Dame”, marcou o romantismo francês com as descrições da Paris medieval e seu submundo. Anos mais tarde, em 1996, a obra seria adaptada pela Disney, em um filme animado. Seu legado é tão grande que transformou a famosa Catedral de Notre-Dame, no Centro de Paris, em um dos locais mais populares da França e do mundo. Durante seu exílio, Victor Hugo produziu obras como ""Les Travailleurs de la Mer"" (Os Trabalhadores do Mar, de 1866) e ""L’Homme Qui Rit"" (O Homem que Ri, de 1869).     Conheça mais sobre as obras de Victor Hugo no Google Arts & Culture    Livro, musical e cinema: ""Os Miseráveis""    Foi a partir de 1849 que Victor Hugo dedicou sua vida à produção de obras voltadas para a política, ainda que os temas religião e filosofia também tenham sido presentes na literatura do autor, no mesmo período.     Divida em cinco volumes, a obra ""Os Miseráveis"" se passa na França do século XIX, entre a Batalha de Waterloo (1815) e os motins de junho de 1832. Nela, o personagem principal é Jean Valjean, um homem condenado por roubar um pedaço de pão que ganha a liberdade somente após 19 anos de prisão. A obra é uma crítica e denúncia das misérias sociais e falta de justiça do período. Os conflitos também fazem parte de ""Os Miseráveis"", já que os atos de Jean chamam a atenção da polícia, e do Estado.     Por conta do sucesso da publicação, o livro ganhou adaptações. Entre elas, estão o musical da Broadway, apelidado de “Les Mis” e o filme ""Os Miseráveis"", de 2012, dirigido por Tom Hooper.       A homenagem do Google conta com uma espécie de slide com desenhos das principais obras de Victor Hugo, feitos pela doodler Sophie Diao, que mostra as datas em que foram publicadas. Tendo a ilustração do autor como capa, é possível ver também a representação de “Notre-Dame de Paris” (1831), ""As Contemplações (1856)"" e, por fim, ""Os Miseráveis"" (1956) no Doodle.       Victor Hugo morreu em maio de 1885, aos 83 anos, em Paris. O autor retornou a sua cidade Natal após a queda do Segundo Império. Seu enterro, por outro lado, foi realizado somente em 1º de junho, no qual mais de dois milhões de pessoas puderam acompanhar o cortejo do seu corpo. Seus restos mortais foram depositados no monumento Panteão de Paris, em Santa Genoveva.     Hoje, ruas e locais de Paris levam seu nome, além de um museu, ""Maison de Victor Hugo"", local da antiga casa do escritor, na França. O autor também teve pelo menos 17 obras publicadas após sua morte, de conhecimento geral, entre livros e poemas, como ""Dieu"" (1891) e, a mais recente, ""Pierres"" (1951). Dos poemas mais famosos, ""Desejos"", inspirou outros poetas, é o mais famoso.

1969,1,,"Um relatório do Tribunal de Contas da União  escancarou diversos problemas do ""legado olímpico"" deixado à cidade do Rio de Janeiro.

Entre eles, são mencionados piscinas nos parques do Rio 2016 com fezes de capivaras, bombas d'água em processo de deterioração, promessas de 12 mil árvores que jamais saiu do papel e abandono das arenas.

Confederação levou R$ 236 milhões para investir no esporte, mas aplicou quase tudo na poupança e não usou

Com R$ 1,8 bilhão do Esporte sem prestações de contas, documentos indicam fraudes e privilégios a cartolas

A auditoria foi feita pelo TCU como plano de contingência para evitar a degradação das arenas olímpicas e cobrar a apresentação de um plano efetivo de destinação das instalações do Rio 2016 após um ano do término dos Jogos.

Também foram incluídas determinações e recomendações à AGLO (Autoridade de Governança do Legado Olímpico), à prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro e ao comando do exército.

O relatório de 48 páginas, em determinado momento, cita que as piscinas do Complexo de Deodoro ""contém lodo no fundo e nas bordas, além de sujeiras, pequenos insetos, aranhas e coliformes fecais de capivaras"".

Nesse sentido, é cobrada a imediata contratação de serviços de limpeza, segurança, manutenção e operação especializada das instalações e equipamentos existentes no Parque Radical, de forma prévia ao uso pela população.

Isso, porque a AGLO sugere transformar o local no segundo maior parque de lazer da cidade, atrás apenas do Parque do Flamengo. A ideia é manter a pista de BMX e a Canoagem Slalom, mas desativar a de montain bike.

No caso do BMX, o relatório do TCU menciona que o local ""encontra-se abandonado, começando a aparentar aspectos de degradação, com sinais de irregularidades e desgaste natural por estar exporto a sol, chuva e vento sem qualquer tipo de manutenção específica.

Em outro ponto da auditoria, é dito que ""as bombas d’água da corredeira da canoagem foram desligadas, e estão em processo de deterioração, assim como as placas plásticas do circuito que se encontram ressecadas"".

O relatório descreve que é necessário ter ações preventivas capazes de controlar a ""atual situação de emergência, minimizar consequências negativas, como desuso e abandono, o mais rápido possível"".

Um relator do TCU menciona ainda ""abandono precoce do Comitê Rio 2016"" às construções olímpicas.

Outro ponto bastante abordado foi quanto à prometida e festejada Floresta dos Atletas, que jamais virou realidade. ""A plantação de 12 mil mudas no parque, por enquanto, está apenas na memória das belas imagens da cerimônia de encerramento dos Jogos Olímpicos, quando foram semeadas pelos atletas"".

A iniciativa virou um verdadeiro jogo de empurra, já que, segundo diz o relatório, a prefeitura do Rio disse que caberia ao Comitê Rio 2016, que por sua vez rebateu que tal proposta não estava prevista no caderno de encargos ""pois não foi assinado nenhum compromisso específico"".

A promessa feita ao Comitê Olímpico Internacional era de que seriam plantadas 24 milhões de mudas para compensar o impacto ambiental com os Jogos Olímpicos. Contudo, quase um ano após os Jogos nem mesmo as 100 mudas plantadas na abertura e o paisagismo natural do parque sobrevivem. ""Sofrem com a falta de irrigação e manutenção"", diz o relatório.

""Ressalte-se que a tônica de Jogos sustentáveis foi implementada com sucesso na cerimônia de abertura. Ao menos 2,5 bilhões de pessoas, ao redor do mundo, assistiram a esta transmissão, a maior audiência registrada na história do evento. Portanto, ao fazer a promessa perante a comunidade mundial, o Comitê Rio 2016 vinculou-se, sobretudo moralmente, por conta do seu dever de probidade, e não apenas pelo fato de a Floresta dos Atletas e o Bosque dos Medalhistas representarem uma parcela mínima daquele compromisso de plantio de 24 milhões de mudas estabelecido no Dossiê de Candidatura. Consumada tal inadimplência, ficará a frustração causada pelo engodo, pela encenação, o que poderá acarretar significativos prejuízos para a imagem do país"", critica a auditoria.

O TCU determina que sejam levantados em até 60 dias providências para levantar os custos incorridos com vícios de construção e com danos nas arenas olímpicas do Complexo da Barra da Tijuca e de Deodoro e de eventual abandono das instalações por parte do Comitê Rio 2016. Isso deve acontecer até, se for o caso, se precisar de medidas judicias, diz o Tribunal.

É exigido ainda que, em 90 dias, o Parque Radical e todos seus equipamentos tenham uma destinação, dando publicidade à sociedade brasileira da solução que venha a ser adotada. Sobre as árvores jamais plantadas, é solicitado um plano de ação para efetiva execução do plantio da Floresta e Bosque dos Atletas.

Para completar, o TCU cita corte de R$ 35 milhões no orçamento que pode inviabilizar o pagamento de despesas básicas dos complexos olímpicos, como água e luz.

A AGLO, por sua vez, descreveu um custo de R$ 45 milhões anuais, a cargo do governo federal, para a gestão das instalações do Parque Olímpico da Barra da Tijuca. Para minimizar os custos, o órgão diz tentar agendar um calendário de eventos e competições.

1970,3,1.0,"A grande pirâmide de Gizé, no Cairo, é considerada uma das sete maravilhas do mundo antigo.

Mas quem segue o curso do rio Nilo e viaja rumo ao sul, no território onde hoje é o Sudão, se depara com milhares de construções similares, que pertenceram ao reino de Kush (ou Cuche).

Kush foi uma superpotência africana e sua influência se estendeu até o atual Oriente Médio.

O reino existiu por centenas de anos e, no século 8º antes de Cristo, conquistou o Egito, também na África, governando-o por décadas.

E o que restou dessa civilização é impressionante.

Mais de 300 pirâmides continuam intactas, praticamente inalteradas desde que foram construídas, há cerca de 3 mil anos.

As mais suntuosas se encontram em Jebel Barkal, uma pequena montanha no Sudão do Norte que, junto com a cidade de Napata, são consideradas patrimônio da humanidade pela Unesco, o braço da ONU para educação, ciência e cultura.

No local, além das pirâmides, há tumbas, templos e câmaras funerárias completas, com pinturas e desenhos que a Unesco descreve como ""obras-primas de um gênio criativo que mostram os valores artísticos, sociais, políticos e religiosos de uma comunidade de mais de 2 mil anos"".

Os cuchitas eram africanos negros, em sua maioria agricultores, mas também artesãos e mercadores. Eles vendiam ouro, incenso, marfim, ébano, óleos, penas de avestruz e pele de leopardo.

Além de possuir minas de ouro e terras cultiváveis, o reino ocupava uma localização comercialmente estratégica, dado que de lá se transportavam mercadorias pelo rio Nilo e também por estradas que levavam ao mar Vermelho.

Suas riquezas chegaram a rivalizar com as dos faraós.

Mas até hoje o legado de Kush ainda não é amplamente conhecido, inclusive entre os africanos.

Um projeto com objetivo de resgatar o passado do continente nasceu no início da década de 1960.

A África se tornava independente da Europa e, em meio à onda nacionalista, muitos de seus jovens líderes assumiram o compromisso de não só descolonizar seus países, mas também suas histórias.

Tampouco havia interesse de historiadores ocidentais. Por causa da falta de registros escritos, muitos deles simplesmente abandonaram a tarefa de revisitar o passado do continente.

Assim, a Unesco ajudou estudiosos africanos a criar o projeto, recrutando 350 especialistas de diferentes áreas e de toda a África.

O resultado foi uma coletânea de oito volumes que abrangem desde a pré-história até a era moderna.

O oitavo livro foi concluído na década de 1990 e o nono já começou a ser preparado.

Houve polêmica, contudo, em torno da decisão da Unesco de começar a coletânea com um exemplar sobre as origens da humanidade, expondo a teoria da evolução.

O volume provocou a ira de comunidades cristãs e muçulmanas, dado que alguns países da África acreditavam no criacionismo, doutrina que defende que os seres vivos surgiram do criador e não são, portanto, fruto da evolução.

O paleontólogo queniano Richard Leakey, que contribuiu para a elaboração do primeiro volume, diz acreditar que o fato de o ser humano ter vindo da África continue sendo algo digno de reprovação por alguns ocidentais, que preferem negar essa origem.

Apesar disso, continua pouco divulgada a história do reino de Kush, onde as rainhas podiam governar por direito próprio.

O mesmo ocorre com o reino de Aksum, descrito como uma das quatro grandes civilizações do mundo antigo.

Os reis aksumitas controlavam o comércio do mar Vermelho desde seu território, situado na região onde estão atualmente a Eritreia e a Etiópia.

Além disso, foram os primeiros governantes da África a abraçar o cristianismo e em convertê-lo em religião oficial do reino.

Para especialistas, por força da influência colonialista, essa história é pouco conhecida até entre acadêmicos e professores africanos.

Por causa dela, não tiveram acesso a um relato integral e cronológico de sua história.

Hugh Trevor-Roper, um dos mais destacados historiadores britânicos de todos os tempos, diz: ""Talvez no futuro será possível ensinar algo sobre a história da África. Mas até o momento não há nenhuma ou quase nenhuma: só existe a história dos europeus na África"".

""O resto é escuridão, assim como ocorre com a história pré-europeia e a pré-colombiana na América. Uma escuridão que não é sujeito para a história"", completou.

A declaração é de 1965, mas continua atual.

Thomas Piketty - Porque, apesar dos avan�os dos �ltimos anos, o Brasil continua sendo um dos pa�ses mais desiguais do mundo. Em nossa base de dados, s� encontramos grau de desigualdade semelhante na �frica do Sul e em pa�ses do Oriente M�dio.

A hist�ria dos EUA e da Europa mostra que s� depois de grandes choques pol�ticos como as duas grandes guerras do s�culo 20 a desigualdade diminuiu e a economia cresceu com vigor, permitindo que fatias maiores da popula��o colhessem os benef�cios.

O sistema tribut�rio � pouco progressivo no Brasil. H� isen��es para rendas de capital, como os dividendos pagos pelas empresas a seus acionistas. Impostos sobre rendas mais altas e heran�as t�m al�quotas muito baixas no Brasil, se comparadas com o que se v� em pa�ses mais avan�ados.

Alguns desses pa�ses fazem isso h� um s�culo, o que contribuiu para reduzir a concentra��o da riqueza. Se voc� olhar os Estados Unidos, a Alemanha, a Fran�a, o Jap�o, em todos esses pa�ses a al�quota mais alta do Imposto de Renda est� entre 35 e 50%. [No Brasil, a al�quota m�xima do Imposto de Renda � de 27,5%.]

A elite sempre tem um monte de desculpas para n�o pagar impostos, e isso tamb�m ocorre em outras partes do mundo. A quest�o � saber por que a elite no Brasil tem sido bem-sucedida ao evitar mudan�as no sistema tribut�rio.

Em outros pa�ses, as elites n�o aceitaram pacificamente pagar mais impostos. Foi um processo ca�tico e violento muitas vezes. Espero que o Brasil tenha mais sorte e possa fazer isso sem passar por choques traum�ticos como as guerras. � deprimente ver que d�cadas de democracia no Brasil foram incapazes de promover mudan�as nessa �rea.

Voc� precisa fazer as duas coisas. Morgan mostra que as pol�ticas sociais adotadas nos �ltimos anos foram boas para os pobres, mas insuficientes. Voc� precisa melhorar as condi��es de vida deles e investir em educa��o e infraestrutura, mas precisa de um sistema tribut�rio mais justo para financiar isso e reduzir a concentra��o da renda no topo.

N�o estou aqui para dar li��es a ningu�m. H� muita hipocrisia no meu pa�s quando se trata desse assunto. Mas acredito que no fim todos se beneficiam com um sistema tribut�rio mais justo e uma sociedade menos desigual, mais inclusiva e mais est�vel.

Governo decide manter o horário de verão a partir do dia 15 de outubro

Matéria publicada em 25 de setembro de 2017, 15:17 horas

Brasil- O governo decidiu manter o horário de verão em 2017. A medida foi confirmada nesta segunda-feira (25) pelo ministério de Minas e Energia. Com a decisão, os moradores das regiões Sul, Sudeste e Centro-Oeste deverão adiantar os relógios em 1 hora a partir do dia 15 de outubro.

Na semana passada, o final de horário de verão chegou a ser cogitado pelo governo, após estudos mostrando perda na efetividade da medida, em razão das mudanças nos hábitos de consumo de energia. De acordo com o Operador Nacional do Sistema (ONS), a temperatura é quem determina o maior consumo de energia e não a incidência da luz durante o dia, fazendo com que, atualmente, os picos de consumo ocorram no horário entre 14h e 15h, e não mais entre 17h e 20h.

O ONS aponta que no horário de verão praticado em 2016/2017 a economia foi de R$ 159,5 milhões, valor abaixo período de 2015/2016, que foi de R$ 162 milhões.

O governo informou que, para 2018, deve fazer uma pesquisa para decidir se mantém ou não o horário diferenciado nos próximos anos.

A escassez de chuvas e o baixo nível dos reservatórios das hidrelétricas este ano pesou na decisão do governo de manter o horário de verão este ano. Apesar de descartar o acionamento das usinas termelétricas, cujo custo está acima do preço da energia no mercado à vista, o Comitê de Monitoramento do Setor Elétrico (CMSE) autorizou o aumento da importação de energia da Argentina e do Uruguai e uma campanha de estímulo à economia de energia.

Além disso, a expectativa é que, em outubro, o governo deve passar a cobrar a bandeira vermelha, possivelmente na faixa dois. Atualmente, está em vigor a tarifa amarela na cobrança da conta de luz. Essa tarifa representa um acréscimo de R$ 2 a cada 100 quilowatts-hora (kWh) consumidos. Com a adoção da tarifa vermelha, o preço da tarifa de energia passa a ter um acréscimo vai a R$ 3 por 100 kWh. No caso do patamar dois, esse valor seria maior: R$ 3,50 a cada 100 kWh consumidos.

De acordo com informações fornecidas pelo MAM ao G1, o público presente na performance era formado essencialmente por artistas e uma das pessoas que prestigiou a apresentação foi a coreógrafa Elisabete Finger acompanhada da filha. O vídeo (acima) que viralizou nas redes sociais mostra o momento em que Schwartz está nu enquanto Elisabete incentiva a filha a tocá-lo.

De acordo com posts públicos no perfil de Elisabete no Facebook – o qual foi fechado para amigos após a divulgação de seu nome – a coreógrafa é militante do Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), apoiando desde a campanha de Dilma Rousseff em 2014 até o atual “Fora Temer”.

As coincidências não param por aí. Elisabete Finger trabalhou por três anos e meio (até junho de 2017) como apresentadora de um projeto do Itaú Cultural chamado “Discoreografia – Música, Dança e Blá, Blá, Blá“, braço cultural do Banco Itaú que também é financiado por meio da Lei Rouanet. Na terceira edição do programa, que foi ao ar em 25 de fevereiro de 2014, Elisabete entrevistou o próprio coreógrafo Wagner Schwartz, aquele que incentiva sua filha a tocar enquanto ele está nu. De acordo com a descrição do programa, os trabalhos de Wagner “transitam entre práticas e culturas diferentes” tornando “viável a fisicalidade dos seus experimentos”.

Cabe lembrar que o presidente do Itaú, Roberto Setúbal, defendeu em 2015 que Dilma continuasse no cargo de Presidente da República.

1978,1,,"O caso de uma suposta sonegação fiscal de Neymar entre 2011 e 2013 teve um ponto final nesta terça-feira.

Depois de obter vitória no Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais (Carf), Neymar viu nesta terça a Receita Federal desistir do recurso contra esta decisão no processo fiscal que chegaria hoje a R$ 200 milhões (com correção monetária).

“A procuradoria desistiu do recurso porque nós obtivemos a vitória no caso. O caso está encerrado, nada mais pesa contra nós“, disse o CEO das empresas de Neymar, Altamiro Bezerra.

Neymar vendeu para as empresas do pai os direitos sobre a exploração de sua imagem. Em contrapartida, a NR Sports e a N & N Consultoria pagaram um valor fixo ao jogador e passaram a ficar com as suas receitas de imagem, marketing e patrocínios. Segundo a acusação Receita, esses valores pertenceriam a pessoa física de Neymar – a alíquota nesse caso seria de 27,5%, contra 15% a 20% no caso de imposto de renda de pessoa jurídica, ou 9% em contribuição sobre o lucro de empresas.

O argumento da defesa de Neymar, acolhido pelo Carf, foi pautado no fato de que o jogador e as empresas são entes diferentes: o novo camisa 10 do Paris Saint-Germain não é sócio em nenhuma delas. Por isso, seria perfeitamente normal que possa negociar seus direitos de imagem com elas sem que haja simulação.

As irregularidades vão de transações incompatíveis com o patrimônio, saques em espécie, resistência em informar o motivo da transação e a incapacidade de comprovar a origem legal dos recursos. O relatório, com todos os dados, foi enviado à CPI do BNDES.

Entre as transações incompatíveis com o patrimônio, o Coaf constatou que ex-presidente Lula aplicou R$ 6,2 milhões em um plano de previdência privada da seguradora BrasilPrev. Por se tratar de uma operação de mais de R$ 1 milhão no mercado segurador, logo entrou no radar do Coaf. Lula investiu ainda cerca de R$ 13 milhões em aplicações financeiras não especificadas.

Outra operação que chamou atenção do Coaf reforçou as suspeitas sobre a verdadeira identidade do dono de um sítio em Atibaia.

Também foram identificadas transferências de contas no Banco do Brasil para Lula e seus filhos no valor de R$ 1,5 milhão. A que mais recebeu dinheiro foi Lurian Cordeiro Lula da Silva, R$ 365 mil, em seguida Luis Claudio Lula da Silva, dono da LFT Marketing esportivo: R$ 209 mil.

Todas as operações financeiras de Lula foram apontadas como suspeitas. Tanto as entradas e saídas de dinheiro na LILS foram caracterizadas como incompatíveis pelo Coaf. De acordo com o relatório do conselho, houve “movimentação de recursos incompatível com o patrimônio, a atividade econômica ou ocupação profissional e a capacidade financeira do cliente”.

Segundo o diretor do hospital para onde as vítimas foram levadas, 11 crianças morreram (10 meninas e 1 menino) e 13 ficaram feridas (10 meninas e 3 meninos). As crianças têm idades entre 12 e 14 anos.

Segundo autoridades, o nome do atirador é Wellington Menezes de Oliveira e ele é ex-aluno da Escola Municipal Tasso da Silveira, no bairro de Realengo, onde foi o ataque. Seu corpo foi retirado por volta das 12h20, segundo os bombeiros. De acordo com polícia, Wellington não tinha antecedentes criminais.

A polícia diz que ele portava dois revólveres calibre 38 e equipamento para recarregar rapidamente a arma. Esse tipo de revólver tem capacidade para 6 balas.

Segundo testemunhas, Wellington baleou duas pessoas ainda do lado de fora da escola e entrou no colégio dizendo que faria uma palestra.

De acordo com a Secretaria Municipal de Saúde, ele falou com uma professora e seguiu para uma sala de aula. O barulho dos tiros atraiu muitas pessoas para perto da escola (Presenciou o caso? Envie fotos e vídeos ao VC no G1).

O sargento Márcio Alves, da Polícia Militar, fazia uma blitz perto da escola e diz foi chamado por um aluno baleado. ""Seguimos para a escola. Eu cheguei, já estavam ocorrendo os tiros, e, no segundo andar, eu encontrei o meliante saindo de uma sala. Ele apontou a arma em minha direção, foi baleado, caiu na escada e, em seguida, cometeu suicídio"", disse o policial (veja abaixo a declaração, em reportagem do Jornal Hoje).

A escola foi isolada, e os feridos foram levados para hospitais. Os casos mais graves foram levados para o hospital estadual Albert Schweitzer, que fica no mesmo bairro o colégio.

Sobrevivente conta como foi

Uma das alunas lembra os momentos de terror na unidade. A menina de 12 anos disse que viu o atirador entrar na escola. Ela estava dentro da sala de aula quando ele abriu fogo contra os alunos.

“Ele começou a atirar. Eu me agachei e, quando vi, minha amiga estava atingida. Ele matou minha amiga dentro da minha sala”, conta ela, que afirma que estava no pátio na hora em que o atirador entrou na escola.

“Ele estava bem vestido. Subiu para o segundo andar e eu ouvi dois tiros. Depois, todos os alunos subiram para suas salas. Depois ele subiu para o terceiro andar, onde é a minha sala, entrou e começou a atirar”, completou.

HIV

O subprefeito da Zona Oeste, Edmar Teixeira, afirmou que Wellington Menezes deixou uma carta em que contava ser portador do vírus HIV. Segundo a Polícia Militar, ele era ex-aluno. Posteriormente, a íntegra da carta foi divulgada, e não havia menção a HIV.

De acordo com o coronel Djalma Beltrami, a carta de Wellington tinha inscrições complicadas. “Ele tinha a determinação de se suicidar depois da tragédia”, contou Beltrami. A carta foi entregue a agentes da Divisão de Homicídios.

Conhecido na escola por ser ex-aluno, ele teria entrado sob alegação de que iria fazer uma palestra. Segundo a polícia ele usou dois revólveres, que chegou a recarregar várias vezes.

1982,1,,"O novo filme de Guillermo Del Toro, “A Forma da Água”, tem estreia agendada para 11 de janeiro nos cinemas brasileiros, e os fãs do diretor (e de fantasia em geral) têm motivos de sobra para registrar a data no calendário desde já. Vencedor do Leão de Ouro em Veneza e recebido calorosamente por onde passou até agora, o longa marcou a abertura do Festival do Rio nesta quinta, dia 5. Confira abaixo nossas primeiras impressões.

Ao longo de mais de três décadas, Del Toro sempre demonstrou ter devoção pelas criaturas que inventa. Universos como os de “Hellboy” e “O Labirinto do Fauno”, habitados por todo tipo de monstro, fazem parte de uma espécie de religião para ele: carregam significados importantes e são capazes de fazer parecer que tudo é possível, justamente porque olham para o mundo sem a viseira cada vez mais comum do cinismo. Nesse sentido, é difícil encontrar no cinema mainstream atual (e mesmo dentro de sua carreira) uma celebração da esperança mais impactante do que “A Forma da Água”.

No centro do longa está o relacionamento entre Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a zeladora de um laboratório do governo americano, e a criatura anfíbia (Doug Jones) detida ali para a realização de experimentos. Ela é muda e, por isso, diferente dos demais, o que torna ainda mais significativo esse contato quase ingênuo, despido de preconceitos, entre duas figuras antes solitárias. Ao redor do casal, que dá corpo à essa combinação de romance e fantasia, estão personagens também discriminados: uma mulher negra marcada pelas expectativas injustas da sociedade; um idoso que hesita em abraçar sua realidade e se recolhe diante da intolerância; e um cientista que, por razões variadas, tenta resistir a uma visão de mundo míope, incapaz de enxergar o outro.

O ano é 1962, mas muito do que se vê ainda ecoa nesses conturbados tempos recentes. A partir da junção de drama social e ficção científica, Del Toro traz o espetacular para o cotidiano, fazendo com que seu melodrama, clássico também na maneira de filmar, encontre pelo caminho os aspectos extraordinários que sempre o consagraram. Na tela, mesmo os acontecimentos mais simples ganham contornos mágicos, muito porque sua lente procura olhares, mais do que palavras. (Vale notar: o diretor já afirmou algumas vezes que, diferente de colegas que buscam atores capazes de recitar diálogos com perfeição, ele procura aqueles que saibam “olhar e ouvir”).

Pela própria condição dos protagonistas, o silêncio é um componente importante da narrativa. Eles, que por natureza não conseguem se expressar verbalmente, usam os recursos possíveis para transmitir sentimentos que são familiares a todos, mas que até hoje ninguém, em tempo algum, foi capaz de capturar por completo. A direção valoriza esses momentos chamando atenção para a postura e as expressões dos personagens, como se cada cena fosse coreografada para favorecer essa comunicação de emoções através de seus corpos.

Dos intérpretes à câmera, tudo em “A Forma da Água” se move com a liberdade de um musical. O filme cresce nesse ritmo, como se flutuasse de situação em situação embalado por uma combinação de temas instrumentais e faixas de produções da primeira metade do século passado — “Uma Noite no Rio”, com direito a performance de Carmen Miranda, é uma delas. Inventivo e ambicioso, sobretudo considerando o orçamento pequeno para os padrões de Hollywood (fala-se em apenas 19 milhões de dólares), o filme toma a trilha como ponto de partida para construir uma homenagem das mais delicadas ao cinema sem precisar recorrer aos grandes clássicos, como acontece com frequência numa indústria bastante focada nos próprios feitos.

Há tanta sinceridade e originalidade em sua declaração de amor pelo meio, por essa forma de contar histórias, que cada plano se desdobra em uma nova descoberta e confirma a impressão de que, aqui, toda joia é realmente rara. Pensando em retrospectiva, a sensação é de que Del Toro se preparou a vida inteira para chegar até esse ponto em que qualquer palavra parece pequena diante da força de suas imagens. Dizendo do modo mais simples possível: fazia tempo que um filme não me deixava assim, tão sem fala e sem fôlego.

1984,1,,"Barack Obama é uma ""pessoa extremamente humana, extremamente doce e que escuta as pessoas"", afirmou ao G1 Tabata Amaral de Pontes, de 23 anos, momentos após encontrá-lo pessoalmente pela primeira vez, na tarde desta quinta-feira (5), em São Paulo. A ex-aluna de escola pública de São Paulo, que se formou em ciências políticas e astrofísica na Universidade Harvard e hoje trabalha em projetos de educação em uma multinacional, foi uma de 11 jovens brasileiros convidados para um encontro com o ex-presidente americano.

Na conversa, Obama fez questão de escutar os jovens um por um, antes de oferecer as contribuições da fundação que leva seu nome para levar os projetos de cada um ""para o próximo nível"", disse a jovem.

Horas antes de conhecer o ex-presidente e vencedor do Nobel da Paz pessoalmente, a jovem publicou, em seu perfil no Instagram, duas fotos do evento no qual Obama se apresentou, na manhã desta quinta:

No encontro cara a cara com Obama, os jovens tiveram que guardar seus telefones, mas, de acordo com Tábata, o clima, que era de tensão e nervosismo antes que ele entrasse no recinto, foi ameno por causa do estilo informal e empático do americano. ""Estava todo mundo super nervoso e super feliz e emocionado, e quando ele chegou estava a maior tensão. E ele falou: 'gente, calma, eu vou até tirar o meu blazer'. Aí ele tirou o blazer, sentou do nosso lado e começou a conversar com a gente.""

A conversa teve dois momentos principais, relata a jovem. No primeiro, Obama pediu que cada jovem se apresentasse, contasse um pouco sobre seu trabalho e relatasse os principais desafios que enfrenta para desenvolver seus projetos.

Quando chegou sua vez, Tábata diz que enfrenta atualmente dois obstáculos principais: o primeiro é conseguir realmente mobilizar os milhares de voluntários que já conseguiu angariar em seus projetos, incluindo o Mapa Educação, em uma comunidade verdadeira. O segundo é encontrar mais líderes que estão atuando em prol da educação de qualidade para todos os brasileiros, para fortalecer uma rede e poder enfrentar ""o ódio e o preconceito"" que ela diz ter enfrentado, mesmo sendo iniciante na atuação política.

Segundo a jovem paulistana, Obama ouviu a contribuição de cada um e depois destacou quatro temas com os quais a Fundação Obama está disposta a ajudar. ""A primeira coisa que ele falou é que ele queria líderes que já tinham começado um projeto e precisavam levar esse projeto para o próximo nível, então seja escalar, seja aumentar o impacto"", diz ela.

O demais itens listados pelo ex-presidente, segundo Tábata, são os que mais lhe agradaram. ""Ele falou das duas coisas que eu tinha pedido, e fiquei muito feliz. Ele disse que pode compartilhar com a gente todas as habilidades dele de organizar comunidades e mobilizar as pessoas e trabalhar com voluntários. E trazer líderes juntos, para que a gente não se sinta sozinho, e para que a gente aprenda uns com os outros.""

Obama ainda disse, segundo o relato de Tábata, que sua fundação vai procurar expandir sua atuação pelo mundo e que procuram ""parcerias no Brasil com fundações e universidades para que tenham escritórios-satélites pelo mundo"".

""Ele realmente olha nos seus olhos e dá aquele aperto de mão. Ele falou pra mim: 'olha, você não está sozinha'. Isso fez meu dia. Estou extremamente feliz, grata por essa oportunidade, muito emocionada e muito animada para continuar."" - Tábata Amaral de Pontes

O jato, que leva o nome de Zunum Aero, funcionaria através de energia elétrica, o que hoje não existe graças a grande quantidade de energia que seria necessária para um voo. A maioria dos especialistas garante que isso só seria possível daqui algumas décadas, mas os planos do Zunum indicam que o jato estará pronto para voar até 2022.

Os voos com esse jato serão para trajetos curtos, não podendo ser internacionais ou transoceânicos. A ideia é oferecer voos baratos, com custos operacionais não chegando nem a um dólar A promessa também é de reduzir o tempo de viagem

Recentemente, a Renault anunciou o seu carro do futuro, o SYMBIOZ, um automóvel autônomo, elétrico e conectado, que deve chegar ao mercado em 2030.

We can stay connected to them by creating our own special rituals, says psychologist and grief expert Kim Bateman.

In 1990, one of my younger brothers died in an avalanche while extreme skiing. He was only 21, and the horrific memory I have from that time is of his body lying at the bottom of a 750-foot cliff, all his bones broken. When he was little, he used to break his bones a lot because he was a risk taker, and the doctors always commented on how quickly he healed. But this time I knew there would be no healing, for him or for our family. It seemed like our identities shattered alongside his body on the rocks.

My son, who was four, asked me, “What happens when you die? Where did Chad go?” Being an academic, I said, “Well, Christians believe he’s in heaven with God, and Buddhists believe he’s going to come back as something or someone else. And there are scientists who believe we’re all made of energy and we just rejoin the natural cycle when we die.” And my son looked at me with wide eyes and said, “Yes, Mommy, but what do we believe?”

When we’re forced to say goodbye to someone in the physical form, we’re also being offered an opportunity to say hello to them in our imaginations.

It was a good question and I started looking to my own discipline, psychology, for answers. Some grief theorists say we humans invest our love or energy in a person and when she or he dies, we withdraw that energy and reinvest it in other people or projects. While that perspective may help some, it missed the mark for me. Because when we lose a loved one, we still love them. And I wasn’t ready to stop loving.

Then I came across this Japanese proverb, which said, “My barn having burned to the ground, I can now see the moon.” I loved this quote, because it introduced me to the idea that when we’re forced to say goodbye to someone in the physical form, we’re also being offered an opportunity to say hello to them in our imaginations. Although gone in the material world, our loved ones can become more psychologically present to us.

And we can use this presence to create rituals that will bring them back and provide us with a means through which we can still love them. One example comes from a folktale I’ve heard about a woman named Nyctea, which means “of the night” and evokes the spirit of the owl. Nyctea’s job is to protect that which is in danger of being lost in this world, so her cave is filled with bones. She has mouse bones and rattlesnake bones and hawk bones and coyote bones, but the most precious bones are those of her namesake, the owl. She combs the mountains and riverbeds and gathers them one by one, bringing them back to her cave. There, she patiently reconstructs the owl’s skeleton. When the skeleton is complete, she sits by her fire and thinks of what song she will sing. In this quiet moment of love, the great drum of her heart becomes audible. The rhythm gives rise to a song and she sings into being the owl’s smooth feathers, its broad wings and its round eyes. On her last note, she breathes life into the owl, and when it feels that life in its lungs, its yellow-green eyes open wide and it flies up out of the cave and into the world.

We must gather our loved ones’ bones and piece them together — they will be the lifeline that carries us through our grief.

When we grieve, aren’t we all a little like Nyctea? Aren’t we collecting bones and protecting that which is in danger of being lost? When my brother died, I remember that every word he had written suddenly seemed important. We wanted to dance to his music and to smell his clothes. The small pin he owned that said “Just visiting this planet” seemed like a premonition. We must gather our loved ones’ bones and piece them together — they will be the lifeline that carries us through our grief.

As a clinical psychologist, I’ve taught about death and dying and facilitated grief workshops for more than 20 years. I’ve seen many people sing over bones, each in their own way. One woman in my town lost her 18-month-old son in a horrific car accident. Two months after it occurred, when she was living in the most jagged places of mourning, she re-read the sheriff’s report. It said an unsecured car seat may have contributed to the fatality. So she set up car seat checkpoints and people lined up for blocks. She was a tiny person, and she’d get into each car, put her knee in there, and pry and pull and tug until the seat was secure. She said every time she pulled on a seat belt, she felt like she was loving her son.

I worked with a six-year-old girl whose mother died of breast cancer. She also felt responsible for her little brother who was only four, and her father was beside himself with grief. I said, “Tell me about your mother,” and she told me, “Mama loved tea.” She came up with the idea of holding a tea party for her. On Sundays, she’d set places for her brother, herself and her mother, and she and her brother would tell their mother about what happened to them that week. After a couple of months, even their father joined in. That girl is now in college, and she says it’s still a meaningful ritual. Whenever she wants to talk to her mother, she just puts an empty teacup across the table from herself.

Another woman lost her husband after 45 years of marriage. Since he was the one who drove, she decided she’d walk or take the bus instead. Through an interminable, gray, windy winter, she kept noticing one thing. It seemed like everywhere she went, there were single gloves laying on the ground. Something about these gloves spoke to her because they were useless without their mate, so she bent down and picked them up. She started bringing them home and put them in a dresser drawer until it overflowed. Then, she took out her husband’s ladder and carried it to the tree in the backyard that they’d planted together on their wedding day. She climbed the ladder and hung all the gloves — fastened to fishing lines — on the tree’s bare branches. She said when the wind blows, it’s like they are waving goodbye and waving hello.

When my children were little, on the anniversary of my brother’s death I used to take them to the river with a purple rose (my brother loved the Grateful Dead). The children took turns pulling off its petals. With every petal they removed, I’d tell them something about their uncle and then they’d throw it in the water. Together, we would watch those memories and stories float away.

To create your own ritual, ask yourself what brought joy to your loved one. The more specific you can be with your answers, the better.

How can you do this in your own life? As the story of Nyctea suggests, start by listening to the great drum of your heart. Let it be your guide. Then, there are a number of questions that can direct you in creating a ritual. Ask yourself what brought joy to your loved one; the more specific you can be with your answers, the better. Maybe Nana loved putting up ham pies for Easter, your uncle sang Frank Sinatra in his underwear on the balcony, your cousin wore a shirt under his graduation gown that said “My parents just think I went to college,” or your sister loved the tingly feeling of catching snowflakes on her tongue. Think about your loved one and what they enjoyed.

Also, think about the physicality of the person you lost. Were they small like a bird, tall like a giraffe, or substantial like an ox? What did it feel like to hug them, and who was the first to let go? What smell do you associate with them? Maybe it’s fresh-cut grass, Trident gum, sesame oil, lilac, peaches or clove cigarettes. When you were with your loved one, how did they make you feel? Was it like climbing into a comfortable easy chair and you always felt better about yourself? Or was it more like a rollercoaster ride and they tested you? What values did she or he feel strongly about? Maybe it was a good work ethic, social justice, freedom or fairness — you can try to incorporate that ideal into your own ritual.

When we sing over the bones of the people we care for, we are sitting in the place of the greatest love imaginable. And we’re not only singing up new life for our loved one, but we’re also singing up new life for ourselves. Poet W. S. Merwin wrote, “Your absence has gone through me/Like thread through a needle./Everything I do is stitched with its color.” May your song be colorful, and may you keep loving.

Pelo contrário: o G1540 Lite tem só 1,85 cm de espessura e pesa 1,9 kg, embora ainda carregue uma GTX 1060 por dentro. Custando a partir de R$ 7.199 à vista, o notebook fica em uma faixa de preço entre os gamers “médios”, como o Samsung Odyssey e o Inspiron Gaming, e os mais caros, como a linha Alienware ou outros modelos da própria Avell com GTX 1070. O que você ganha em relação aos mais baratos? Vale a pena gastar mais dinheiro no G1540 Lite? Segura que a gente responde.A Avell acertou bastante no acabamento desse modelo. Não tem muito plástico na composição; a maior parte é um metal que não fica sujo tão fácil e dá um visual bem bacana. A tampa é bem bonita, com o logo da Avell e um LED branco e sutil que tem a forma de um chapéu.O notebook também é confortável de carregar por aí. Com menos de 2 kg, não achei o G1540 Lite pesado e nem muito grande para colocar na mochila. A espessura de 1,85 cm não é um recorde, mas para o hardware que tem dentro eu achei uma ótima evolução. Eu nunca tinha visto um notebook gamer tão fino assim.E não faltam portas para o G1540 Lite: são três USB 3.0, duas USB-C (!), duas Mini DisplayPort, uma HDMI, entradas para microfone e fones de ouvido, uma entrada de cartão SD e outra para cabo de rede. Mesmo com um notebook relativamente fino, a Avell mostrou que dá pra incluir várias entradas. Aprende, Apple!O único ponto que incomodou foi ver o tanto de adesivo quando você abre o notebook: tem um da Nvidia, da Intel, outro da BlasterX, do HDMI e até um enorme da própria Avell, que é de bem mau gosto. Na minha opinião, esse tanto de adesivo estraga a beleza do notebook.Com 15,6 polegadas, a tela tem resolução de 1920×1080 pixels. Para a faixa de preço do G1540 Lite, esperava uma resolução de pelo menos 2K. Mas aí lembrei que estamos no Brasil, e quase nenhum notebook fica nesse patamar, então considero a resolução normal para a nossa realidade. De qualquer forma, a tela é ótima, tem boa saturação de cores e seu acabamento fosco não atrapalha na hora de jogar em ambientes iluminados com luz natural.O touchpad tem um material ótimo, e é equipado com um leitor de impressões digitais que vem muito bem a calhar. O espaço para você deslizar os seus dedos acaba ficando pequeno, pois há botões físicos para fazer o clique com o direito ou esquerdo, mas acabei me acostumando bem no final.O teclado também tem ótimo acabamento, com retroiluminação colorida em três partes. Tenho apenas algumas ressalvas sobre os atalhos, assim como eu reclamei no review do Samsung Odyssey. É até legal variar o que as teclas Fn fazem, ainda mais em notebooks gamer. Mas ainda senti falta dos controles de multimídia e, no geral, a organização ficou bem confusa.Por exemplo, demorei para descobrir o que cada um dos botões de retroiluminação faziam — os ícones também não ajudavam. Dica: os que estão em (+) e (-) controlam o brilho, o que está na tecla de asterisco (*) desliga ou liga a retroiluminação e o que está em (/) abre o menu para configurar as cores. (Demora um pouco para abrir, mas abre.)Logo acima do teclado ficam os alto-falantes, perto do botão liga/desliga do notebook. É um bom posicionamento e o som é alto, mas a qualidade não é das melhores; o áudio é meio raso. Quebra o galho, mas poderia ser melhor para a faixa de preço deste modelo.O G1540 Lite tem três coolers: um para o processador e dois para a placa de vídeo. Ainda assim, notei que ele esquenta bastante. Deixá-lo no colo é impossível, a não ser que você queira fazer um bronzeamento artificial ou simplesmente queimar a sua pele.Chegou a parte mais importante. Com uma placa de vídeo GTX 1060, processador i7-7700HQ Kaby Lake e 16 GB de RAM, será que o G1540 Lite não te deixa na mão? Ele também tem um HD híbrido de 1 TB (com cache de 8 GB em memória flash). O modelo é um FireCuda, da Seagate, que diz carregar um jogo 140% mais rápido que um HD de 5.400 RPM e 50% mais rápido que um HD de 7.200 RPM.O modelo que eu testei também veio com um SSD M.2 Crucial MX300 de 240 GB, que você pode trocar no lugar do SSHD sem custo (!). Não tive o que reclamar no desempenho cotidiano: todos os apps abriram rapidamente, o notebook inicia bem rápido e não engasgou em nenhum momento. Acho que o SSHD já agrada os menos exigentes, mas também dá para colocar um SSD adicional M.2 2280 por conta própria. E você também pode incluir mais RAM (até 32 GB).Como falei no review do Samsung Odyssey, rodei o 3DMark no G1540 Lite para testar o desempenho gráfico. Ele pontuou 3.498 no benchmark gráfico e teve média de 22,8 fps no primeiro teste, enquanto o Odyssey fez 1.752 pontos e recebeu média de 10,5 fps.É uma baita diferença que foi observada na prática. O notebook rodou muito bem os quatro jogos testos pelo Tecnoblog com resolução nativa (1080p), muitos em uma configuração ótima e gráficos no máximo. Olha o resultado:Battlefield 1 — a configuração automática deixou no médio, mas consegui jogar no ultra sem nenhum problema. A média ficou por volta de 60 fps (às vezes até mais!) e explosões ou cenas mais pesadas não faziam muita diferença;GTA V — com todas as opções de qualidade na configuração máxima (porém com anisotropic filtering desativado), a média do jogo ficou entre 40 e 50 fps. Com as configurações de fábrica, que jogou o AF para X16 e manteve a qualidade variando entre alta e muito alta, a média ficou em 60 fps. Em ambas as situações o jogo ficou estável a toda hora, sem quedas bruscas de frames por segundo;Dishonored 2 — rodou no ultra com uma média de 60 fps muito bem, com quedas ocasionais;Life is Strange — como é um jogo mais leve, o G1540 Lite rodou sem problemas a 60 fps na configuração máxima (até deu para colocar anti-aliasing máximo).Considero o desempenho gráfico excelente: esse notebook deve rodar bem todos os jogos que você quiser, e provavelmente nas configurações máximas (ou perto disso).Enquanto o desempenho me agradou, a autonomia da bateria foi pior que minhas expectativas. Às 15h14, tirei o notebook da tomada, rodando Chrome com uma média de dez abas, Telegram, Newton, Slack, Spotify e outros apps menores — navegação comum, e o plano de energia estava em “Equilíbrio” e não em “Alto desempenho”. Resultado: às 17h08, eu já estava com 20% de bateria.Em outro teste, cheguei nos 20% com média de pouco mais de duas horas de uso também. Bem que era de se imaginar: um notebook com hardware bom e fino não poderia ter uma bateria boa. E esse definitivamente é o caso do G1540 Lite.Antes, é bom explicar o preço sugerido de R$ 7.999. Na verdade, o G1540 Lite custa R$ 8.398 ou R$ 7.558 à vista no modelo base se você quiser Windows 10… Isso mesmo: o preço que é oferecido no site da Avell vem sem sistema operacional. O Windows 10 Home custa R$ 399. Tudo bem que é uma tática para “abaixar” o preço, mas não faz sentido vender um notebook gamer sem Windows na versão mais barata.Mas e aí, o G1540 vale esse preço? Pergunte a si mesmo: para meus jogos, uma GTX 1060 no lugar da GTX 1050 faz muita diferença? Nos meus testes, a diferença foi grande, mas eu não sou o tipo de gamer que precisa rodar todos os jogos no máximo.Tudo bem, as alternativas ao G1540 Lite são mais baratas, mas não são tão finas. O G1544 Iron V4X, da própria Avell, não é muito diferente do G1540 Lite (só um pouco mais espesso) e custa R$ 6.958 à vista (já com Windows!). O Lenovo Legion Y720 sai por RS 6.999, também é um pouco mais grosso e tem a mesma GTX 1060.Se você quiser um notebook fino, com bom acabamento e desempenho de ponta, mas não tem problema com a bateria ruim: sim, o G1540 Lite pode te servir.Você pode utilizar a nova extensão do Tecnoblog para economizar alguns caraminguás na hora de trocar de aparelho.

O remédio mais perigoso do mundo

Vicia tanto quanto drogas ilegais. Mata mais do que armas nos EUA. Agora, os fabricantes miram o Brasil como mercado – e o remédio começa a se tornar doença

“Uma amiga minha tomava o remédio, para um problema de dor, e me falou sobre ele. Resolvi experimentar. A sensação foi maravilhosa, como um orgasmo incrível. Eu me sentia anestesiada e muito feliz. No começo, tomava um comprimido por dia. Daí passei a tomar dois, três e hoje preciso de uma caixa inteira para conseguir o mesmo efeito. Se não tomo, passo mal demais. Fico com muita dor no corpo, tremedeira e uma diarreia horrível. Para conseguir o remédio, vou a um pronto-socorro e finjo que estou com muita dor. Se o médico não me dá, falsifico a receita. São coisas que eu jamais pensei em fazer. Mas a dependência é incontrolável. Tento parar e não consigo.”

Essa é a história de Fabiana*, uma recepcionista de 35 anos que mora em São Paulo. Ela se viciou em oxicodona, um remédio produzido por vários laboratórios e vendido com nomes diversos (os mais comuns são OxyContin, OxyFast e Percocet). É um analgésico semissintético parcialmente derivado de uma espécie de papoula, a flor usada para fazer ópio e heroína. Por isso, esse medicamento e seus similares naturais, como a morfina, são conhecidos como opioides.

Eles variam na potência, mas têm os mesmos efeitos: anulam qualquer tipo de dor física, provocam uma curiosa mistura de relaxamento e euforia e são extremamente viciantes. Tanto que, só nos Estados Unidos, 2 milhões de pessoas são dependentes deles, segundo dados do governo americano. É uma quantidade assombrosa de gente, o dobro do número estimado de viciados em crack no Brasil. Os opioides também matam – e muito. Só no ano passado, causaram 60 mil mortes nos EUA (incluindo as do cantor Prince e da atriz Carrie Fisher, a princesa Leia de Star Wars). É mais do que todas as vítimas de acidentes de trânsito e armas de fogo, somadas. Também é mais do que os mortos por aids no pico da epidemia de HIV, em 1995. Um problema tão gigantesco que, em agosto, o governo dos EUA classificou os opioides como “emergência nacional” e prometeu medidas para dificultar sua venda.

Mas como um remédio tão perigoso pôde chegar ao mercado e ganhar versões cada vez mais potentes, sem que ninguém fizesse nada? A resposta é surpreendente – porque é quase tão antiga quanto a própria humanidade.

*O nome foi alterado para preservar a identidade da paciente

Em 3.400 a. C., os sumérios já extraíam um suco branco e leitoso da papoula, que chamavam de “planta da alegria”. Tumbas egípcias do século 15 a.C. contêm vestígios da substância, usada num ritual de sedação para o sonho eterno. Gregos e romanos também usavam a substância. Na Odisseia, Homero fala sobre uma tal nepente, a que ele se refere como “droga do esquecimento” – na verdade, um coquetel de ópio.

Com o tempo, o narcótico ganhou usos medicinais. No século 2, o médico grego Galeno o recomendava para curar coisas tão distintas quanto asma, epilepsia, tristeza e pedras nos rins. No século 16, o alquimista suíço Paracelso misturou a droga com álcool, almíscar e âmbar para criar um elixir contra tosse, insônia, dor e diarreia – o láudano –, que era vendido nas farmácias sem receita até o início do século 20. Claro que nem todos os usuários tinham problemas de saúde. Muitos só queriam se divertir. Os chineses, por exemplo, gostavam de fumar ópio. E viraram os maiores consumidores do mundo, inclusive porque foram forçados a isso.

No século 18, a Inglaterra importava cada vez mais seda, chá e porcelana da China, pagando a conta com ouro e prata. Mas, como não tinha um produto de exportação para equilibrar a balança, a sangria só aumentava. A solução foi o ópio. Os ingleses produziam a substância na Índia e vendiam para os chineses. Mas ela fez tanto estrago que acabou proibida pelo imperador. Então os ingleses se aliaram a traficantes, que levavam a droga escondida. Deu muito certo: o consumo chegou a 2.500 toneladas por ano, com 12 milhões de chineses viciados. O problema levou a duas guerras entre China e Inglaterra, ambas vencidas pelos britânicos. A dinastia Qing foi obrigada a abrir os portos e engolir a legalização do ópio. De quebra, perdeu Hong Kong.

Apesar disso, ninguém sabia explicar de onde vinham os poderes da papoula. O alemão Friedrich Sertürner matou a charada: no começo do século 19, ele conseguiu isolar o princípio ativo da planta e o batizou de morphium – alusão a Morfeu, o deus grego dos sonhos. A morfina se encaixa nos chamados “receptores opioides”, que estão presentes em várias regiões do cérebro e normalmente são ativados pelos analgésicos naturais, produzidos pelo próprio organismo, como a endorfina. Ela funciona do mesmo jeito – só que é muito mais forte. Friedrich testou-a em cobaias e em si próprio. Sentiu euforia, náuseas e depressão. Ficou assustado e advertiu: “É meu dever chamar a atenção para os terríveis efeitos dessa nova substância.”

Ninguém deu bola. Na década de 1820, a morfina já era sucesso de vendas na Europa e nos EUA, graças ao baixo custo e à ação potente. “Pela primeira vez, os médicos podiam prescrever doses precisas”, escreve o britânico Martin Booth no livro Opium: A History (sem versão em português). De lá para cá, a indústria farmacêutica foi desenvolvendo analgésicos opioides cada vez mais fortes. Entre eles, a oxicodona, que foi criada por cientistas alemães em 1917 e usada para anestesiar soldados feridos na 1a Guerra Mundial.

Os opioides sempre tiveram seus riscos. Mas a medicina sempre conseguiu utilizá-los com certa segurança para tratar casos de dores graves, como as causadas por câncer, grandes queimaduras ou traumatismos. Nesses casos, eles continuam a ser indicados. “Se a medicina indica, os opioides devem ser usados, sim”, diz o psiquiatra Danilo Baltieri, professor da Faculdade de Medicina do ABC e especialista em dependência química.

Nem todo mundo que toma um opioide vai se viciar. Basta que ele seja prescrito e usado com cautela. Só que, a partir da década de 1980, isso mudou – graças a um tremendo mal-entendido.

Como a papoula é cultivada e processada

A papoula (Papaver bracteatum) é cultivada legalmente em lavouras na Austrália, na Espanha e na França. Ela é parente da P. Somneferum, usada para fazer ópio, mas não contém morfina.

O agricultor seca e mói as flores, que se transformam num pó. Esse pó é vendido para laboratórios farmacêuticos.

O laboratório extrai uma substância, a paramorfina (também conhecida como tebaína), do pó. Ela não é analgésica.

A paramorfina é misturada com acetato de sódio, tolueno e peróxido de hidrogênio. Após uma série de reações químicas, ela vira oxicodona: o princípio ativo dos analgésicos opioides.

A oxicodona é misturada com excipiente (pó inerte) e prensada no formato de comprimidos. O laboratório pode incluir outras substâncias na fórmula, como naloxona (que reduz a potência do opiáceo).

Para tudo e para todos

Em 1980, o médico Hershel Jick, da Universidade de Boston, teve a ideia de fazer um estudo sobre os analgésicos usados em hospitais. Ele avaliou os registros de 11.882 pacientes que haviam sido tratados com opioides – e constatou que apenas quatro deles haviam se viciado nesses remédios. Uma porcentagem baixíssima: 0,03%. “Nós concluímos que, apesar do amplo uso de narcóticos em hospitais, o desenvolvimento de dependência é raro”, escreveu em seu artigo científico. O trabalho de Hershel passou batido até 1986, quando foi citado na revista médica Pain, da Sociedade Americana de Dor. Daí tudo explodiu. Médicos, cientistas e – claro – laboratórios farmacêuticos começaram a usar os dados de Hershel para dizer que os opioides não eram perigosos e podiam ser receitados numa boa para diversos tipos de dor.

Por essa lógica, todo mundo que tinha algum tipo de dor crônica (não só os pacientes com casos graves) poderia tomar esses remédios. A imprensa logo embarcou na história e publicou uma série de reportagens exaltando a segurança e a eficiência daqueles produtos maravilhosos. Nos anos 1990, uma nova doutrina começou a ganhar força entre os médicos: em vez de apenas reduzir a dor crônica, como até então se fazia, o ideal era acabar com ela. Afinal, se existem analgésicos tão eficientes, e aparentemente tão seguros, por que não?

Só que todo mundo ignorou o óbvio: o estudo do Dr. Hershel era sobre pacientes internados, que recebiam doses rigidamente controladas dos remédios. Uma situação completamente diferente de pegar uma caixinha na farmácia. Ninguém sabia como as pessoas iriam se comportar quando pudessem levar aqueles medicamentos para casa e tomar o quanto quisessem. Começava, ali, a epidemia que iria espalhar viciados pelo mundo – inclusive no Brasil.

“Nós temos visto cada vez mais casos. Em geral, são problemas gravíssimos”, diz o psiquiatra Arthur Guerra, coordenador do Programa de Álcool e Drogas da Faculdade de Medicina da USP. “As pessoas imaginam que só o crack destrói as pessoas. Mas os dependentes de opioides também chegam destruídos ao consultório”, confirma Danilo Baltieri. A pessoa deixa de trabalhar e estudar e passa a viver em função do remédio, chegando a cometer crimes para conseguir dinheiro e comprar o medicamento. Em alguns casos, também são viciados em outras substâncias. “Antes do OxyContin, eu já bebia”, diz Fabiana. Sua voz tremia enquanto ela falava com a SUPER. É que, no dia da entrevista, ela tinha tomado menos comprimidos do que de costume, na enésima tentativa de parar. Fabiana é tratada por um médico que aceitou apresentá-la à SUPER, com a condição de que a identidade da paciente fosse preservada.

Em 2007, a Justiça dos EUA entendeu que o fabricante do OxyContin enganou os médicos, pois subestimou os riscos do remédio, e condenou a empresa a pagar uma multa de US$ 634 milhões. Mas isso não foi o suficiente para frear a escalada dos opioides nos Estados Unidos. Ela alcançou o auge em 2012, quando os médicos americanos assinaram 289 milhões de receitas desses remédios. De lá para cá, com a pressão contra os opioides, o consumo caiu um pouco. Mas se mantém elevadíssimo: no ano passado, foram 245 milhões de receitas, o equivalente a uma caixinha de remédio para cada adulto do país. “Nós estamos na era dos comprimidos, e é difícil dizer não a pacientes desesperados”, diz o americano Ethan Nadelmann, fundador da ONG Drug Policy Alliance. “Também há médicos que não sabem tratar a dor, nem têm tempo para os pacientes. É mais simples receitar um comprimido”, afirma. Essa situação é agravada pelos planos de saúde, que preferem pagar por remédios a sessões de fisioterapia ou RPG (reeducação postural global), que são mais caras, mas poderiam resolver muitos dos casos de dor crônica. E pelos laboratórios também, já que eles têm interesse em lançar e vender novos analgésicos.

Com a queda nas vendas de opioides nos EUA, os fabricantes estão se voltando para outros países – entre eles, o Brasil. Nosso mercado é um filão largamente inexplorado, pois os médicos brasileiros não têm o costume, como os americanos, de receitar indiscriminadamente esse tipo de remédio (segundo a Sociedade Brasileira para Estudos da Dor, que reúne médicos especialistas no tema, o Brasil é um dos países com menor consumo de opioides per capita).

No ano passado, o laboratório Mundipharma, que produz o OxyContin, patrocinou um seminário no Rio de Janeiro. Tema: dores crônicas, e o uso de opioides para tratá-las. Foi um evento restrito a médicos, mas um repórter do jornal Los Angeles Times, que estava investigando a expansão internacional do OxyContin, teve acesso ao conteúdo. Um momento chama a atenção: a Mundipharma teria dito aos médicos presentes que 80 milhões de brasileiros sofrem de dor crônica.

E a semente de papoula?

No Brasil, o cultivo da papoula é proibido pelo Ministério da Saúde. Mas você consegue encontrar, em lojas de culinária, saquinhos de semente de papoula: um ingrediente que pode ser usado em bolos, biscoitos e pães caseiros, e também adicionado a saladas e molhos. Essas sementes não contêm nenhuma substância entorpecente (o ópio é produzido com a flor da papoula, não com as sementes). Elas são importadas, e só podem entrar no Brasil se o comerciante provar que não possuem capacidade germinativa, ou seja, são estéreis (para isso, basta torrar as sementes). Se você tentar plantá-las, não nascerá nenhuma flor.

Se você aplicar a mesma lógica adotada pelos médicos americanos (de que toda dor crônica pode e deve ser tratada com opioides), inevitavelmente chegará a uma conclusão: esse é o mercado potencial, no Brasil, para esse tipo de remédio. 80 milhões de pessoas.

Procurada pela SUPER, a empresa confirmou o número – mas se esquivou da interpretação. “Segundo uma pesquisa encomendada pela Mundipharma, 15% a 40% dos brasileiros sentem algum tipo de dor crônica, de vários tipos”, afirma Nestor Sequeiros, presidente da empresa. Isso significa, então, que seria correto dar OxyContin em todos esses casos? “Somente o médico pode avaliar a necessidade de cada paciente”, diz.

Também perguntamos à empresa se receitar o remédio para milhões de brasileiros não poderia acabar detonando uma epidemia de viciados, como nos EUA. “Embora a situação fora dos EUA seja muito diferente, com pouco abuso de medicamentos, nós apoiamos os esforços para minimizar esse risco no Brasil”, diz Sequeiros.

A Mundipharma (que pertence à família americana Sackler, dona de uma fortuna de US$ 13 bilhões) reconhece que o abuso de opioides pode causar dependência e morte, e diz que investe em treinamento para médicos e no desenvolvimento de tecnologias de segurança. O próprio OxyContin já tem um mecanismo do tipo: ele libera a oxicodona aos poucos, o que em tese diminuiria o risco de overdose. Na prática, não foi o suficiente para evitar problemas.

Diferentemente de outros medicamentos com ação psicoativa, como ritalina ou Rivotril, o OxyContin não é tarja preta. Ele é vendido com tarja vermelha, a mesma usada para remédios bem mais corriqueiros. A Anvisa diz que isso não compromete a segurança da população, pois o OxyContin só é vendido mediante apresentação de receita de controle especial em duas vias, uma das quais fica retida na farmácia. Mas, diferentemente do que acontece com os medicamentos tarja preta, cuja receita é impressa num papel amarelo especial, a receita da oxicodona é um papel sulfite branco preenchido com os dados do médico – coisa que viciados no medicamento, como Fabiana, conseguem falsificar.

Enquanto o Brasil entra na mira do OxyContin, os laboratórios farmacêuticos preparam os sucessores dele. Em 2014, chegou ao mercado americano o mais polêmico: o Zohydro, dez vezes mais potente que os outros. É tão forte, mas tão forte, que apenas dois comprimidos já podem levar à morte (para crianças, basta um). A Food & Drug Administration (FDA), que regula os medicamentos nos EUA, não queria deixar o produto chegar ao mercado – seus conselheiros votaram, por 11 a 2, contra o lançamento dele. Sob pressão, a agência acabou liberando o remédio alguns meses depois. Ele é produzido pelo laboratório americano Alkermes – que também vende o remédio Vivitrol, para tratar viciados em opioides. (A SUPER procurou o Alkermes ao longo de uma semana, mas não obteve resposta.)

Neste ano, pela primeira vez a FDA tirou do mercado um opioide, o Opana ER. Ele tinha um mecanismo de segurança: liberava seu princípio ativo lentamente, ao longo de 12 horas. Por isso, não dava “barato”. Pelo menos em tese. Os usuários descobriram que bastava amassar o comprimido e inalar o pó para ter a mesma lufada de prazer. Então seu fabricante, o laboratório Endo Pharmaceuticals, reformulou a droga: revestiu a pílula para impedir que fosse esmagada. Mas os viciados logo aprenderam como tirar a proteção e injetar o pó do remédio na veia. Muitos compartilhavam as agulhas – o que causou um surto de HIV nos Estados Unidos.

Enquanto a epidemia rola solta por lá, o alarme começa a soar no Brasil. “Um sinal de que o uso de opioides é um problema aqui são as chamadas ‘populações escondidas’, que não participam das grandes pesquisas”, diz Danilo Baltieri, da Faculdade de Medicina do ABC. É o caso de anestesistas, enfermeiros e cirurgiões, que têm acesso a medicamentos potentes. “O uso de opioides está aumentando nesses grupos”, afirma. “Também cresce o uso entre pessoas que já têm dependência de alguma droga e querem experimentar novas”, diz Arthur Guerra, da USP.

O vício em opioides é tratado com metadona: um opioide sintético mais leve, que alivia os sintomas de abstinência provocados pela falta do medicamento. O problema é que a pessoa adquire um novo vício, em metadona – que é menos agressiva, mas também pode ser um problema. E nem sempre funciona. “Eu comecei a fazer tratamento com metadona, mas não melhorei”, afirma Fabiana.

Os opioides são tão viciantes que, nos Estados Unidos, o cerco a eles fez com que muitos usuários migrassem para drogas ilegais, como a heroína (nome popular da diamorfina, um opioide derivado da papoula). Tanto que o número de mortes por heroína quase quadriplicou por lá desde 2010. “Hoje, 80% dos novos usuários de heroína começaram nos analgésicos opioides, prescritos por um médico”, diz Nora Volkow, diretora do Instituto Nacional Contra o Abuso de Drogas (NIDA), dos EUA.

E o mercado ilegal tem se mexido para atender à multidão de viciados. Um dos novos produtos é uma mistura de heroína com fentanil – um opioide sintético, que não leva papoula na composição, mas é cem vezes mais potente que a morfina. Bastam 2 miligramas desse coquetel para matar. Foi o que aconteceu em junho com o menino Alton Banks, de 10 anos. Ele não resistiu após ter contato (não se sabe como) com uma mistura de fentanil com heroína. Em maio, o policial Chris Green quase morreu após vistoriar um carro de traficantes. Ele passou a mão na camisa para limpar um pó branco – que era fentanil com heroína. Acabou inalando uma quantidade ínfima do produto suspenso no ar, e só sobreviveu após tomar quatro injeções de naloxona, um antídoto. Nos EUA, as mortes por por esse remédio (tanto o oficial quanto o ilegal, misturado com heroína) dobraram no ano passado.

Mas nada se compara ao carfentanil, que é 10 mil vezes mais potente do que a morfina e já matou algumas centenas de pessoas nos EUA e no Canadá este ano. Seus criadores estavam fazendo experiências com a estrutura molecular do fentanil, nos anos 1970, mas acabaram criando algo forte demais. Tanto que o carfentanil nunca foi liberado para uso em seres humanos. Só pode ser vendido para uso veterinário – em elefantes. Ele é tão potente que os EUA temem que seja usado como arma química. De certa forma, os opioides já estão sendo – na farmácia mais próxima de você.

1990,3,1.0,"Nesta temporada, o único calo no sapato do Paris Saint-Germain parece ser o Fair Play Financeiro, principalmente após a milionária contratação de Neymar. Nesta quinta-feira (05), o jornal francês ""Le Parisien""​ revelou um ""plano secreto"" da diretoria do PSG para poder fazer a equipe se encaixar na regra da Uefa. Segundo a publicação, repercutida pelo espanhol ""As.com"", o clube planeja, já em janeiro, vender Edinson Cavani e contratar Alexis Sánchez.

DESAFIO: O Esporte Interativo quer saber se você sabe tudo sobre Liga dos Campeões! Clique aqui e participe de um game com 10 perguntas!

As duas transferências equilibrariam, pelo menos em parte, a balança monetária da equipe, já que o uruguaio sairia por alguns milhões, e o chileno do Arsenal chegaria sem custos, porque seu contrato termina no fim desta temporada. Pela regra de transferências internacionais, o jogador que fica a seis meses do fim de seu contrato está livre para assinar com qualquer equipe e sem nenhum tipo de compensação financeira entre os times.

O que pode atrapalhar os planos dos parisienses é o interesse do outros clubes no camisa 7 dos Gunners. Vale lembrar que a transferência de Alexis Sánchez para o Manchester City foi dada como certa diversas vezes antes e durante a última janela do verão europeu. Manchester United, Bayern de Munique e Real Madrid também foram clubes envolvidos em especulações com o atacante chileno.

O ""sacrifício"" de Cavani compensaria para o PSG, tanto na parte financeira, quanto no campo e bola. A saída do camisa 9 daria mais espaço e protagonismo para Neymar, e deixaria uma lacuna a ser preenchida por Sánchez no time titular, mas apenas na próxima temporada. Ao lado de Kylian Mbappé, os três formariam um ""novo"" trio ""MSN"". Vale lembrar que o brasileiro e o chileno já atuaram juntos, quando vestiam a camisa do Barcelona em 2013/14. Em suas três temporadas no Barça, Alexis também jogou com Daniel Alves.

1993,3,1.0,"Calcule a quantidade de latas de tinta que você vai usar. Se elas forem de lotes diferentes, pode haver uma diferença no tom da cor. Aí faça como os profissionais: misture tudo em um recipiente para igualar os tons e só então pinte.

Para cobrir o chão, jamais use plástico. Você vai acabar pisando na tinta úmida e sujando a casa. Quem conhece o assunto usa papelão ondulado, que é barato, absorve a tinta que cai e faz com que ela seque mais rapidamente.

Confira a previsão do tempo. Se o clima estiver muito úmido, a tinta não seca. Já se o ar estiver seco ou quente, a tinta não se espalha e a parede fica manchada. Por isso, evite dias com umidade menor de 10%.

Limpeza é fundamental para evitar manchas na nova pintura. Se a parede estiver somente suja, água e detergente nela. Se estiver com mofo, use água sanitária. O desenho lindo que aquela criança pintou na parede com caneta colorida pode ser apagado com álcool. Já os rabiscos de caneta esferográfica só saem mesmo lixando.

Compre a fita crepe mais grossa que você encontrar para cobrir o rodapé. Tire o pó para que a fita grude melhor, e passe uma régua para garantir a aderência. E nada de lambança: comece pintando o centro da parede para então puxar a tinta em direção ao rodapé. Assim o pincel chega mais “seco” no chão.

Vai pintar a porta? Preste atenção nas dobradiças! Para protegê-las, passe vaselina líquida, que vai deixá-las oleosas e impedir que a tinta grude.

Proteja a moldura da janela com fita crepe, mas nem perca tempo cobrindo os vidros. Eles só sujam com os pingos da tintura do teto. Para evitar isso, não passe o rolo em direção à janela, role no sentido contrário. Se mesmo assim caírem gotas, é simples: passe uma espátula de plástico para remover a tinta quando já estiver seca.

Primeiro passe um pincel nos limites da parede. Antes de deixar a tinta secar, já complete a área com o rolo. Espere 3 horas e repita a aplicação. A segunda demão elimina as diferenças entre os cantos, que foram pintados com pincel, e o centro, pintado com rolo.

1996,1,,"O Google anunciou esta semana seus novos smartphones Pixel 2, com telas OLED, hardware potente e uma câmera que promete ser a melhor da categoria.

Normalmente, dispositivos do Google recebem dois anos de atualizações do Android e três anos de updates de segurança. Mas, com o Pixel 2 e Pixel 2 XL, “as atualizações de software e segurança do Pixel são oferecidas por três anos”, como diz a página da Google Store. Isso significa que eles terão suporte oficial até 2020.

Como o Pixel 2 e Pixel 2 XL se destacam pela câmera de 12 megapixels, que recebeu 98 pontos no DxOMark, eles têm espaço ilimitado na nuvem para salvar fotos e vídeos em tamanho original — isto é, sem compressão.

O Google esclarece que esse benefício também dura até 2020:

O armazenamento gratuito e ilimitado com qualidade original se aplica às fotos e aos vídeos capturados com o Pixel até o final de 2020. Depois disso, o benefício de armazenamento de alta qualidade se aplicará somente às fotos tiradas com o Pixel.

Ou seja, depois que acabar o suporte ao Pixel 2, você ainda poderá usar o espaço ilimitado no Google Fotos — mas ele vai comprimir novas fotos para 16 megapixels, e novos vídeos para Full-HD. Enquanto isso, as fotos e vídeos que você tiver salvo anteriormente vão continuar na resolução original.

“Após 2020, não haverá alteração nas fotos que você tirou antes de 2020, e você sempre terá acesso à qualidade original”, explica o Google em comunicado ao Engadget. “Sabemos que as pessoas tendem a mudar de smartphone a cada 2-3 anos, e para o Pixel 2, estamos oferecendo o armazenamento alinhado com isso.”

Quanto ao Pixel e Pixel XL de primeira geração, o Google não esclareceu quando acaba o espaço ilimitado para fotos e vídeos originais, mas sugere que o benefício é para o “tempo de vida” do dispositivo — ou seja, até seu suporte terminar em 2019.

Tudo isso mostra que o Google está realmente levando a sério seus esforços de hardware. Mas será que essa política de suporte por três anos será seguida por outras fabricantes? Eu não estou muito otimista quanto a isso.

1997,1,,"Is it just me or is the behind-the-scenes drama of the Fast & Furious franchise starting to become even more entertaining than the actual movies? Or at least more entertaining than 2009's Fast & Furious. (To be fair, anything is more entertaining than that movie.)

On Wednesday (October 4), Universal Pictures announced that Fast 9 had been pushed back a year to April 2020. Fans across the globe were understandably upset, but no one was more furious than actor Tyrese Gibson, who's been part of the franchise since 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious.

In a lengthy Instagram post, Gibson called out producer-star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson for holding up production on the ninth installment. And it's truly incredible. Not only does he ""congratulate"" The Rock for making the franchise about him, but he also takes a dig at Baywatch, Johnson's summer flop. This is honestly better than that time Johnson called an unnamed costar, who may or may not have been franchise star Vin Diesel, an unprofessional ""candy-ass"" on social media.

""Congratulations to @TheRock and your brother in law aka 7 bucks producing partner @hhgarcia41 for making the fast and the furious franchise about YOU,"" he wrote. ""And like you, DJ even if they call I will not be deleting this post — Gn folks see you in 2020 April #FastFamily right? Nah…. it's about #TeamDewayne #3yrs will it be worth the wait? #NoShaw just Hobbs will this be another #BayWatch? Guys guys just relax I'm just a passionate film critic.""

Problems between the two first emerged last month when Gibson publicly pleaded with his costar on social media to not move forward with the rumored spin-off that will focus on Johnson's Fast character, Luke Hobbs, and Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw. Gibson's comment on Johnson's Instagram has since been deleted, but it looks like The Rock is back to ignoring his brother's calls and texts. Yikes.

While it's arguably a bummer that fans have to wait another year for Fast 8, getting a Hobbs-centric film in return feels like a fair trade. At this point, it's clear that the Fast familia could use some time apart.

Recently, Michelle Rodriguez threatened to leave the Fast & Furious franchise if they didn't ""show love to the women"" in Fast 9.

2005,1,,"A disputa entre as operadoras para conquistar novos clientes está cada vez mais interessante: como quase todos os planos atuais fazem chamadas ilimitadas para qualquer operadora, o fim do efeito clube é real. Logo após perder a vice-liderança em número de clientes para a Claro, a TIM anunciou um bônus de 2 GB nos planos TIM Black.

Alguns estados são privilegiados na promoção: clientes do Amazonas, Bahia, Distrito Federal, Espírito Santo, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Pará, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul e Sergipe têm direito ao bônus desde o plano de 5 GB. Nos demais estados, a promoção só está disponível a partir do plano de 7 GB. Os planos ficaram assim:

* 5 GB + 2 GB (apenas nos estados citados acima): R$ 99,99

Além de internet e ligações ilimitadas para qualquer operadora do Brasil, o plano dá direito a SMS ilimitado, acesso ao WhatsApp sem descontar da franquia, assinatura do TIMmusic by Deezer, TIM Banca Virtual e TIM Protect Backup com capacidade de 30 GB. Os clientes também podem compartilhar a franquia de internet (mas não voz) gratuitamente com até três chips. Pode ser útil para tablets e modems.

A promoção é válida automaticamente para novos assinantes; quem é cliente atual precisa solicitar a mudança nos canais de atendimento da operadora. O bônus é válido apenas para quem é cliente da modalidade TIM Black Fatura; quem opta pelo pagamento por cartão de crédito fica de fora. Usuários do plano TIM Pós Família também não participam.

Será que a Claro irá puxar ainda mais o cabo de guerra e melhorar seus planos? A diferença percentual em clientes para a TIM está bem pequena.

Acusado de matar travesti é absolvido em 1° júri popular por crime de homofobia no PI   Conselho de sentença considerou que o acusado foi o autor do delito, mas optou por absolvição. Ministério Público vai recorrer.        Por Carlos Rocha e Catarina Costa, G1 PI                     Julgamento tem duas testemunhas de defesa e duas de acusação (Foto: Lucas Marreiros/G1)         O professor Luís Augusto Nunes foi absolvido no começo da noite desta quinta-feira (5) pela morte da travesti Makelly Castro. A absolvição chocou o promotor de justiça Ubiraci Rocha, que prometeu recorrer da decisão. Esse foi o primeiro caso a ir a júri popular por motivações homofóbicas no Piauí.     Causou estranhamento ao promotor que o conselho de sentença, responsável por decidir se o acusado seria culpado ou inocente, ter reconhecido a autoria do crime, mas ainda assim optar pela absolvição. “O Conselho de Sentença reconheceu o acusado como autor do delito, mas mesmo assim resolveu absolvê-lo por 4 a 3 da prática do homicídio qualificado”, afirmou o promotor Ubiraci Rocha, logo após o fim do julgamento.               Corpo de Makelly Castro foi encontrado cheio de hematomas e com roupas íntimas (Foto: Reprodução/TV Clube)        “Isso demonstra infelizmente o preconceito à condição da vítima por ser travesti”, afirmou Ubiraci Rocha sobre o crime. Foram apresentadas como provas de autoria do crime o carro usado pelo professor, um veículo de passeio de cor vermelha, no local onde Makelly estava na noite do crime, um ponto de prostituição.     A partir da decisão dividida do conselho de sentença, de 4 a 3 pela absolvição do professor acusado, a opção do promotor foi por recorrer a fim de que Luís Augusto Nunes seja julgado novamente. “O MP recorreu por decisão contrária à prova dos autos e incompatibilidade na resposta aos quesitos, por reconhecer a autoria e absolver da prática do crime”, disse Ubiraci Rocha.       A travesti Makelly Castro foi assassinada no dia 18 de julho de 2014. O professor foi acusado de homicídio qualificado por emprego de meio cruel. O corpo da vítima foi encontrado com muitos hematomas no bairro Distrito Industrial, Zona Sul de Teresina, apenas com roupas íntimas.               Corpo de travesti é encontrado na Zona Sul de Teresina (Foto: Juliana Barros/G1)        Ao longo do julgamento a defesa alegou que o professor é inocente. ""Não tem prova de autoria nem participação. No dia do crime, meu cliente apenas pegou o carro durante o dia, para deixar a dona do veículo para fazer compras, mas na hora do crime ele estava em casa"", declarou o advogado durante o dia.      A tese da acusação baseou-se em crime de ódio. ""Tem um forte aspecto de ódio, um dos fatos importantes relacionados a isso está na oitiva de uma testemunha, que disse que a pessoa com quem ela teve contato antes a golpeou depois de não ter ereção. Isso estabelece a relação de ódio, raiva do objeto sexual. É dentro dessa linha que o MP vai trabalhar"", declarou o promotor Ubiraci Rocha.

2007,5,,"Com a popularização dos smartphones nos últimos anos, os emojis se tornaram peças fundamentais na comunicação humana. Expressando emoções, eles são protagonistas em conversas e normalmente são utilizados para intensificar as reações humanas em um diálogo feito pela internet. Um dos problemas enfrentados, no entanto, é o uso incorreto dos emojis que podem alterar completamente o significado de uma frase.

“Os emojis com lágrimas nos olhos são os que mais confundem os usuários. Existem os tristes, que de fato estão chorando de tristeza e os que estão chorando de rir, normalmente utilizados de forma errada” explica a linguista filipina Martha Mendoza.

Martha explicou para o Sensacionalista qual foi o episódio que fez com que ela decidisse estudar o uso dos emojis:

“Certa vez postei em meu Facebook que um familiar havia falecido e alguns amigos começaram a postar emojis chorando de tanto rir. Eu não entendi nada e fiquei muito chateada. Na época até exclui meu perfil na rede social. Apenas meses depois entendi o que tinha acontecido e comecei meus estudos sobre o tema”.

Ela ainda frisa que existe um código de ética no uso dos corações.

“Existem seis cores: preto, roxo, azul, verde, amarelo e vermelho. Eles estão nessa ordem por um motivo, sendo o vermelho o mais importante, que significa o mais forte amor. Não mande o coração vermelho se você não ama muito a pessoa ou pode haver um erro na interpretação da mensagem” finaliza.

2008,5,,"Um estudo feito pelo Nupal, o Núcleo de Pesquisas da América Latina, prova que receber mais curtidas nas fotos quando criança no Facebook é um forte indício de que a pessoa é feia hoje em dia. As fotos infantis invadem a rede social no mês de outubro em comemoração ao Dia das Crianças.

“Comentários do tipo ‘nossa, como você era bonitinho’ ou ‘que fofo’ demonstram que a pessoa teve o auge de sua beleza nos tempos de criança”, escreveu Pablo Herrera Bello, coordenador de pesquisas.

Letícia Duarte, uma usuária do Facebook, garantiu em uma entrevista à nossa redação que outubro é o mês de aproveitar para angariar curtidas e compartilhamentos:

“Eu nunca ganho muitas curtidas, mas em outubro minhas notificações bombam! Likes, comentários, elogios e até compartilhamentos! As pessoas veem a foto da criança e acham tudo mais engraçado, bonito e agradável” disse.

Com a moda de avatares comemorativos temáticos, o Facebook já se encontra em estado de alerta para o que pode acontecer no Dia do Pau-Brasil, em 03 de maio.

Para se adaptar ao atual costume da população de andar com dois celulares, um que realmente é usado e outro para entregar no caso de assalto, as lojas estão vendendo aparelhos novos com outro celular velho e sem funcionar dentro na caixa.

“Adorei a iniciativa. Como perdi meus últimos celulares em assaltos, estou sem celular velho para entregar para ladrão”, disse Sérgio Duarte, de 32 anos.

2010,5,,"O Estado de S. Paulo publicou hoje um longo artigo de opinião do general da reserva Luiz Eduardo Rocha Paiva explicando como e por que o golpe militar será dado na democracia brasileira.

É a primeira vez que um dos chamados grandes veículos de comunicação abre espaço de opinião para um membro do Exército brasileiro expressar ideias inconstitucionais.

Rocha Paiva chega a admitir que se trata de um golpe militar, ao dizer que a intervenção será legítima “mesmo sem amparo legal”

“A intervenção militar será legítima e justificável, mesmo sem amparo legal, caso o agravamento da crise política, econômica, social e moral resulte na falência dos Poderes da União, seguida de grave instabilidade institucional com risco de guerra civil, ruptura da unidade política, quebra do regime democrático e perda de soberania pelo Estado”, escreve Paiva.

O Estadão gostou tanto do resultado que vai trocar todos os colunistas por pessoas que escrevem nas caixas de comentário de reportagens sobre crimes, feminismo e corrupção.

2011,5,,"O ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, desembarcou no Brasil para uma palestra no Fórum Cidadão Global, que aconteceu hoje em São Paulo, promovido pelo jornal Valor Econômico e pelo Banco Santander. Desde que deixou a presidência dos EUA, esta é a primeira vista de Obama ao Brasil, e o encontro tem como objetivo “iniciar um diálogo sobre a responsabilidade das pessoas na construção de um futuro melhor”, segundo os organizadores. Após a palestra, no entanto, Obama desapareceu.

Organizações internacionais foram acionadas e procuraram, por horas, o ex-presidente, até que um grupo ainda não identificado entrou em contato revelando ter sequestrado Obama.

“Manteremos Obama sob nossos cuidados até outubro de 2018, quando ele será obrigado a concorrer à presidência do Brasil” diz um vídeo enviado pelo grupo, que já viralizou no WhatsApp.

Um brasileiro que faz parte do grupo que busca por Obama deu uma entrevista exclusiva ao Sensacionalista. Ele não quis se identificar: “A princípio estávamos muito preocupados, mas quando descobrimos que ele foi sequestrado para que concorra à presidência no ano que vem, decidimos atrapalhar a investigação por dentro” contou. “Mais cedo nós mudamos a senha do wi-fi e à noite pretendemos enviar um vídeo, como se fosse dos sequestradores, mas com o gemidão do zap”, disse.

2014,5,,"Com as eleições presidenciais se aproximando, o Facebook já começou a divulgar algumas mudanças que estarão disponíveis na rede social em 2018. Para diminuir o número de brigas, discussões e amizades desfeitas, como aconteceu em 2014, a ideia da equipe de Mark Zuckerberg é dar ao povo o que o povo quer: impedir que as pessoas expressem opiniões contrárias as de seus amigos.

“Todo mundo sabe que ninguém quer ser contrariado. Ninguém está disposto a dialogar ou mudar de opinião, então vamos desabilitar os comentários e deixaremos apenas botões que reajam de forma positiva aos posts” explicou Mark.

Além de retirar da plataforma o campo “comentar”, os botões “concordar” e “aplaudir” se unirão ao “curtir”. Sem brigas e sem opiniões diferentes, o Facebook prevê uma diminuição nas interações, mas um aumento na saúde mental de seus usuários.

“Como uma rede social, nós sempre acreditamos no diálogo e no debate, mas no Brasil isso se tornou impossível, então é melhor deixar as pessoas viverem em suas bolhas, colhendo suas curtidas em paz e torcer para que ninguém converse pessoalmente, porque aí não teremos o controle”.

No texto, é proibido que produtos culturais que “vilipendiem a fé religiosa, promovam a sexualização precoce de crianças e adolescentes ou façam apologia a crimes ou atividades criminosas” capturem recursos usando a lei.

O problema é que a Bíblia está coalhada de sangue de inocentes e crimes aterrorizantes.

“Como vamos encenar ou falar da tortura sofrida por Cristo, ou mesmo o nascimento de Cristo, que aconteceu enquanto Herodes ordenou a morte de todos os primogênitos?”, pergunta um homem de bem. “Temos que proteger as crianças”.

“E o Antigo Testamento, que tem mais assassinatos do que o Notícias Populares?”, questiona uma mãe indignada.

“E o Deuteronômio, que diz uma virgem violada antes do casamento pode ser apedrejada?”, quer saber um seguidor da boa moral e dos bons costumes.

“Judá, filho de Jacó, transou com a própria nora porque… a confundiu com uma prostituta. A história perfeita para contar para uma criança?”, questiona um pai dedicado.

2017,1,,"Aprovada em silêncio aos 45 minutos do segundo tempo na discussão da reforma política, uma emenda estabelece a retirada sumária de conteúdo da internet considerado ""ofensivo"" por candidatos e partidos, sem a necessidade de ordem judicial, e exige a identificação do usuário que a publicou.

O risco de censura, sem ordem judicial, recai diretamente sobre publicações no Facebook, no Instagram ou postagens em plataformas do Google, como vídeos no YouTube.

Na prática, segundo a emenda do deputado Áureo (SDD-RJ), basta que alguém denuncie um conteúdo sob a acusação de ser ""ofensivo"" ou ""falso"" para estabelecer uma obrigação legal das empresas de removerem o conteúdo em 24 horas sob risco de multa em caso de descumprimento.

""A denúncia de discurso de ódio, disseminação de informações falsas ou ofensa em desfavor de partido, coligação, candidato ou de habilitado conforme o artigo 5oC, feita pelo usuário de aplicativo ou rede social, por meio de canal disponibilizado para esse fim no próprio, provedor, implicará em suspensão, em no máximo vinte e quatro horas, da publicação denunciada"", diz trecho da emenda de Áureo.

O texto deu entrada na Câmara no último dia 26 e foi aprovado na madrugada desta quinta (5). Igualmente a toque de caixa, Senado também aprovou a regulação. Agora o texto segue para a sanção presidencial.

""Esta emenda visa estabelecer uma internet totalmente chapa-branca, onde cada candidato vira um TRE em que ele próprio decide o que deve ou não constar na internet"", critica Carlos Affonso Souza, professor da Uerj (Universidade Estadual do Rio) e diretor do ITS-Rio (Instituto Tecnologia e Sociedade).

Segundo o especialista, a emenda contraria o Marco Civil da Internet, que exige uma decisão judicial (com a devida exposição dos argumentos das partes contrárias) antes da remoção de conteúdo na internet.

""EMENDA FACEBOOK""

Na nota técnica preparada para justificar a emenda, que ele próprio apelidou de ""emenda Facebook"", o deputado Áureo afirma que ""não se trata de censura, mas sim de dificultar uma prática que vemos em todas as eleições"".

De acordo com a justificativa do deputado, ""no momento em que o provedor pedir os documentos do usuário [que publicar uma mensagem denunciada como difamante] e for confirmada a sua identidade, libera-se a publicação novamente"". Segundo Áureo, se o denunciante quiser tomar mais alguma medida, terá que fazê-lo judicialmente.

""Essa medida visa diminuir a guerra de conteúdos difamantes por usuários fictícios durante as eleições"", afirmou.

Mayara afirmou que seu cabelo cumpria a regra da empresa para ser usado solto, mas que isso não foi aceito por se tratar de um black power.

Em entrevista ao BuzzFeed News, a recepcionista, que é estudante de psicologia, contou que ouvia piadas racistas de colegas e que chegou a se queixar para seus superiores. Mas a queixa mais grave é contra suas superioras imediatas. Segundo Mayara, elas a orientaram diversas vezes para usar os cabelos presos, amarrados para trás.

""Eu tentei, usei no começo. Mas meu cabelo é muito sensível, começou a quebrar. Doía muito a minha cabeça. Comecei a amarrar de forma mais solta e chamaram minha atenção diversas vezes. Eu não aguentei. Chorei horrores. Acontece sempre na minha vida: alguém implicar com o meu cabelo.""

Mayara disse que tentou manter o emprego porque tem um filho pequeno, mas que não aceitaria mais usar o cabelo preso porque entendia que ele estava dentro do padrão para ser usado solto: ""Tenho cabelo curto, crespo e sem franja"".

""Vinha me queixando à supervisão fazia tempo e eles diziam que não é racismo, que é padrão"", disse Mayara.

A jovem contou que foi aprovada no período de experiência e que, antes de usar os cabelos amarrados, mas de forma mais solta, recebia elogios. ""Eles diziam que eu estava de parabéns, que não estava espalhafatosa"".

No dia 3 de outubro, no entanto, ao completar seis meses no emprego, ela foi demitida: ""Eles dissseram que eu não supria as necessidades da empresa, mas esse era um argumento que deveria ter sido usado no período da experiência"", afirmou.

Em nota ao BuzzFeed News, a empresa afirmou que está apurando o caso por meio de sua ouvidoria e que 51,3% de suas funcionárias são negras ou pardas. Disse também que tem um canal de Ética e Conduta para receber denúncias. Profissionais da ouvidoria entraram em contato com Mayara para apurar o caso.

Assim que o Grupo tomou conhecimento do relato de sua ex-colaboradora, iniciou, de forma imediata, apuração do caso que, enfatiza, não reflete em nenhuma medida o comportamento ético ao longo de sua trajetória de mais de nove décadas.

Alexandre Amorim, fundador da Home Chefs (www.homechefs.com.br) em sua cozinha, em Niterói, RJ

stá cansado de fazer dietas que obrigam você a comer pratos horríveis, que mais parecem comida de hospital? Quer emagrecer, mas sem perder o prazer de comer? Quer ter o corpo que sempre desejou, mas sem fazer dietas malucas, que restringem você de uma porção de alimentos?

Uma coisa é fato: se você quer levar um estilo de vida saudável e ter uma alimentação balanceada, é difícil sempre comer outra comida, que não a sua. Aliás, não temos como saber como certo alimento foi preparado em um restaurante, lanchonete, ou estabelecimentos do tipo, não é mesmo?

O maior problema nisso é que vai chegar aquele dia - se você leva um estilo de vida saudável, com certeza já chegou - em que você não tem a menor ideia do que preparar. O resultado disso é uma das duas opções:

1) Comer alimentos que não são saudáveis, como frituras, salgados ou coisas do tipo.

2) Comer um alimento saudável, sem graça e sem nenhum prazer.

Quem precisa manter uma alimentação saudável por causa de saúde, ou mesmo por questões estéticas, agora tem alternativas ao famoso “franguinho grelhado com salada”.  Continue lendo o artigo, que em breve você verá que opções para levar uma vida fitness não vão faltar!

Uma alimentação saudável e com todos os nutrientes  e vitaminas balanceados ajudam você a perder peso, prevenir doenças e ter uma melhor qualidade de vida. Mas, como você sabe, levar esse estilo de vida é quase impossível quando se tem que comer fora, ou se tem pouco tempo para cozinhar.

Essa dificuldade dos tempos modernos, tem levado uma grande parcela da população à obesidade e a desenvolver problemas de saúde.

Seus hábitos alimentares é que decidem se você terá ou não uma vida saudável. Para garantir uma saúde em dia, você precisa de uma refeição balanceada e, se possível, praticar atividades físicas.

Mas, com a correria do dia a dia, nem sempre é possível se alimentar de forma adequada. O que faz com que você sempre dê uma escapada para almoçar, ou jantar num restaurante, ou mesmo num fast food.

O publicitário Alexandre Amorim passava por este problema. Até que desenvolveu um método que facilitou a sua vida e vem facilitando a vida de centenas de pessoas no Brasil que buscam uma alimentação saborosa e saudável. Além disso, esse método tem ajudado essas pessoas a economizarem um bom dinheiro com refeições fora de casa.

A essência desse método é simples. Para executá-lo, você só precisa se dedicar algumas horas por semana. Está curioso? Então veja como ele funciona.

No final de semana, você elabora um cardápio detalhado para a semana inteira que vai se seguir. Isso mesmo. Tudo. E, após essa elaboração, você faz uma lista de compras com todos os ingredientes que você vai precisar para o preparo dessas receitas. Dessa forma, você já vai ter tudo à mão quando for cozinhar.

Então, você prepara os pratos (de preferência simples), à noite, quando chega em casa. Atenção: Faça numa quantidade que dê para o seu jantar e o seu almoço do dia seguinte.

E, pronto! Você consegue ter uma alimentação saborosa e saudável a semana inteira. O método deu tão certo, que seus colegas de trabalho pediam para ele as receitas e a lista para poderem preparar suas próprias comidas, ter uma vida mais saudável e econômica.

Agora, você deve estar pensando: “Nossa, que trabalhão! Eu não tenho tantas horas por semana para elaborar tão detalhadamente o meu cardápio.”

Alexandre Amorim quando criou o método também pensou a mesma coisa. Afinal, ele não queria perder o final de semana pensando nisso. Já havia trabalhado a semana inteira, e quando chegava o final de semana, tinha que fazer isso.

Então, ele teve uma brilhante ideia...

É quando passamos por dificuldades que surgem as boas ideias e descobrimos oportunidades. E com Alexandre Amorim não foi diferente. Ele percebeu que este método, além de facilitar a vida das pessoas que buscam uma comida de qualidade, ainda gera uma grande economia.

2022,1,,"Há uma certa magia em viajar de trem pela Grã-Bretanha. Talvez sejam as estações históricas, os vilarejos do interior ou as colinas e lagos que vemos pela janela. Na Grã-Bretanha é possível ir de trem desde  extremo sul da Inglaterra aos vilarejos remotos do norte da Escócia. Aqui vão 15 rotas que recomendamos a você a partir de Londres.

Pegue um trem na estação de Paddington em Londres e em 30 minutos estará no Castelo de Windsor, onde a Rainha Elizabeth passa os finais de semana. É o maior castelo habitado do mundo e uma das atrações mais visitadas da Inglaterra. Além do castelo Windsor também abriga a Legoland, um resort perfeito para quem viaja com crianças.

Bath é uma cidade adorável, listada como patrimônio da humanidade graças ao templo erguido pelos romanos em homenagem à deusa Minerva, sobre uma fonte de água termal. Visitar o Roman Baths é programa imperdível em Bath. Outro grande atrativo da cidade é Jane Austen, a autora de Orgulho e Preconceito e Razão e Sensibilidade, que viveu em Bath e ganhou um museu em sua homenagem. O trajeto de trem de Paddington à Bath leva 1h30.

Apenas 2 horas de trem separam Londres da capital do País de Gales, Cardiff. Lá você encontrará uma cidade linda e um povo galês muito acolhedor. Pode visitar os dois castelos centrais, fazer um tour de bike pela baía, conhecer o estádio que foi sede da final da Champion’s League em 2017 e se deliciar com a culinária galesa. Sem contar as compras!

Com uma universidade de mais de 900 anos, Oxford é sinônimo de história. O tour pelos colleges conta a história de alunos famosos como JRR Tolkien, autor de O Senhor dos Aneis, e Lewis Carroll, criador de Alice, e mostra locações dos primeiros filmes da saga Harry Potter. O trajeto de trem leva cerca de 1 hora.

Salisbury é o ponto de partida para quem quer ver de perto um dos monumentos mais visitados do mundo: Stonehenge. Envolto em mistérios, o círculo de pedras pode ser facilmente acessado com um ônibus que sai de Salisbury. Vale deixar um tempinho para conhcecer a cidade e sua catedral. O trajeto de trem leva 1h35.

No meio do caminho entre Londres e Cardiff está Bristol, uma cidade animada e repleta de atrações, dentre elas o tour de grafites de Banksy, um dos mais famosos e misteriosos artistas urbanos, que é de Bristol. Alguns de seus trabalhos mais notáveis estão aqui. O trajeto de trem leva cerca de 2h15.

Menos de 1 hora de trem separam Londres da charmosa Cambridge, que assim como Oxford, conta com uma universidade histórica entre as 5 melhores do mundo. Por seus corredores passaram gênios como Isaac Newton e Charles Darwin, e além de saber um pouco mais sobre seus alunos famosos é possível conhecer um ótimo museu (gratuito) e o jardim botânico. O trajeto de trem leva cerca de 55 minutos.

Para ir a Glastonbury é necessário descer na estação de Castle Cary e pegar um táxi. Mas valerá a pena: Glastonbury é envolta nas lendas arturianas e acredita-se que seja Avalon, a ilha mística dos celtas. Para quem gosta de assuntos esotéricos, não há melhor lugar! Na abadia em ruínas está o que dizem ser o túmulo de Rei Artur. O trajeto de trem leva cerca de 2 horas.

Pegue um trem na estação de Euston e 2h45 depois estará na cidade berço dos Beatles. Do premiado museu Beatles Story ao tour Magical Mystery, Liverpool oferece tudo o que um fã de Beatles deseja – inclusive pequenos shows no Cavern Club, onde o quarteto tocou mais de 300 vezes. As duas catedrais e 7 museus gratuitos enriquecem ainda mais o roteiro.

Considerada a ‘capital’ da Riviera Inglesa, Torquay além de linda é a cidade natal da famosa escritora Agatha Christie, e há muitas atrações ligadas a ela – inclusive um festival anual. É um ponto estratégico para conhecer as belíssimas paisagens e a culinária deliciosa da região de Devon. O trajeto de trem leva 3h42.

A Cornualha parece um universo à parte na Inglaterra. Inspiração para muitos livros e filmes, não é exatamente o trajeto mais rápido – o trem regular leva mais de 5 horas – mas vale a pena. Para aproveitar bem o tempo, pegue o trem noturno Night Riviera Sleeper que sai de Paddington às 22:45 e chega em Penzance pouco antes das 8 da manhã. Com uma cabine individual você dorme em Londres e acorda em meio à mágica Cornualha.

Da capital inglesa à capital escocesa o trem leva cerca de 4h20 e atravessa os campos do norte da Inglaterra e margeando a costa da Escócia. Edimburgo é uma daquelas cidades apaixonantes, com seu castelo construído sobre a cratera de um vulcão, seus becos medievais repletos de história e uma boa dose de uísque. Imperdível.

Embarque no trem noturno que sai de Euston em Londres para sair do agito da cidade e acordar em meio às montanhas das Terras Altas da Escócia. O Caledonian Sleeper é por si só uma experiência e tanto. O trajeto de Londres até Inverness, maior cidade das Highlands, leva 11h20.

A antiga capital viking da Inglaterra é um dos atrativos do norte do país. Ao chegar você irá se encantar com o belíssimo Mosteiro de York,  construído em estilo gótico e ruelas medievais cheias de charme que parecem saídas dos filmes de Harry Potter. O trajeto de trem de Londres leva cerca de 2h10.

Todos os dias esta pequena cidade do interior recebe centenas de visitantes em busca das origens do maior poeta e dramaturgo do planeta: aqui nasceu William Shakespeare, quase 500 anos atrás. Visite a casa onde ele nasceu, a catedral onde foi enterrado e assista a uma de suas obras no teatro Royal Shakespeare Theatre, referência global. O trajeto leva menos de 2 horas.

2023,5,,"Um recurso da Procuradoria-Geral da República pedido a prisão preventiva de Aécio Neves, pelo recebimento de R$ 2 milhões do grupo J&F a pessoas ligadas ao senador, será julgado hoje pela Primeira Turma do STF. Este é o terceiro pedido de prisão contra Aécio feito pela PGR e, nas mãos do STF, o vídeo em que Aécio garante não ter enriquecido na vida pública será analisado e poderá dar ao tucano, além da liberdade, a chance de representar o Brasil no Oscar.

“A atuação é digna do prêmio, a maquiagem está impecável e a iluminação deixa no chinelo grandes produções milionárias do cinema. Caso Aécio convença o STF, teremos um forte candidato ao Oscar 2018” é o que diz um profissional especializado do audiovisual nacional.

A defesa de Aécio garante que “o senador Aécio Neves foi, na verdade, vítima de uma grande e criminosa armação engendrada pelos senhores Joesley Batista e Ricardo Saud em busca dos benefícios de uma generosa delação”, o que, de acordo com outro grande nome do cinema nacional, dá o tom de drama e comédia necessários para que Aécio possa trazer a estatueta para casa.
